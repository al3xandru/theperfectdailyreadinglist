      	<h2>—Andy Hunt</h2>

A hard deadline means no more excuses, no more options, no second chances. It’s literally now or never.
</p>

<p>
Of course, deadlines don’t usually work that way. That’s the part of the <emph>threat</emph> of a deadline, and after the deadline passes, threats usually escalate. The stakes get higher; consequences and punishments more severe. You’re not off the hook—the deadline just hangs around your neck like a millstone that keeps growing and getting heavier.
</p>

<p>
Hard deadlines, with their attendant fearsome consequences, can shut your brain down as the deadline looms, and leave you with reduced cognitive function for up to two days after the event.
</p>

<h3>The Panicked Samaritan</h3>

<p>
What happens to your ability to observe, to problem-solve, even to think clearly when faced with time pressure? </p>

<p>
Researchers have devised a number of experiments to show how your performance degrades under pressure, the most well-known being the “Good Samaritan Experiment.” (“From Jerusalem to Jericho: A Study of Situational and Dispositional Variables in Helping Behavior,” Darley, J. M. and Batson, C. D., <emph>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</emph>, Number 27, 1973.)
</p>

<p>
In this experiment, you start with a group of seminary students on the day of the Good Samaritan lecture. Against this backdrop of being good stewards of the earth and helping and serving your fellow man, the researchers set up an encounter. They took one set of students and explained to them that they had a critical meeting with the dean of their school right after the lecture. It was across campus, and they could not be late—their future careers depended on it. They then arranged to position an accomplice, dressed and acting as a homeless beggar, right in their path to the dean’s office.
</p>

<p>
Sad but true, these devout students, under the pressure of an important meeting, practically walked <emph>on</emph> the beggar’s head in their mad rush to get to the appointment. They ignored his cries, and rushed past—ignoring everything they just heard in the lecture.
</p>

<p>
But a second group was told they had that same crucial meeting, only they were given some spare time between events—they weren’t in a rush. The students in this second group stopped to help the beggar; they took him to the infirmary, cleaned him up, and so on. Seems this group was able to think more clearly.
</p>

<p>
Time pressure hurts your creativity and problem-solving abilities as well. Dr. Teresa Amabile at Harvard worked on a ten-year study on creativity in the workplace, and one of the things she and colleagues discovered was that you are the least creative when you feel time pressure. In fact, it’s even worse than that. Not only are you less creative when battling the clock, but there’s a sort of after-effect: a time pressure “hangover.” Your creativity suffers on the day you’re under the gun and remains depressed for the next two days as well. (Cited in “The 6 Myths of Creativity,” Bill Breen, <emph>Fast Company,</emph> Dec 19 2008.)
</p>

<p>
That’s why it’s a good idea to end a project iteration on a Friday. That’s why you really do need some down-time after an unscheduled, panicked time-crunch. 
</p>

<p>
When your mind is pressured, it actively begins shutting things down. Your vision narrows—literally as well as figuratively. You no longer consider options. It would seem that deadlines, in general, are very bad for your cognitive processing.
</p>

<h3>Timeboxing</h3>

<p>
On the other hand, there’s the very useful, very popular agile notion of timeboxing. We love to timebox everything we can, from iterations to meetings.
</p>

<p>
A fixed, limited amount of time for an iteration (or a meeting, for that matter) helps everyone to focus. You become aware that you don’t have all day to waste, that you need to make the hard decisions now, ship something useful, and get on with it. This is really helpful in software development, because we developers have a marked tendency to take as much time as is allocated, and then some. (We also tend to fill up any available disk drive like so much closet space, but that’s a topic for another time).    
</p>

<p>
In an agile iteration, we like to slip features, not the date (see this month’s <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2010-12/way-of-the-agile-warrior">“Way of the Agile Warrior”</a>). So the date is a hard deadline, but the consequences are manageable: if you were trying to deliver five features, and one of them is not ready, it slips to the next iteration. The good news: you successfully delivered four things. The acceptable news: the thing that slipped will be delivered in a known, fixed time frame.
</p>

<p>
In agile timeboxing, the deadline is hard; it’s not subject to being moved around and slipped on a whim. But at the same time, it should not instill a brain-damaging panic. The difference is in perception and management of the consequences of missing the deadline.
</p>

<p>
For a deadline to be psychically damaging, it has to cause undue pressure and stress; fear of the severe consequences (be they real or imagined) shuts down higher-order processing in your brain, so you can be ready for a rapid physical response. Well, that would have worked great in our not-so-distant anthropological past, but in the modern office environment it’s an unhelpful response.
</p>

<p>
The trick in creating a useful deadline is to make the consequences more realistic and less of an all-or-nothing affair. Agile development is all about taking small bites and avoiding big, dramatic events, from weeks-long requirements meetings to insufferable integration phases to the oft-dreaded and more often skipped Big Testing at the end of the project. Instead of relying on large episodic events, agile development tries to spread the risk out a bit, and is made up of a nearly continuous stream of small events.
</p>

<p>
An agile deadline works the same way. You could have one massive deadline at the end of the project; the consequences are huge, and include your job, your boss’s job, and the fate of the company and your 401k. Or, you could have more frequent deadlines where the consequences of missing the deadline aren’t professionally fatal, but instead include adjusting resources and expectations, and actually help you become more accurate over time.
</p>

<p>
You need deadlines. If it weren’t for deadlines, nothing would get done. But be mindful of the consequences. If the consequences of missing the deadline are fearsome, then you can expect that your brains will start shutting down as the deadline approaches.
</p>

<p>
Something to think about.
</p>

<p>
What’s a guru meditation? It’s an in-house joke from the early days of the Amiga computer and refers to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation">error message</a> from the Amiga OS, baffling to ordinary users and meaningful only to the technically adept.

    <p>Tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It allows you to work with multiple terminal sessions at once. </p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>It is easy to install, and there are many guides already out there, so I won&#39;t cover it in this blog post. </p>
<h3>Tmux terminology</h3>
<p>So, let us start with the basics.</p>
<p><code>tmux server (programm) &gt; session &gt; window &gt; pane</code></p>
<p>The tmux server starts after running tmux. You can work on the attached sessions or detach them so they run in the background. Every server can have multiple sessions, every session can have multiple windows, and we can split a window into multiple panes. The pane is a normal terminal window at the end.</p>
<p><img alt="tmux-overview" src="https://ittavern.com/images/blog/tmux-primer-1.png"/></p>
<p>There are a lot of use cases for it. Tmux makes is easy to separate projects in different windows or sessions.</p>
<h5>The prefix or lead and meta-key</h5>
<p>The default prefix (or sometimes called &#39;lead&#39;) is <code>CTRL</code> + <code>b</code> (or <code>C-b</code>) and it is usually the start of a tmux shortcut or to use a tmux command. When you see something like: <code>Prefix</code> + <code>c</code>, press <code>CTRL</code> + <code>b</code>, and then <code>c</code>. I prefer <code>CTRL</code> + <code>s</code> for example. I&#39;ll explain how to change it in the next section.</p>
<p>As a side note: you&#39;ll find some shortcuts with an <code>M</code> in them. This is the <code>meta</code>-key. It is <code>ALT</code> for Linux, I think <code>CMD</code> in MacOS, and sometimes even <code>ESC</code>. The <code>meta</code>-key is rarely used, but worth looking it up.</p>
<h5>The config file</h5>
<p>You can temporarily change your tmux config by entering the setting:</p>
<p><code>Prefix</code> + <code>:set -g prefix C-s</code></p>
<p>This would change the <code>Prefix</code> as we described it before. If you want to make changes permanently, edit the config file. On Linux, the config file is usually in the home directory of the user <code>~/.tmux.conf</code>. If there is no config file, simply create it, and restart tmux - or reload it (will show in the end of this section). Just put <code>set -g prefix C-s</code> into the config file and tmux will use it after the restart.</p>
<p>There are many ways to customize tmux. Some examples: Vim-like bindings for pane movements, enabling mouse support, setting keyboard shortcuts, and so on.</p>
<p>The easiest way to reload the config file after changes is to use the following tmux command: <code>Prefix</code> + <code>:source-file ~/.tmux.conf</code> <em>(change the path accordingly)</em>. </p>
<h3>Working with panes</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, you can split a window in multiple panes. You can split the window vertically or horizontally as you wish and change it as much as you want. I won&#39;t cover everything in this post, but I&#39;ll show you the basics.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Split horizontally:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>%</code>
</dd>
<dt>Split vertically:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>&#34;</code>
</dd>
<dt>Move to another pane:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>ARROW KEY</code>
</dd>
<dt>Convert the current pane into a new window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>!</code>
</dd>
<dt>Close current pane:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>x</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are shortcuts for resizing, moving panes around, and so on, but those aren&#39;t that important for this primer.</p>
<p>Side note: I just wrote a separate post about sending input to all panes within a window. Feel free to check it out <a href="https://ittavern.com/tmux-synchronize-the-input-of-all-panes-within-a-window/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Working with windows</h3>
<p>I prefer to separate my projects with windows instead of sessions, but that is my personal preference.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Create a new window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>c</code>
</dd>
<dt>Rename current window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>,</code>
</dd>
<dt>Close current window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>&amp;</code>
</dd>
<dt>Switch to next window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>n</code>
</dd>
<dt>Switch to previous window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>p</code>
</dd>
<dt>Switch to window by number:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>0</code>-<code>9</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Working with sessions</h3>
<p>Let me start with a shortcut that I just learned recently.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Overview:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>w</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This gives you a quick overview of all sessions and windows and lets you switch quickly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Show all sessions:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux ls</code></dd>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>s</code>
</dd>
<dt>Create new session:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux new -s new-session</code></dd>
<dd><code>:new -s new-session</code></dd>
<dt>Rename session:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>$</code>
</dd>
<dt>Detach session (will be active in the background):</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>d</code>
</dd>
<dt>Close a session:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux kill-session -t old-session</code></dd>
<dt>Attach session:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux attach -t old-session</code></dd>
<dt>Move to next session:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>)</code>
</dd>
<dt>Move to previous session:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>(</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post hopefully will help you to get started with tmux. I&#39;ll cover more topics and features of tmux in the future.</p>

If you don’t do that, you will end up with a huge mess — I’ve seen it happen.<p>For companies that can’t dedicate the resources to do a monorepo properly, a repo per team is the best approach. The true value of microservices is decoupling teams so they can move independently without blocking each other.</p><p>Also, needing to release the services together, or in a certain order, is a very bad and unscalable pattern. Teams need to be able to move independently. This requires a commitment to avoiding breaking API changes no matter what kind of repo structure you use — and for the love of God, never let more than one service access a database table! A table should only ever have one service that accesses it, and API boundaries need to be enforced as the only way other services get to the data. Do those things and you will be better off no matter what repo structure you use.

A few responses:<p>- The monorepo tooling I prefer at startup scale (NX) does have a learning curve, but it has been pretty easy to maintain using automation (good linting, good build/test pipeline, etc.). For me, learning and leveraging the right monorepo tooling is way easier than having to enforce consistency across large numbers of repos with a small team or watch a low-tooling monolith decay into tightly-coupled spaghetti. I am also in a particular situation where the need for eventual scale is obvious, will come very quickly (clients are big), and the thought of having to rush a scale-inexperienced team (management and devs!) through a monolith-to-microservice migration on a tightly coupled codebase while meeting SLAs is so unpleasant that it makes me a bit sick to my stomach to think about it.</p><p>- The monorepo framework/tooling matters a lot. For instance, NX is small-scale friendly and largely can be overseen by senior Typescript devs. Bazel, on the other hand, requires a hefty context switch and has a very steep learning curve.</p><p>- You are right that releasing all services together does not scale past a certain point. My point is that microservice monorepos let you pivot quickly between all-together (monolithic) releases and individual app releases as appropriate for your scale. With good caching and parallel blue/green deployments, adding new services to an all-at-once build/deploy pipeline just uses a bit more compute for the pipeline without meaningfully impacting the pipeline run times.</p><p>- Having to release services serially in a certain order obviously indicates something is seriously wrong under the hood.</p><p>- You are very right about monorepo tooling/best practices, but I would extend that to any project that eventually will need to scale. Someone has to take ownership and enforce good practices. Spaghetti code can be harder to prevent in a feature-heavy monolith and certainly is harder to deal with for me if it is in many different repos (i.e., several monoliths).</p><p>- You can have more than one monorepo for teams that are very different or have specific needs (i.e., different languages, mobile apps, etc.).</p><p>- I wish I were in a situation where my team could commit to avoiding breaking API changes, but it just is not so because of aggressive development timelines. (I am sure this will change in the future as we scale.) All-together versioning/releasing helps deal with (planned, intentional) breaking API changes very efficiently, because (as long as you can tolerate a failed API call once in a while as a blue/green deployment switches traffic) you&#39;re basically performing the deployment as if it is a monolith.</p><p>Add: 1000% agree about db access. That is very easy to enforce at the architecture/team level.

So yes they can be right-sized in your cloud easier and have tailored performance, but it comes at the complexity of the deployment and management of the system.

For proof of concept and MVP tools, monoliths are the way to go. Solo developers also are much better served with monoliths compared to micro services. But I will say, eventually if you scale big enough it will eventually make sense to leave monoliths behind and move towards micro services. Yes there are exceptions (someone will write, &#34;but XYZ company is worth 9 gajillion dollars and runs on a monolith), but generally speaking I consider starting with a monolith and moving to micro services after you hit market acceptance for your product.

The opposite also applies - you can upgrade 9 out of 10 components to JDK 11 even when one cannot be upgraded, instead of that one module holding everything else back in some monolithic system.</p><p>That said, there are lots of complexities to microservices and it&#39;s easy to mess things up - I&#39;ve seen projects where I&#39;m the first person that figures out that some shared code should actually be a Maven/pip/npm package in Nexus/Artifactory instead of just copying and pasting code across codebases, because nobody has put in the work to set everything up properly before me. Don&#39;t even get me started on day 2 concerns like tracing and debugging, which the article touches upon.</p><p>Other times, even modular monoliths might run into issues because people aren&#39;t good enough with writing decoupled code without too many common dependencies (unless forced by the language and its mechanisms to have proper separation), or aren&#39;t up to par with utilizing feature flags and such properly.</p><p>I think that at the end of the day, all code rots and eventually is hard to work with, which also affects entire frameworks or even languages: <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/brown-green-language/" rel="nofollow">https://earthly.dev/blog/brown-green-language/</a></p><p>Your architecture will sometimes have concrete technical benefits or characteristics to take into account, but a lot of the time most of the actual effects will be organizational - how you will or won&#39;t be able to build everything, who will be responsible for what and what risks any particular deployment or version bump will carry.
