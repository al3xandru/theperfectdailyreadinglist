	  <p>I have a confession. I sometimes get wrapped up in the current news of the day. Whether it’s Covid-19 or politics, I can easily get anxious and distracted by everyone’s favorite histrionic social network: Twitter.</p>

<p>Here’s how I limit my time on Twitter so it doesn’t destroy my day:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I use a very time consuming hashing algo to generate my Twitter password to login. It usually takes a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Instead of this password, my password manager (Lastpass) stores the Python command that generates my password. This ensures Lastpass won’t store my actual Twitter password.</li>
</ol>

<p>For my expensive hashing algorithm, I have a python script (see below). I pass in a password I keep in my head (or run the command from (2)). This then outputs my true Twitter password. The script takes several minutes, and usually destroys the urge to log back in.</p>

<div><pre><code># usage python thisScript.py (password)
# outputs a hashed version of the password to use to login to twitter or whatever
import hashlib
from base64 import b64encode


if __name__ == &#34;__main__&#34;:
    from sys import argv
    times = 1
    site = &#39;&#39;
    # Optionally argv2 adds time to the password generation
    if len(argv) &gt; 2:
        times = int(argv[2])
    dk = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(&#39;md5&#39;,
                             argv[1].encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;),
                             SALT.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;), #Change SALT to a string unique to you
                             iterations=times * 200000000, # Rehash this many times
                             dklen=20)
    print(str(b64encode(dk)))
</code></pre></div>

<p>A couple things to note</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notice <code>iterations</code> - it’s really a <em>rehashing</em> algorithm, taking the output of whatever hashing algo (md5) and then applying the hashing algorithm again and again. This is what makes it slow!</li>
  <li>The SALT here is a string you should create that’s unique to your version of the script. So my version doesn’t output what yours does, etc.</li>
  <li>Be careful executing this and having the command stored in your history. If you add a space before the command, it won’t be stored in Bash history</li>
  <li>This password takes serious effort to enter into my phone! On rare occasions I need Twitter on my phone, I reinstall the app and laboriously type in the password.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully a script like this can help you get your life &amp; focus back on Twitter or anything else you don’t want to log back in!</p>

<p>For me logging out is easy enough to do. Nevertheless, if anyone has any hints on a browser plugin that can regularly log out from social media sites (perhaps deleting cookies, or whatever, after a time) I’d <a href="mailto:softwaredoug@gmail.com">love to hear it!</a></p>

      <p>
      One day in the mid-1920s, a Moscow newspaper reporter named
      Solomon Shereshevsky entered the laboratory of the psychologist
      Alexander Luria. Shereshevsky&#39;s boss at the newspaper had
      noticed that Shereshevsky never needed to take any notes, but
      somehow still remembered all he was told, and had suggested he
      get his memory checked by an expert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luria began testing Shereshevsky&#39;s memory. He began with simple
      tests, short strings of words and of numbers. Shereshevsky
      remembered these with ease, and so Luria gradually increased the
      length of the strings. But no matter how long they got,
      Shereshevsky could recite them back.  Fascinated, Luria went on
      to study Shereshevsky&#39;s memory for the next 30 years.  In a book
      summing up his research*<span>* Alexander
      Luria, “The Mind of a Mnemonist”, Harvard University
      Press (1968).</span>, Luria reported that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      [I]t appeared that there was no limit either to
      the <em>capacity</em> of S.&#39;s memory or to the <em>durability of
      the traces he retained</em>. Experiments indicated that he had
      no difficulty reproducing any lengthy series of words whatever,
      even though these had originally been presented to him a week, a
      month, a year, or even many years earlier. In fact, some of
      these experiments designed to test his retention were performed
      (without his being given any warning) fifteen or sixteen years
      after the session in which he had originally recalled the
      words. Yet invariably they were successful.
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>
      Such stories are fascinating. Memory is fundamental to our
      thinking, and the notion of having a perfect memory is
      seductive.  At the same time, many people feel ambivalent about
      their own memory. I&#39;ve often heard people say “I don&#39;t
      have a very good memory”, sometimes sheepishly, sometimes
      apologetically, sometimes even defiantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given how central memory is to our thinking, it&#39;s natural to ask
      whether computers can be used as tools to help improve our
      memory. This question turns out to be highly generative of good
      ideas, and pursuing it has led to many of the most important
      vision documents in the history of computing. One early example
      was Vannevar Bush&#39;s 1945 proposal*<span>*
      Vannevar
      Bush, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As
      We May Think</a>, The Atlantic (1945).</span> for a mechanical
      memory extender, the memex. Bush wrote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
      records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it
      may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an
      enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The memex vision inspired many later computer pioneers,
      including Douglas Engelbart&#39;s ideas about the augmentation of
      human intelligence, Ted Nelson&#39;s ideas about hypertext, and,
      indirectly, Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s conception of the world wide
      web*<span>* See, for example: Douglas
      Engelbart, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
      Intellect</a> (1962); Ted
      Nelson, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036">Complex
      information processing: a file structure for the complex, the
      changing and the indeterminate</a> (1965); and Tim
      Berners-Lee, <a href="https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information
      Management: a Proposal</a> (1989).</span>. In his proposal for
      the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the
      particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective
      institutional memory,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve
      with the organization and the projects it describes.
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      These are just a few of the many attempts to use computers to
      augment human memory. From the memex to the web to wikis to
      <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project
      Xanadu</a> to attempts
      to <a href="https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf">make
      a map of every thought a person thinks</a>: the augmentation of
      memory has been an extremely generative vision for computing.
    </p>

      <p>
	In this essay we investigate personal memory systems, that is,
	systems designed to improve the long-term memory of a single
	person. In the first part of the essay I describe my personal
	experience using such a system, named Anki. As we&#39;ll see, Anki
	can be used to remember almost anything. That is, Anki makes
	memory a <em>choice</em>, rather than a haphazard event, to be
	left to chance. I&#39;ll discuss how to use Anki to understand
	research papers, books, and much else. And I&#39;ll describe
	numerous patterns and anti-patterns for Anki use. While Anki
	is an extremely simple program, it&#39;s possible to develop
	virtuoso skill using Anki, a skill aimed at understanding
	complex material in depth, not just memorizing simple facts.
      </p>

      <p>
	The second part of the essay discusses personal memory systems
	in general. Many people treat memory ambivalently or even
	disparagingly as a cognitive skill: for instance, people often
	talk of “rote memory” as though it&#39;s inferior to
	more advanced kinds of understanding. I&#39;ll argue against this
	point of view, and make a case that memory is central to
	problem solving and creativity. Also in this second part,
	we&#39;ll discuss the role of cognitive science in building
	personal memory systems and, more generally, in building
	systems to augment human cognition.  In a future
	essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/taylip.html">Toward a Young Lady&#39;s Illustrated
	Primer</a>, I will describe more ideas for personal memory
	systems.
      </p>

      <p>
	The essay is unusual in style. It&#39;s not a conventional
	cognitive science paper, i.e., a study of human memory and how
	it works. Nor is it a computer systems design paper, though
	prototyping systems is my own main interest. Rather, the essay
	is a distillation of informal, <em>ad hoc</em> observations
	and rules of thumb about how personal memory systems work. I
	wanted to understand those as preparation for building systems
	of my own. As I collected these observations it seemed they
	may be of interest to others. You can reasonably think of the
	essay as a how-to guide aimed at helping develop virtuoso
	skills with personal memory systems. But since writing such a
	guide wasn&#39;t my primary purpose, it may come across as a
	more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know guide.
      </p>

      <p>
	To conclude this introduction, a few words on what the essay
	won&#39;t cover. I will only briefly discuss visualization
	techniques such as memory palaces and the method of loci.  And
	the essay won&#39;t describe the use of pharmaceuticals to improve
	memory, nor possible future brain-computer interfaces to
	augment memory. Those all need a separate treatment. But, as
	we shall see, there are already powerful ideas about personal
	memory systems based solely on the structuring and
	presentation of information.
      </p>

      <h2>Part I: How to remember almost anything: the Anki
      system</h2>

    <p>
      I&#39;ll begin with an account of my own experience with the
      personal memory
      system <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>*<span>*
      I&#39;ve no affiliation at all with Anki. Other similar systems
      include <a href="https://mnemosyne-proj.org">Mnemosyne</a>
      and <a href="https://supermemo.com">SuperMemo</a>. My limited
      use suggests Mnemosyne is very similar to Anki.  SuperMemo runs
      only on Windows, and I haven&#39;t had an opportunity to use it,
      though I have been influenced by essays on
      the <a href="https://supermemo.com">SuperMemo
      website</a>.<p>I won&#39;t try to hide my enthusiasm for Anki
      behind a respectable facade of impartiality: it&#39;s a significant
      part of my life. Still, it has many limitations, and I&#39;ll
      mention some of them through the essay. </p></span>. The material
      is, as mentioned above, quite personal, a collection of my own
      observations and informal rules of thumb.  Those rules of thumb
      may not apply to others; indeed, I may be mistaken about how
      well they apply to me. It&#39;s certainly not a properly controlled
      study of Anki usage!  Still, I believe there is value in
      collecting such personal experiences, even if they are anecdotal
      and impressionistic. I am not an expert on the cognitive science
      of memory, and I&#39;d appreciate corrections to any errors or
      misconceptions.
    </p>

    
    
      <p>
	At first glance, Anki seems nothing more than a computerized
      flashcard program. You enter a question:
    </p>

   <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_question.png"/></p><p>
      And a corresponding answer:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_answer.png"/></p><p>
      Later you&#39;ll be asked to review the card: that is, shown the
      question, and asked whether you know the answer or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes Anki better than conventional flashcards is that it
      manages the review schedule. If you can answer a question
      correctly, the time interval between reviews gradually
      expands. So a one-day gap between reviews becomes two days, then
      six days, then a fortnight, and so on. The idea is that the
      information is becoming more firmly embedded in your memory, and
      so requires less frequent review. But if you ever miss an
      answer, the schedule resets, and you again have to build up the
      time interval between reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it&#39;s obviously useful that the computer manages the
      interval between reviews, it perhaps doesn&#39;t seem like that big
      a deal.  The punchline is that this turns out to be a far more
      efficient way to remember information.
    </p>

    <p>
      How much more efficient?
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer that question, let&#39;s do some rough time estimates.  On
      average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I
      was using conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once
      a week. If I wanted to remember something for the next 20 years,
      I&#39;d need 20 years times 52 weeks per year times 8 seconds per
      card. That works out to a total review time of just over 2 hours
      for each card.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, Anki&#39;s ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise
      past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal
      set of Anki cards the average interval between reviews is
      currently 1.2 years, and rising.  In
      an <a href="#Anki_analysis">appendix</a> below I estimate that
      for an average card, I&#39;ll only need 4 to 7 minutes of total
      review time over the entire 20 years.  Those estimates allow for
      occasional failed reviews, resetting the time interval.  That&#39;s
      a factor of more than 20 in savings over the more than 2 hours
      required with conventional flashcards.
    </p>

    <p>
      I therefore have two rules of thumb. First, if memorizing a fact
      seems worth 10 minutes of my time in the future, then I do
      it*<span>* I first saw an analysis along
      these lines in Gwern Branwen&#39;s review of spaced repetition:
      Gwern
      Branwen, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Spaced-Repetition</a>. His
      numbers are slightly more optimistic than mine – he
      arrives at a 5-minute rule of thumb, rather than 10 minutes
      – but broadly consistent. Branwen&#39;s analysis is based, in
      turn, on an analysis in: Piotr
      Wozniak, <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm">Theoretical
      aspects of spaced repetition in learning</a>.</span>. Second,
      and superseding the first, if a fact seems striking then into
      Anki it goes, regardless of whether it seems worth 10 minutes of
      my future time or not. The reason for the exception is that many
      of the most important things we know are things we&#39;re not sure
      are going to be important, but which our intuitions tell us
      matter. This doesn&#39;t mean we should memorize everything. But
      it&#39;s worth cultivating taste in what to memorize.
    </p>

    <p>
      The single biggest change that Anki brings about is that it
      means memory is no longer a haphazard event, to be left to
      chance. Rather, it guarantees I will remember something, with
      minimal effort. That is, <em>Anki makes memory a
      choice</em>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What can Anki be used for? I use Anki in all parts of my
      life. Professionally, I use it to learn from papers and books;
      to learn from talks and conferences; to help recall interesting
      things learned in conversation; and to remember key observations
      made while doing my everyday work. Personally, I use it to
      remember all kinds of facts relevant to my family and social
      life; about my city and travel; and about my hobbies. Later in
      the essay I describe some useful patterns of Anki use, and
      anti-patterns to avoid.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ve used Anki to create a little over 10,000 cards over about 2
      and a half years of regular use. That includes a 7-month break
      when I made very few new cards. When I&#39;m keeping up with my card
      review, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes per day. If it routinely
      rises to much more than 20 minutes it usually means I&#39;m adding
      cards too rapidly, and need to slow down. Alternately, it
      sometimes means I&#39;m behind on my card review (which I&#39;ll discuss
      later).
    </p>

    <p>
      At a practical level, I use the desktop Anki client for entering
      new cards, and the mobile client*<span>* The
      desktop client is free, but the mobile client is, at the time of
      writing, 25 dollars.  Many people balk at that as “too
      expensive”. Personally, I&#39;ve found the value is several
      orders of magnitude beyond 25 dollars. Mobile Anki is certainly
      far more valuable to me than a single meal in a moderately
      priced restaurant.</span> for reviewing. I review my Anki cards
      while walking to get my morning coffee, while waiting in line,
      on transit, and so on. Provided my mind is reasonably relaxed to
      begin with, I find the review experience meditative. If, on the
      other hand, my mind is not relaxed, I find review more
      difficult, and Anki can cause my mind to jump around more.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had trouble getting started with Anki. Several acquaintances
      highly recommended it (or similar systems), and over the years I
      made multiple attempts to use it, each time quickly giving
      up. In retrospect, there are substantial barriers to get over if
      you want to make it a habit.
    </p>

    <p>
      What made Anki finally “take” for me, turning it
      into a habit, was a project I took on as a joke. I&#39;d been
      frustrated for years at never really learning the Unix command
      line. I&#39;d only ever learned the most basic commands. Learning
      the command line is a superpower for people who program, so it
      seemed highly desirable to know well. So, for fun, I wondered if
      it might be possible to use Anki to essentially completely
      memorize a (short) book about the Unix command line.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was!
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose O&#39;Reilly Media&#39;s “Macintosh Terminal Pocket
      Guide”, by Daniel Barrett. I don&#39;t mean I literally
      memorized the entire text of the book*<span>*
      I later did an experiment with Charles Dickens&#39; “A Tale of
      Two Cities”, seeing if it might actually be possible to
      memorize the entire text. After a few weeks I concluded that it
      would be possible, but would not be worth the time. So I deleted
      all the cards. An interesting thing has occurred post-deletion:
      the first few sentences of the book have gradually decayed in my
      memory, and I now have no more than fragments.  I occasionally
      wonder what the impact would be of memorizing a good book in its
      entirety; I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it greatly influenced my
      own language and writing.</span>. But I did memorize much of the
      conceptual knowledge in the book, as well as the names, syntax,
      and options for most of the commands in the book. The exceptions
      were things I had no frame of reference to imagine using. But I
      did memorize most things I could imagine using. In the end I
      covered perhaps 60 to 70 percent of the book, skipping or
      skimming pieces that didn&#39;t seem relevant to me. Still, my
      knowledge of the command line increased enormously.

    <p>
      Choosing this rather ludicrous, albeit extremely useful, goal
      gave me a great deal of confidence in Anki. It was exciting,
      making it obvious that Anki would make it easy to learn things
      that would formerly have been quite tedious and difficult for me
      to learn.  This confidence, in turn, made it much easier to
      build an Anki habit. At the same time, the project also helped
      me learn the Anki interface, and got me to experiment with
      different ways of posing questions. That is, it helped me build
      the skills necessary to use Anki well.

    <h3>Using Anki to thoroughly read a research paper in an
    unfamiliar field</h3>

    <p>
      I find Anki a great help when reading research papers,
      particularly in fields outside my expertise. As an example of
      how this can work, I&#39;ll describe my experience reading a 2016
      paper*<span>* David Silver, Aja Huang, Chris

      Google DeepMind that beat some of the world&#39;s strongest players
      of the game Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the match where AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, one of the
      strongest human Go players in history, I suggested
      to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a>
      that I write an article about the
      system*<span>* Michael
      Nielsen, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/is-alphago-really-such-a-big-deal-20160329/">Is
      AlphaGo Really Such a Big Deal?</a>, Quanta
      (2016).</span>. AlphaGo was a hot media topic at the time, and
      the most common angle in stories was human interest, viewing
      AlphaGo as part of a long-standing human-versus-machine
      narrative, with a few technical details filled in, mostly as
      color.</p>

    <p>
      I wanted to take a different angle. Through the 1990s and first
      decade of the 2000s, I believed human-or-better general
      artificial intelligence was far, far away. The reason was that
      over that time researchers made only slow progress building
      systems to do intuitive pattern matching, of the kind that
      underlies human sight and hearing, as well as in playing games
      such as Go. Despite enormous effort by AI researchers, many
      pattern-matching feats which humans find effortless remained
      impossible for machines.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we made only very slow progress on this set of problems
      for a long time, around 2011 progress began to speed up, driven
      by advances in deep neural networks. For instance, machine
      vision systems rapidly went from being terrible to being
      comparable to human beings for certain limited tasks.  By the
      time AlphaGo was released, it was no longer correct to say we
      had no idea how to build computer systems to do intuitive
      pattern matching. While we hadn&#39;t yet nailed the problem, we
      were making rapid progress. AlphaGo was a big part of that
      story, and I wanted my article to explore this notion of
      building computer systems to capture human intuition.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I was excited, writing such an article was going to be
      difficult. It was going to require a deeper understanding of the
      technical details of AlphaGo than a typical journalistic
      article. Fortunately, I knew a fair amount about neural networks
      – I&#39;d written a book about them*<span>*
      Michael
      A. Nielsen, <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">&#34;Neural
      Networks and Deep Learning&#34;</a>, Determination Press
      (2015).</span>. But I knew nothing about the game of Go, or
      about many of the ideas used by AlphaGo, based on a field known
      as reinforcement learning. I was going to need to learn this
      material from scratch, and to write a good article I was going
      to need to really understand the underlying technical material.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here&#39;s how I went about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I began with the
      AlphaGo <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Silver2016a.pdf">paper</a> itself. I
      began reading it quickly, almost skimming. I wasn&#39;t looking for
      a comprehensive understanding. Rather, I was doing two
      things. One, I was trying to simply identify the most important
      ideas in the paper. What were the names of the key techniques
      I&#39;d need to learn about? Second, there was a kind of hoovering
      process, looking for basic facts that I could understand easily,
      and that would obviously benefit me. Things like basic
      terminology, the rules of Go, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here&#39;s a few examples of the kind of question I entered into
      Anki at this stage: “What&#39;s the size of a Go
      board?”; “Who plays first in Go?”; “How
      many human game positions did AlphaGo learn from?”;
      “Where did AlphaGo get its training data?”;
      “What were the names of the two main types of neural
      network AlphaGo used?”
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see, these are all elementary questions.  They&#39;re the
      kind of thing that are very easily picked up during an initial
      pass over the paper, with occasional digressions to search
      Google and Wikipedia, and so on. Furthermore, while these facts
      were easy to pick up in isolation, they also seemed likely to be
      useful in building a deeper understanding of other material in
      the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      I made several rapid passes over the paper in this way, each
      time getting deeper and deeper. At this stage I wasn&#39;t trying to
      obtain anything like a complete understanding of
      AlphaGo. Rather, I was trying to build up my background
      understanding.  At all times, if something wasn&#39;t easy to
      understand, I didn&#39;t worry about it, I just keep going. But as I
      made repeat passes, the range of things that were easy to
      understand grew and grew. I found myself adding questions about
      the types of features used as inputs to AlphaGo&#39;s neural
      networks, basic facts about the structure of the networks, and
      so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      After five or six such passes over the paper, I went back and
      attempted a thorough read. This time the purpose was to
      understand AlphaGo in detail.  By now I understood much of the
      background context, and it was relatively easy to do a thorough
      read, certainly far easier than coming into the paper
      cold. Don&#39;t get me wrong: it was still challenging. But it was
      far easier than it would have been otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      After doing one thorough pass over the AlphaGo paper, I made a
      second thorough pass, in a similar vein. Yet more fell into
      place. By this time, I understood the AlphaGo system reasonably
      well. Many of the questions I was putting into Anki were high
      level, sometimes on the verge of original research directions. I
      certainly understood AlphaGo well enough that I was confident I
      could write the sections of my article dealing with it. (In
      practice, my article ranged over several systems, not just
      AlphaGo, and I had to learn about those as well, using a similar
      process, though I didn&#39;t go as deep.) I continued to add
      questions as I wrote my article, ending up adding several
      hundred questions in total. But by this point the hardest work
      had been done.
    </p>


    <p>
      Of course, instead of using Anki I could have taken conventional
      notes, using a similar process to build up an understanding of
      the paper. But using Anki gave me confidence I would retain much
      of the understanding over the long term.  A year or so later
      DeepMind released papers describing followup systems, known as
      AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero*<span>* For
      AlphaGo Zero, see: David Silver, Julian Schrittwieser, Karen
      Simonyan, Ioannis Antonoglou <em>et
      al</em>, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Silver2017a.pdf">Mastering the game of
      Go without human knowledge</a>, Nature (2017). For AlphaZero,
      see: David Silver, Thomas Hubert, Julian Schrittwieser, Ioannis
      Antonoglou <em>et
      al</em>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815">Mastering
      Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement
      Learning Algorithm</a> (2017).</span>. Despite the fact that I&#39;d
      thought little about AlphaGo or reinforcement learning in the
      intervening time, I found I could read those followup papers
      with ease. While I didn&#39;t attempt to understand those papers as
      thoroughly as the initial AlphaGo paper, I found I could get a
      pretty good understanding of the papers in less than an
      hour. I&#39;d retained much of my earlier understanding!
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, had I used conventional note-taking in my original
      reading of the AlphaGo paper, my understanding would have more
      rapidly evaporated, and it would have taken longer to read the
      later papers. And so using Anki in this way gives confidence you
      will retain understanding over the long term. This confidence,
      in turn, makes the initial act of understanding more
      pleasurable, since you believe you&#39;re learning something for the
      long haul, not something you&#39;ll forget in a day or a week.
    </p>

    <p><span>OK, but what does one do with it?
    … [N]ow that I have all this power – a mechanical
    golem that will never forget and never let me forget whatever I
    chose to – what do I choose to remember?
    – <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Gwern
    Branwen</a>
    </span></p><p>
      This entire process took a few days of my time, spread over a
      few weeks. That&#39;s a lot of work. However, the payoff was that I
      got a pretty good basic grounding in modern deep reinforcement
      learning.  This is an immensely important field, of great use in
      robotics, and many researchers believe it will play an important
      role in achieving general artificial intelligence. With a few
      days work I&#39;d gone from knowing nothing about deep reinforcement
      learning to a durable understanding of a key paper in the field,
      a paper that made use of many techniques that were used across
      the entire field. Of course, I was still a long way from being
      an expert.  There were many important details about AlphaGo I
      hadn&#39;t understood, and I would have had to do far more work to
      build my own system in the area.  But this foundational kind of
      understanding is a good basis on which to build deeper
      expertise.
    </p>


      <p>
	It&#39;s notable that I was reading the AlphaGo paper in support
	of a creative project of my own, namely, writing an article
	for Quanta Magazine. This is important: I find Anki works much
	better when used in service to some personal creative project.
      </p>

      <p>
	It&#39;s tempting instead to use Anki to stockpile knowledge
	against some future day, to think “Oh, I should learn
	about the geography of Africa, or learn about World War II, or
	[…]”. These are goals which, for me, are
	intellectually appealing, but which I&#39;m not emotionally
	invested in.  I&#39;ve tried this a bunch of times. It tends to
	generate cold and lifeless Anki questions, questions which I
	find hard to connect to upon later review, and where it&#39;s
	difficult to really, deeply internalize the answers. The
	problem is somehow in that initial idea I “should”
	learn about these things: intellectually, it seems like a good
	idea, but I&#39;ve little emotional commitment.

      <p><span>Study hard what interests you the most
      in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner

      </span></p><p>
	By contrast, when I&#39;m reading in support of some creative
	project, I ask much better Anki questions.  I find it easier
	to connect to the questions and answers emotionally. I simply
	care more about them, and that makes a difference.  So while
	it&#39;s tempting to use Anki cards to study in preparation for
	some (possibly hypothetical) future use, it&#39;s better to find a
	way to use Anki as part of some creative project.
      </p>
      
	
    <h3>Using Anki to do shallow reads of papers</h3>
    
    <p>
      Most of my Anki-based reading is much shallower than my read of
      the AlphaGo paper. Rather than spending days on a paper, I&#39;ll
      typically spend 10 to 60 minutes, sometimes longer for very good
      papers. Here&#39;s a few notes on some patterns I&#39;ve found useful in
      shallow reading.
    </p>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, I&#39;m usually doing such reading as part of
      the background research for some project. I will find a new
      article (or set of articles), and typically spend a few minutes
      assessing it. Does the article seem likely to contain
      substantial insight or provocation relevant to my project
      – new questions, new ideas, new methods, new results?  If
      so, I&#39;ll have a read.
    </p>

    <p>
      This doesn&#39;t mean reading every word in the paper. Rather, I&#39;ll
      add to Anki questions about the core claims, core questions, and
      core ideas of the paper. It&#39;s particularly helpful to extract
      Anki questions from the abstract, introduction, conclusion,
      figures, and figure captions. Typically I will extract anywhere
      from 5 to 20 Anki questions from the paper. It&#39;s usually a bad
      idea to extract fewer than 5 questions – doing so tends to
      leave the paper as a kind of isolated orphan in my memory.
      Later I find it difficult to feel much connection to those
      questions. Put another way: if a paper is so uninteresting that
      it&#39;s not possible to add 5 good questions about it, it&#39;s usually
      better to add no questions at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      One failure mode of this process is if you
      Ankify*<span>* I.e., enter into Anki. Also
      useful are forms such as Ankification <em>etc</em>.</span>
      misleading work. Many papers contain wrong or misleading
      statements, and if you commit such items to memory, you&#39;re
      actively making yourself stupider.
    </p>

    <p>
      How to avoid Ankifying misleading work?
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, let me describe how I Ankified a paper I recently
      read, by the economists Benjamin Jones and Bruce
      Weinberg*<span>* Benjamin F. Jones and Bruce
      A. Weinberg, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Jones2011a.pdf">Age Dynamics in
      Scientific Creativity</a>, Proceedings of the National Academy
      of Sciences (2011).</span>. The paper studies the ages at which
      scientists make their greatest discoveries.
    </p>

      <p>
	I should say at the outset: I have no reason to think this
      paper is misleading! But it&#39;s also worth being cautious.  As an
      example of that caution, one of the questions I added to Anki
      was: “What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at
      which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over
      1980-2011?” (Answer: 48).  Another variant question was:
      “Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their
      prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period
      1980-2011?” (Answer: Jones 2011).  And so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such questions qualify the underlying claim: we now know it was
      a claim made in Jones 2011, and that we&#39;re relying on the
      quality of Jones and Weinberg&#39;s data analysis. In fact, I
      haven&#39;t examined that analysis carefully enough to regard it as
      a fact that the average age of those Nobelists is 48. But it is
      certainly a fact that their paper claimed it was 48. Those are
      different things, and the latter is better to Ankify.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I&#39;m particularly concerned about the quality of the analysis,
      I may add one or more questions about what makes such work
      difficult, e.g.: “What&#39;s one challenge in determining the
      age of Nobel winners at the time of their discovery, as
      discussed in Jones 2011?” Good answers include: the
      difficulty of figuring out which paper contained the
      Nobel-winning work; the fact that publication of papers is
      sometimes delayed by years; that sometimes work is spread over
      multiple papers; and so on. Thinking about such challenges
      reminds me that if Jones and Weinberg were sloppy, or simply
      made an understandable mistake, their numbers might be off.
      Now, it so happens that for this particular paper, I&#39;m not too
      worried about such issues. And so I didn&#39;t Ankify any such
      question.  But it&#39;s worth being careful in framing questions so
      you&#39;re not misleading yourself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Another useful pattern while reading papers is Ankifying
      figures. For instance, here&#39;s a graph from Jones 2011 showing
      the probability a physicist made their prizewinning discovery by
      age 40 (blue line) and by age 30 (black line):
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Jones_figure2011a.png"/>
    </center>
    
    <p>
      I have an Anki question which simply says: “Visualize the
      graph Jones 2011 made of the probability curves for physicists
      making their prizewinning discoveries by age 30 and
      40”. The answer is the image shown above, and I count
      myself as successful if my mental image is roughly along those
      lines. I could deepen my engagement with the graph by adding
      questions such as: “In Jones 2011&#39;s graph of physics
      prizewinning discoveries, what is the peak probability of great
      achievement by age 40 [i.e., the highest point in the blue line
      in the graph above]?” (Answer: about 0.8.)  Indeed, one
      could easily add dozens of interesting questions about this
      graph. I haven&#39;t done that, because of the time commitment
      associated to such questions. But I do find the broad shape of
      the graph fascinating, and it&#39;s also useful to know the graph
      exists, and where to consult it if I want more details.
    </p>

    <p>
      I said above that I typically spend 10 to 60 minutes Ankifying a
      paper, with the duration depending on my judgment of the value
      I&#39;m getting from the paper. However, if I&#39;m learning a great
      deal, and finding it interesting, I keep reading and
      Ankifying. Really good resources are worth investing time
      in. But most papers don&#39;t fit this pattern, and you quickly
      saturate. If you feel you could easily find something more
      rewarding to read, switch over. It&#39;s worth deliberately
      practicing such switches, to avoid building a counter-productive
      habit of completionism in your reading. It&#39;s nearly always
      possible to read deeper into a paper, but that doesn&#39;t mean you
      can&#39;t easily be getting more value elsewhere.  It&#39;s a failure
      mode to spend too long reading unimportant papers.
    </p>

    

    <h3>Syntopic reading using Anki</h3>
    
      <p>
	I&#39;ve talked about how to use Anki to do shallow reads of
	papers, and rather deeper reads of papers. There&#39;s also a
	sense in which it&#39;s possible to use Anki not just to read
	papers, but to “read” the entire research
	literature of some field or subfield.  Here&#39;s how to do it.
      </p>

      <p>
	You might suppose the foundation would be a shallow read of a
	large number of papers. In fact, to really grok an unfamiliar
	field, you need to engage deeply with key papers –
	papers like the AlphaGo paper. What you get from deep
	engagement with important papers is more significant than any
	single fact or technique: you get a sense for what a powerful
	result in the field looks like. It helps you imbibe the
	healthiest norms and standards of the field. It helps you
	internalize how to ask good questions in the field, and how to
	put techniques together. You begin to understand what made
	something like AlphaGo a breakthrough – and also its
	limitations, and the sense in which it was really a natural
	evolution of the field. Such things aren&#39;t captured
	individually by any single Anki question. But they begin to be
	captured collectively by the questions one asks when engaged
	deeply enough with key papers.
      </p>

      <p>
	So, to get a picture of an entire field, I usually begin with
	a truly important paper, ideally a paper establishing a result
	that got me interested in the field in the first place. I do a
	thorough read of that paper, along the lines of what I
	described for AlphaGo. Later, I do thorough reads of other key
	papers in the field – ideally, I read the best 5-10
	papers in the field. But, interspersed, I also do shallower
	reads of a much larger number of less important (though still
	good) papers. In my experimentation so far that means tens of
	papers, though I expect in some fields I will eventually read
	hundreds or even thousands of papers in this way.
      </p>

      <p>
	You may wonder why I don&#39;t just focus on only the most
	important papers. Part of the reason is mundane: it can be
	hard to tell what the most important papers are. Shallow reads
	of many papers can help you figure out what the key papers
	are, without spending too much time doing deeper reads of
	papers that turn out not to be so important. But there&#39;s also
	a culture that one imbibes reading the bread-and-butter papers
	of a field: a sense for what routine progress looks like, for
	the praxis of the field. That&#39;s valuable too, especially for
	building up an overall picture of where the field is at, and
	to stimulate questions on my own part. Indeed, while I don&#39;t
	recommend spending a large fraction of your time reading bad
	papers, it&#39;s certainly possible to have a good conversation
	with a bad paper. Stimulus is found in unexpected places.
      </p>

      <p>
	Over time, this is a form of what Mortimer Adler and Charles
	van Doren dubbed <em>syntopic
	reading</em>*<span>* In their marvelous
	“How to Read a Book”: Mortimer J. Adler and
	Charles van Doren, “How to Read a Book: The Classic
	Guide to Intelligent Reading” (1972)</span>. I build up
	an understanding of an entire literature: what&#39;s been done,
	what&#39;s not yet been done. Of course, it&#39;s not literally
	reading an entire literature. But functionally it&#39;s close.  I
	start to identify open problems, questions that I&#39;d personally
	like answered, but which don&#39;t yet seem to have been
	answered. I identify tricks, observations that seem pregnant
	with possibility, but whose import I don&#39;t yet know. And,
	sometimes, I identify what seem to me to be field-wide blind
	spots. I add questions about all these to Anki as well. In
	this way, Anki is a medium supporting my creative research. It
	has some shortcomings as such a medium, since it&#39;s not
	designed with supporting creative work in mind – it&#39;s
	not, for instance, equipped for lengthy, free-form exploration
	inside a scratch space. But even without being designed in
	such a way, it&#39;s helpful as a creative support.
      </p>
      
    <p>
      I&#39;ve been describing how I use Anki to learn fields which are
      largely new to me.  By contrast, with a field I already know
      well, my curiosity and my model of the field are often already
      so strong that it&#39;s easy to integrate new facts. I still find
      Anki useful, but it&#39;s definitely most useful in new areas.  The
      great English mathematician John Edensor Littlewood
      wrote*<span>* In “Littlewood&#39;s
      miscellany”, edited by Béla Bollobás (1986).</span>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      I have tried to learn mathematics outside my fields of interest;
      after any interval I had to begin all over again.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This captures something of the immense emotional effort I used
      to find required to learn a new field. Without a lot of drive,
      it was extremely difficult to make a lot of material in a new
      field stick. Anki does much to solve that problem. In a sense,
      it&#39;s an emotional prosthetic, actually helping create the drive
      I need to achieve understanding. It doesn&#39;t do the entire job
      – as mentioned earlier, it&#39;s very helpful to have other
      commitments (like a creative project, or people depending on me)
      to help create that drive.  Nonetheless, Anki helps give me
      confidence that I can simply <em>decide</em> I&#39;m going to read
      deeply into a new field, and retain and make sense of much of
      what I learn. This has worked for all areas of conceptual
      understanding where I&#39;ve tried it*<span>* I&#39;m
      curious how well it could be used for motor skills and problem
      solving, two areas where I haven&#39;t tried using Anki.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One surprising consequence of reading in this way is how much
      more enjoyable it becomes. I&#39;ve always enjoyed reading, but
      starting out in a challenging new field was sometimes a real
      slog, and I was often bedeviled by doubts that I would ever
      really get into the field. That doubt, in turn, made it less
      likely that I would succeed. Now I have confidence that I can go
      into a new field and quickly attain a good, relatively deep
      understanding, an understanding that will be durable. That
      confidence makes reading even more
      pleasurable*<span>* Many people have written
      accounts of how to read using personal memory systems. My
      thinking was particularly stimulated by: Piotr
      Wozniak, <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm">Incremental
      Reading</a>.</span>.
    </p>


    <h3>More patterns of Anki use</h3>


    <p>
      Having looked at the use of Anki for reading technical papers,
      let&#39;s return to general patterns of
      use*<span>* Another useful list of patterns
      is: Piotr
      Wozniak, <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules">Effective
      learning: Twenty rules of formulating
      knowledge</a>.</span>. There&#39;s a lot in this section, and upon a
      first read you may wish to skim through and concentrate on those
      items which most catch your eye.
    </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as
	  possible:</strong> That is, both the question and answer
	  express just one idea. As an example, when I was learning
	  the Unix command line, I entered the question: “How to
	  create a soft link from <code>linkname</code>
	  to <code>filename</code>?” The answer was:
	  “<code>ln -s filename
	  linkname</code>”. Unfortunately, I routinely got this
	  question wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solution was to refactor the question by breaking it into
      two pieces. One piece was: “What&#39;s the basic command and
      option to create a Unix soft link?” Answer:
      “<code>ln -s …</code>”. And the second piece
      was: “When creating a Unix soft link, in what order
      do <code>linkname</code> and
      <code>filename</code> go?” Answer: “<code>filename
	linkname</code>”.
    </p>

    <p>
      Breaking this question into more atomic pieces turned a question
      I routinely got wrong into two questions I routinely got
      right*<span>* An even more atomic version
      would be to break the first question into “What&#39;s the Unix
      command to create a link?” and “What&#39;s the option to
      the <code>ln</code> command to create a soft link?” In
      practice, I&#39;ve known for years that <code>ln</code> is the
      command to create a link, and so this wasn&#39;t
      necessary.</span>. Most of all: when I wanted to create a Unix
      soft link in practice, I knew how to do it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s responsible for this effect. I suspect it&#39;s
      partly about focus.  When I made mistakes with the combined
      question, I was often a little fuzzy about where exactly my
      mistake was. That meant I didn&#39;t focus sharply enough on the
      mistake, and so didn&#39;t learn as much from my failure. When I
      fail with the atomic questions my mind knows exactly where to
      focus.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, I find that you often get substantial benefit from
      breaking Anki questions down to be more atomic. It&#39;s a powerful
      pattern for question refactoring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t also retain some
      version of the original question. I still want to know how to
      create a soft link in Unix, and so it&#39;s worth keeping the
      original question in Anki. But it becomes an integrative
      question, part of a hierarchy of questions building up from
      simple atomic facts to more complex ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Incidentally, just because a question is atomic doesn&#39;t mean it
      can&#39;t involve quite complex, high-level concepts. Consider the
      following question, from the field of general relativity:
      “What is the <em>dr<sup>2</sup></em> term in the
      Robertson-Walker metric?” Answer:
      <em>dr<sup>2</sup>/(1-kr^2)</em>. Now, unless you&#39;ve studied
      general relativity that question probably seems quite
      opaque. It&#39;s a sophisticated, integrative question, assuming you
      know what the Robertson-Walker metric is,
      what <em>dr<sup>2</sup></em> means, what
      <em>k</em> means, and so on. But conditional on that background
      knowledge, it&#39;s quite an atomic question and answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      One benefit of using Anki in this way is that you begin to
      habitually break things down into atomic questions. This sharply
      crystallizes the distinct things you&#39;ve learned. Personally, I
      find that crystallization satisfying, for reasons I (ironically)
      find difficult to articulate. But one real benefit is that later
      I often find those atomic ideas can be put together in ways I
      didn&#39;t initially anticipate. And that&#39;s well worth the trouble.
    </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Anki use is best thought of as a virtuoso skill, to be
	  developed:</strong> Anki is an extremely simple program: it
	  lets you enter text or other media, and then shows you that
	  media on a schedule determined by your responses. Despite
	  that simplicity, it&#39;s an incredibly powerful tool. And, like
	  many tools, it requires skill to use well. It&#39;s worth
	  thinking of Anki as a skill that can be developed to
	  virtuoso levels, and attempting to continue to level up
	  toward such virtuosity.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<strong>Anki isn&#39;t just a tool for memorizing simple facts.
	  It&#39;s a tool for understanding almost anything.</strong> It&#39;s
	  a common misconception that Anki is just for memorizing
	  simple raw facts, things like vocabulary items and basic
	  definitions. But as we&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s possible to use Anki
	  for much more advanced types of understanding. My questions
	  about AlphaGo began with simple questions such as “How
	  large is a Go board?”, and ended with high-level
	  conceptual questions about the design of the AlphaGo systems
	  – on subjects such as how AlphaGo avoided
	  over-generalizing from training data, the limitations of
	  convolutional neural networks, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
	Part of developing Anki as a virtuoso skill is cultivating the
	ability to use it for types of understanding beyond basic
	facts. Indeed, many of the observations I&#39;ve made (and will
	make, below) about how to use Anki are really about what it
	means to understand something. Break things up into atomic
	facts. Build rich hierarchies of interconnections and
	integrative questions. Don&#39;t put in orphan questions. Patterns
	for how to engage with reading material. Patterns (and
	anti-patterns) for question types. Patterns for the kinds of
	things you&#39;d like to memorize. Anki skills concretely
	instantiate your theory of how you understand; developing
	those skills will help you understand better. It&#39;s too strong
	to say that to be a virtuoso Anki user is to be a virtuoso in
	understanding. But there&#39;s some truth to it.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Use one big deck:</strong> Anki allows you to organize
      cards into decks and subdecks. Some people use this to create a
      complicated organizational structure. I used to do this, but
      I&#39;ve gradually*<span>* It&#39;s gradual because
      questions sometimes need to be rewritten due to the changed
      context. For instance, both my Emacs and Unix command line decks
      had very similar questions, along the lines of: “How to
      delete a word?” Those questions need to be rewritten,
      e.g. as: “In Emacs, how to delete a word?” (This, by
      the way, may seem a strange question for a long-time Emacs user
      such as myself. In fact, I&#39;ve used Anki to help me change the
      way I delete words in Emacs, which is why I have an Anki
      question on the subject. I have made many improvements to my
      Emacs workflow this way.)</span>  merged my decks and subdecks
      into one big deck. The world isn&#39;t divided up into neatly
      separated components, and I believe it&#39;s good to collide very
      different types of questions. One moment Anki is asking me a
      question about the temperature chicken should be cooked to. The
      next: a question about the JavaScript API. Is this mixing doing
      me any real good? I&#39;m not sure. I have not, as yet, found any
      reason to use JavaScript to control the cooking of a
      chicken. But I don&#39;t think this mixing does any harm, and hope
      it is creatively stimulating, and helps me apply my knowledge in
      unusual contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Avoid orphan questions:</strong> Suppose I&#39;m reading
      online and stumble across a great article about the grooming
      habits of the Albanian giant mongoose, a subject I never
      previously knew I was interested in, but which turns out to be
      fascinating. Pretty soon I&#39;ve Ankified 5 to 10 questions. That&#39;s
      great, but my experience suggests that in a few months I&#39;ll
      likely find those questions rather stale, and frequently get
      them wrong. I believe the reason is that those questions are too
      disconnected from my other interests, and I will have lost the
      context that made me interested.
    </p>

    <p>
      I call these <em>orphan questions</em>, because they&#39;re not
      closely related to anything else in my memory. It&#39;s not bad to
      have a few orphan questions in Anki – it can be difficult
      to know what will turn out to be of only passing interest, and
      what will grow into a substantial interest, connected to my
      other interests. But if a substantial minority of your questions
      are orphans, that&#39;s a sign you should concentrate more on
      Ankifying questions related to your main creative projects, and
      cut down on Ankifying tangential material.
    </p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s particularly worth avoiding lonely orphans: single
      questions that are largely disconnected from everything
      else. Suppose, for instance, I&#39;m reading an article on a new
      subject, and I learn an idea that seems particularly useful. I
      make it a rule to never put in one question. Rather, I try to
      put at least two questions in, preferably three or more. That&#39;s
      usually enough that it&#39;s at least the nucleus of a bit of useful
      knowledge. If it&#39;s a lonely orphan, inevitably I get the
      question wrong all the time, and it&#39;s a waste to have entered it
      at all.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      <strong>Don&#39;t share decks:</strong> I&#39;m often asked whether I&#39;d
      be willing to share my Anki decks. I&#39;m not. Very early on I
      realized it would be very useful to put personal information in
      Anki. I don&#39;t mean anything terribly personal – I&#39;d never
      put deep, dark secrets in there. Nor do I put anything requiring
      security, like passwords. But I do put some things I wouldn&#39;t
      sling about casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, I&#39;ve a (very short!) list of superficially
      charming and impressive colleagues who I would never work with,
      because I&#39;ve consistently seen them treat other people
      badly. It&#39;s helpful to Ankify some details of that treatment, so
      I can clearly remember why that person should be avoided. This
      isn&#39;t the kind of information that is right to spread casually:
      I may have misinterpreted the other person&#39;s actions, or have
      misunderstood the context they were operating in. But it&#39;s
      personally useful for me to have in Anki.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Construct your own decks:</strong> The Anki site
      has <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">many shared
      decks</a>, but I&#39;ve found only a little use for them. The most
      important reason is that making Anki cards is an act of
      understanding in itself.  That is, figuring out good questions
      to ask, and good answers, is part of what it means to understand
      a new subject well. To use someone else&#39;s cards is to forgo much
      of that understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, I believe the act of constructing the cards actually
      helps with memory. Memory researchers have repeatedly found that
      the more elaborately you encode a memory, the stronger the
      memory will be. By elaborative encoding, they mean essentially
      the richness of the associations you form.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, it&#39;s possible to try to remember as an isolated
      fact that 1962 was the year the first telecommunications
      satellite, Telstar, was put into orbit. But a better way of
      remembering it is to relate that fact to others. Relatively
      prosaically, you might observe that Telstar was launched just 5
      years after the first Soviet satellite, Sputnik. It didn&#39;t take
      long to put space to use for telecommunications.  Less
      prosaically – a richer elaboration – I personally
      find it fascinating that Telstar was put into orbit the
      year <em>before</em> the introduction of ASCII, arguably the
      first modern digital standard for communicating text. Humanity
      had a telecommunications satellite before we had a digital
      standard for communicating text! Finding that kind of connection
      is an example of an elaborative encoding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The act of constructing an Anki card is itself nearly always a
      form of elaborative encoding. It forces you to think through
      alternate forms of the question, to consider the best possible
      answers, and so on. I believe this is true for even the most
      elementary cards. And it certainly becomes true if you construct
      more complex cards, cards relating the basic fact to be
      remembered to other ideas (like the Telstar-ASCII link),
      gradually building up a web of richly interrelated ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that said, there are some valuable deck-sharing
      practices. For instance, there are communities of medical
      students who find value in sharing and sometimes collaboratively
      constructing decks*<span>* See
      the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">MedicalSchoolAnki
      subreddit</a>, which contains frequent discussion of the best
      decks, how to use them, as well as an ever-changing canon of
      best decks to use for different purposes. See also the paper:
      Michael Hart-Matyas <em>et
      al</em>, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Hart-Matyas2018.pdf">Twelve tips for
      medical students to establish a collaborative flashcard
      project</a>, Medical Teacher (2018).</span>. I&#39;ve also found
      value in shared decks containing very elementary questions, such
      as <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/685421036">art
      decks</a> which ask questions such as who painted a particular
      painting. But for deeper kinds of understanding, I&#39;ve not yet
      found good ways of using shared decks.
    </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Cultivate strategies for elaborative encoding /
	forming rich associations:</strong> This is really a
	meta-strategy, i.e., a strategy for forming strategies. One
	simple example strategy is to <em>use multiple variants of the
	“same” question</em>.  For instance, I mentioned
	earlier my two questions: “What does Jones 2011 claim is
	the average age at which physics Nobelists made their
	prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?” And:
	“Which paper claimed that physics Nobelists made their
	prizewinning discovery at average age 48, over the period
	1980-2011?” Logically, these two questions are obviously
	closely related. But in terms of how memory works, they are
	different, causing associations on very different triggers.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>What about memory palaces and similar
	techniques?</strong> There is a well-known set of memory
	techniques based around ideas such as memory palaces, the
	method of loci, and others*<span>* An
	entertaining and informative overview is: Joshua Foer,
	“Moonwalking with Einstein” (2011).</span>. This
	is an extreme form of elaborative encoding, making rich visual
	and spatial associations to the material you want to
	remember. Here&#39;s Joshua Foer recounting a conversation where
	mnemonist Ed Cooke describes one basic technique:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	Ed then explained to me his procedure for making a name
	memorable, which he had used in the competition to memorize
	the first and last names associated with ninety-nine different
	photographic head shots in the names-and-faces event. It was a
	technique he promised I could use to remember people&#39;s names
	at parties and meetings. “The trick is actually
	deceptively simple,” he said. “It is always to
	associate the sound of a person&#39;s name with something you can
	clearly imagine. It&#39;s all about creating a vivid image in your
	mind that anchors your visual memory of the person&#39;s face to a
	visual memory connected to the person&#39;s name. When you need to
	reach back and remember the person&#39;s name at some later date,
	the image you created will simply pop back into your
	mind… So, hmm, you said your name was Josh Foer,
	eh?” He raised an eyebrow and gave his chin a
	melodramatic stroke. “Well, I&#39;d imagine you joshing me
	where we first met, outside the competition hall, and I&#39;d
	imagine myself breaking into four pieces in
	response. Four/Foer, get it? That little image is more
	entertaining—to me, at least—than your mere name, and should
	stick nicely in the mind.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	I&#39;ve experimented with these techniques, and while they&#39;re
	fun, they seem most useful for memorizing trivia –
	sequences of playing cards, strings of digits, and so on. They
	seem less well developed for more abstract concepts, and such
	abstractions are often where the deepest understanding
	lies. In that sense, they may even distract from
	understanding. That said, it&#39;s possible I simply need to
	figure out better ways of using these ideas, much as I needed
	to figure out Anki. In particular, it may be worth further
	investigating some of the techniques used by practitioners to
	form rich associations. As Foer says, quoting a memory expert,
	there is great value in learning to “think in more
	memorable ways”.
      </p>
	
    <p>
      <strong>95% of Anki&#39;s value comes from 5% of the
      features:</strong> Anki has ways of auto-generating cards, of
      tagging cards, a plugin ecosystem, and much else. In practice, I
      rarely use any of these features. My cards are always one of two
      types: the majority are simple question and answer; a
      substantial minority are what&#39;s called a <em>cloze</em>: a kind
      of fill-in-the-blanks test. For instance, I&#39;ll use clozes to
      test myself on favorite quotes:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “if the personal computer is truly a __ then the use of it
      would actually change the __ of an __&#34;, __, __” (Answer:
      new medium, thought patterns, entire civilization, Alan Kay,
      1989).
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Clozes can also be used to pose questions not involving quotes:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      The Adelson illusion is also known as the ___ illusion. (Answer:
      checker-shadow)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Why not use more of Anki&#39;s features? Part of the reason is that
      I get an enormous benefit from just the core features.
      Furthermore, learning to use this tiny set of features well has
      required a lot of work. A basketball and hoop are simple pieces
      of equipment, but you can spend a lifetime learning to use them
      well. Similarly, basic Anki practice can be developed
      enormously. And so I&#39;ve concentrated on learning to use those
      basic features well.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know many people who try Anki out, and then go down a rabbit
      hole learning as many features as possible so they can use it
      “efficiently”. Usually, they&#39;re chasing 1%
      improvements. Often, those people ultimately give up Anki as
      “too difficult”, which is often a synonym for
      “I got nervous I wasn&#39;t using it perfectly”. This is
      a pity. As discussed earlier, Anki offers something like a
      20-fold improvement over (say) ordinary flashcards. And so
      they&#39;re giving up a 2,000% improvement because they were worried
      they were missing a few final 5%, 1% and (in many cases) 0.1%
      improvements. This kind of rabbit hole seems to be especially
      attractive to programmers.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, when someone is getting started I advise not
      using any advanced features, and not installing any
      plugins. Don&#39;t, in short, come down with a bad case of
      programmer&#39;s efficiency disease. Learn how to use Anki for basic
      question and answer, and concentrate on exploring new patterns
      within that paradigm. That&#39;ll serve you far better than any
      number of hours spent fiddling around with the features. Then,
      if you build a regular habit of high-quality Anki use, you can
      experiment with more advanced features.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The challenges of using Anki to store facts about
      friends and family:</strong> I&#39;ve experimented with using Anki
      to store (non-sensitive!) questions about friends and family. It
      works well for things like “Is [my friend] a vegan?”
      But my use has run somewhat aground on thornier questions. For
      instance, suppose I talk with a new friend about their kids, but
      have never met those kids. I could put in questions like
      “What is the name of [my friend&#39;s] eldest child?”
      Or, if we&#39;d chatted about music, I might put in: “What is
      a musician [my friend] likes?”
    </p>

    <p>
      This kind of experiment is well intentioned. But posing such
      questions often leaves me feeling uncomfortable. It seems too
      much like faking interest in my friends. There&#39;s a pretty strong
      social norm that if you remember your friends&#39; taste in music or
      their kids&#39; names, it&#39;s because you&#39;re interested in that
      friend. Using a memory aid feels somehow ungenuine, at least to
      me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ve talked with several friends about this. Most have told me
      the same thing: they appreciate me going to so much trouble in
      the first place, and find it charming that I&#39;d worry so much
      about whether it was ungenuine. So perhaps it&#39;s a mistake to
      worry.  Nonetheless, I still have trouble with it. I have
      adopted Anki for less personal stuff – things like
      people&#39;s food preferences. And maybe over time I&#39;ll use it for
      storing more personal facts. But for now I&#39;m taking it slow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Procedural versus declarative memory:</strong> There&#39;s a
      big difference between remembering a fact and mastering a
      process.  For instance, while you might remember a Unix command
      when cued by an Anki question, that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll
      recognize an opportunity to use the command in the context of
      the command line, and be comfortable typing it out. And it&#39;s
      still another thing to find novel, creative ways of combining
      the commands you know, in order to solve challenging problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Put another way: to really internalize a process, it&#39;s not
      enough just to review Anki cards. You need to carry out the
      process, in context. And you need to solve real problems with
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that said, I&#39;ve found the transfer process relatively
      easy. In the case of the command line, I use it often enough
      that I have plenty of opportunities to make real use of my
      Ankified knowledge of the command line. Over time, that
      declarative knowledge is becoming procedural knowledge I
      routinely use in context. That said, it&#39;d be good to better
      understand when the transfer works and when it doesn&#39;t. Even
      better would be a memory system that integrates into my actual
      working environment. For instance, it could query me on Unix
      commands, while placing me at an actual command line. Or perhaps
      it would ask me to solve higher-level problems, while at the
      command line.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ve tried one experiment in this vein: miming the action of
      typing commands while I review my Anki cards. But my subjective
      impression was that it doesn&#39;t work so well, and it was also
      quite annoying to do. So I stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Getting past “names don&#39;t matter”:</strong>
      I&#39;m a theoretical physicist by training. There is a famous story
      in physics, told by Richard Feynman, dismissing the value of
      knowing the names of things. As a child, Feynman was out playing
      in a field with a know-it-all kid. Here&#39;s what happened, in
      Feynman&#39;s telling*<span>* Richard P. Feynman,
      “What Do You Care What Other People Think? Further
      Adventures of a Curious Character” (1989).</span>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
	One kid says to me, “See that bird?  What kind of bird is
	that?”

	<p>I said, “I haven&#39;t the slightest idea what kind
	of a bird it is.”

	</p><p>He says, “It&#39;a brown-throated thrush. Your
	father doesn&#39;t teach you anything!”

	</p><p>But it was the opposite. He [Feynman&#39;s father] had
	already taught me: “See that bird?” he
	says. “It&#39;s a Spencer&#39;s warbler.” (I knew he
	didn&#39;t know the real name.)  “Well, in Italian, it&#39;s
	a <em>Chutto Lapittida</em>. In Portuguese, it&#39;s a <em>Bom da
	Peida</em>… You can know the name of that bird in all
	the languages of the world, but when you&#39;re finished, you&#39;ll
	know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird! You&#39;ll only
	know about humans in different places, and what they call the
	bird. So let&#39;s look at the bird and see what
	it&#39;s <em>doing</em> — that&#39;s what counts.” (I
	learned very early the difference between knowing the name of
	something and knowing something.)
    </p></blockquote>

    <p>
      Feynman (or his father) goes on to a thoughtful discussion of
      real knowledge: observing behavior, understanding the reasons
      for it, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s a good story. But it goes too far: names do matter. Maybe
      not as much as the know-it-all kid thought, and they&#39;re not
      usually a deep kind of knowledge. But they&#39;re the foundation
      that allows you to build up a network of knowledge.
    </p>

      <p>
	This trope that names don&#39;t matter was repeatedly drilled into
	me during my scientific training. When I began using Anki, at
	first I felt somewhat silly putting questions about names for
	things into the system. But now I do it enthusiastically,
	knowing that it&#39;s an early step along the way to
	understanding.
      </p>

    <p>
      Anki is useful for names of all kinds of things, but I find it
      particularly helpful for non-verbal things. For instance, I put
      in questions about artworks, like: “What does the artist
      <a href="https://www.emilyhare.co.uk/">Emily Hare&#39;s</a> painting
      <em>Howl</em> look like?” Answer:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/EmilyHareHowl.png"/>
    </center>

    <p>
      I put that question in for two reasons. The main reason is that
      I like to remember the experience of the painting from time to
      time. And the other is to put a name to the
      painting*<span>* Actually, a better question
      for that is to be shown the painting and asked what its name
      is.</span>. If I wanted to think more analytically about the
      painting – say, about the clever use of color gradients
      – I could add more detailed questions. But I&#39;m pretty
      happy just committing the experience of the image to memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>What do you do when you get behind?</strong> Anki
      becomes challenging when you get behind with cards. If you skip
      a day or two – or fifty – the cards begin to back
      up. It&#39;s intimidating to come back to find you have 500 cards to
      review in a day. Even worse, if you fall out of the Anki habit,
      you can get a very long way behind. I largely stopped using Anki
      for a 7-month period, and came back to thousands of backlogged
      cards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t that hard to catch up. I set myself
      gradually increasing quotas (100, 150, 200, 250, and eventually
      300) of cards per day, and worked through those quotas each day
      for several weeks until I&#39;d caught up.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this wasn&#39;t too difficult, it was somewhat demoralizing
      and discouraging. It&#39;d be better if Anki had a “catch
      up” feature that would spread the excess cards over the
      next few weeks in your schedule. But it doesn&#39;t. In any case,
      this is a gotcha, but it&#39;s not too difficult to address.
    </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Using Anki for APIs, books, videos, seminars,
	  conversations, the web, events, and places:</strong> Nearly
	  everything I said earlier about Ankifying papers applies
	  also to other resources. Here&#39;s a few tips. I&#39;ve separated
	  out the discussion for APIs into an appendix, which you can
	  <a href="#Anki_APIs">read below</a>, if interested.
      </p>

      <p>
	For seminars and conversations with colleagues I find it
	surprisingly helpful to set Anki quotas. For instance, for
	seminars I try to find at least three high-quality questions
	to Ankify. For extended conversations, at least one
	high-quality question to Ankify. I&#39;ve found that setting
	quotas helps me pay more attention, especially during
	seminars. (I find it much easier <em>a priori</em> to pay
	attention in one-on-one conversation.)
      </p>

      <p>
	I&#39;m more haphazard about videos, events, and places. It&#39;d be
	good to, say, systematically Ankify 3-5 questions after going
	on an outing or to a new restaurant, to help me remember the
	experience. I do this sometimes. But I haven&#39;t been that
	systematic.
      </p>

      <p>
	I tend to Ankify in real time as I read papers and books. For
	seminars, conversations, and so on I prefer to immerse myself
	in the experience. Instead of getting out Anki, I will quickly
	make a mental (or paper) note of what I want to Ankify. I then
	enter it into Anki later. This requires some discipline; it&#39;s
	one reason I prefer to set a small quota, so that I merely
	have to enter a few questions later, rather than dozens.
      </p>
	
      <p>
	One caution is with books: reading an entire book is a big
	commitment, and adding Anki questions regularly can slow you
	down a lot. It&#39;s worth keeping this in mind when deciding how
	much to Ankify. Sometimes a book is so dense with great
	material that it&#39;s worth taking the time to add lots of
	questions. But unmindfully Ankifying everything in sight is a
	bad habit, one I&#39;ve occasionally fallen into.
      </p>

      <p>
	What you Ankify is not a trivial choice: Ankify things that
	serve your long-term goals. In some measure we become what we
	remember, so we must be careful what we
	remember*<span>* With apologies to Kurt
	Vonnegut, who wrote: “We are what we pretend to be, so
	we must be careful about what we pretend to
	be.”.</span>. This is always true, but Anki makes it
	especially true.
      </p>

    <p>
      With all that said, one fun pattern is to go back to my old,
      pre-Anki notes on books, and to Ankify them. This can often be
      done quickly, and gives me a greater return on the time I&#39;ve
      invested in now mostly-forgotten books*<span>* Friends sometimes complain that many books
      are over-padded essays.  Perhaps a benefit of such padding is
      that it enforces an Anki-like spaced repetition, since readers
      take weeks to read the book.  This may be an inefficient way to
      memorize the main points, but is better than having no memory of
      the book at all.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something I haven&#39;t yet figured out is how to integrate Anki
      with note taking for my creative projects. I can&#39;t replace note
      taking with Anki – it&#39;s too slow, and for many things a
      poor use of my long-term memory. On the other hand, there are
      many benefits to using Anki for important items – fluid
      access to memory is at the foundation of so much creative
      thought.<span>Speed of associative thought
      is, I believe, important in creative work. – John
      Littlewood</span> In practice, I find myself instinctively and
      unsystematically doing some things as notes, others as Anki
      questions, and still other things as both. Overall, it works
      okay, but my sense is that it could be a lot better if I applied
      more systematic thought and experimentation. Part of the problem
      is that I don&#39;t have a very good system for note taking, period!
      If I worked more on that, I suspect the whole thing would get a
      lot better. Still, it works okay.
    </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Avoid the yes/no pattern:</strong> One bad habit I
	sometimes slide into is having lots of Anki questions with
	yes/no answers. For instance, here&#39;s a not-very-good question
	I added when learning about graphical models in machine
	learning:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	Is computing the partition function intractable for most
	graphical models?
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	The answer is “yes”. That&#39;s fine, as far as it
	goes. But it&#39;d help my understanding to elaborate the ideas in
	the question. Can I add a question about for which graphical
	models the partition function is tractable? Can I give an
	example of a graphical model for which the partition function
	is intractable? What does it mean for computing the partition
	function to be intractable anyway? Yes/no questions should, at
	the least, be considered as good candidates for question
	refactoring*<span>* By analogy with code
	smells, we can speak of “question smells”, as
	suggesting a possible need for refactoring. A yes/no
	construction is an example of a question smell.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Aren&#39;t external memory aids enough?</strong> One
	common criticism of systems such as Anki is that external
	memory devices – systems such as Google, wikis, and
	notebooks – really ought to be enough. Used well, such
	systems are, of course, extremely useful as a complement to
	Anki. But for creative work and for problem-solving there is
	something special about having an internalized
	understanding. It enables speed in associative thought, an
	ability to rapidly try out many combinations of ideas, and to
	intuit patterns, in ways not possible if you need to keep
	laboriously looking up information.
      </p>

      <p>
	Fluency matters in thinking. Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg have
	proposed*<span>* Alan Kay and Adele
	Goldberg, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Kay1977.pdf">Personal Dynamic
	Media</a> (1977).</span> the thought experiment of a flute in
	which there is “a one-second delay between blowing a
	note and hearing it!” As they observe, this is
	“absurd”.  In a similar way, certain types of
	thoughts are much easier to have when all the relevant kinds
	of understanding are held in mind. And for that, Anki is
	invaluable.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>If personal memory systems are so great, why aren&#39;t
	  they more widely used?</strong> This question is analogous
	  to the old joke about two economists who are walking along
	  when one of them spots a $20 bill. They say: “Look!
	  There&#39;s $20 on the ground!” The other replies:
	  “Impossible! If it were really there, someone would
	  have picked it up already.”
      </p>

      <p>
	The analogy is only partial. In fact, Anki seems like a
	continual supply of $20 bills lying on the ground. And it&#39;s
	reasonable to ask why it&#39;s not more widely used.  One of the
	most cited papers in the relevant research
	literature*<span>* Frank
	N. Dempster, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Dempster1988.pdf">The Spacing
	Effect: A Case Study in the Failure to Apply the Results of
	Psychological Research</a> (1988).</span> is a discussion of
	why these ideas aren&#39;t more widely used in education. Although
	written in 1988, many of the observations in the paper remain
	true today.
      </p>

      <p>
	My own personal suspicion is that there are three main
	factors:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>In experimental research on memory, people consistently
	underestimate the gains that come from distributing their
	study in a manner similar to Anki. Instead, they prefer
	last-minute cramming, and believe it produces better results,
	though many studies show it does not.
	</li>

	<li>The psychologist Robert Bjork has
	suggested*<span>*Robert
	A. Bjork, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Bjork1994.pdf">Memory and Metamemory
	Considerations in the Training of Human Beings</a>
	(1994).</span> the “principle of desirable
	difficulty”, the idea that memories are maximally
	strengthened if tested when we&#39;re on the verge of forgetting
	them. This suggests that an efficient memory system will
	intrinsically be somewhat difficult to use. Human beings have
	a complex relationship to difficult activities, and often
	dislike performing them, unless strongly motivated (in which
	case they may become pleasurable).
	</li>

	<li>Systems such as Anki are challenging to use well, and easy
	to use poorly.
	</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
	It is interesting to consider developing systems which may
	overcome some or all of these issues.
      </p>

	  
    <h2>Part II: Personal Memory Systems More Broadly</h2>

      <p>
	In the first part of this essay we looked at a particular
	personal memory system, Anki, through the lens of my personal
	experience. In the second, briefer, part of this essay we&#39;ll
	consider two broader questions about personal memory systems:
	how important is memory as a cognitive skill; and what is the
	role of cognitive science in building personal memory systems?
      </p>
      
      <h3>How important is long-term memory, anyway?</h3>
      
      <p>
	Long-term memory is sometimes disparaged. It&#39;s common for
	people to denigrate “rote memory”, especially in
	the classroom. I&#39;ve heard from many people that they dropped
	some class – organic chemistry is common – because
	it was “just a bunch of facts, and I wanted something
	involving more understanding”.
      </p>

      
      <p>
	I won&#39;t defend bad classroom teaching, or the way organic
	chemistry is often taught.  But it&#39;s a mistake to
	underestimate the importance of memory. I used to believe such
	tropes about the low importance of memory. But I now believe
	memory is at the foundation of our cognition.
      </p>

      <p>
	There are two main reasons for this change, one a personal
	experience, the other based on evidence from cognitive
	science.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let me begin with the personal experience.
      </p>

      <p>
	Over the years, I&#39;ve often helped people learn technical
	subjects such as quantum mechanics. Over time you come to see
	patterns in how people get stuck.  One common pattern is that
	people think they&#39;re getting stuck on esoteric, complex
	issues. But when you dig down it turns out they&#39;re having a
	hard time with basic notation and terminology. It&#39;s difficult
	to understand quantum mechanics when you&#39;re unclear about
	every third word or piece of notation! Every sentence is a
	struggle.
      </p>

      <p>
	It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to compose a beautiful sonnet in
	French, but only know 200 words of French. They&#39;re frustrated,
	and think the trouble is the difficulty of finding a good
	theme, striking sentiments and images, and so on. But really
	the issue is that they have only 200 words with which to
	compose.
      </p>

      <p>
	My somewhat pious belief was that if people focused more on
	remembering the basics, and worried less about the
	“difficult” high-level issues, they&#39;d find the
	high-level issues took care of themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
	But while I held this as a strong conviction about other
	people, I never realized it also applied to me.  And I had no
	idea at all how strongly it applied to me. Using Anki to read
	papers in new fields disabused me of this illusion. I found it
	almost unsettling how much easier Anki made learning such
	subjects. I now believe memory of the basics is often the
	single largest barrier to understanding. If you have a system
	such as Anki for overcoming that barrier, then you will find
	it much, much easier to read into new fields.
      </p>

      <p>
	This experience of how much easier Anki made learning a new
	technical field greatly increased my visceral appreciation for
	the importance of memory.
      </p>

      <p>
	There are also many results from cognitive science on the key
	role memory plays in cognition.
      </p>

      <p>
	One striking line of work was done (separately) by the
	researchers Adriaan de Groot and Herbert Simon, studying how
	people acquire expertise, focusing particularly on
	chess*<span>* See, for instance, Herbert A.
	Simon, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Simon1974.pdf">How Big is a Chunk?</a>,
	Science (1974), and Adriaan de Groot, <em>Thought and Choice
	in Chess</em>, Amsterdam University Press (2008, reprinted
	from 1965).</span>. They found that world-class chess experts
	saw the board differently to beginners. A beginner would see
	“a pawn here, a rook there”, and so on, a series
	of individual pieces. Masters, by contrast, saw much more
	elaborate “chunks”: combinations of pieces that
	they recognized as a unit, and were able to reason about at a
	higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces.
      </p>

      <p>
	Simon estimated chess masters learn between 25,000 and 100,000
	of these chunks during their training, and that learning the
	chunks was a key element in becoming a first-rate chess
	player. Such players really see chess positions very
	differently from beginners.
      </p>

      <p>
	Why does learning to recognize and reason about such chunks
	help so much in developing expertise? Here&#39;s a speculative,
	informal model – as far as I know, it hasn&#39;t been
	validated by cognitive scientists, so don&#39;t take it too
	seriously. I&#39;ll describe it in the context of mathematics,
	instead of chess, since mathematics is an area where I have
	experience talking with people at all ranges of ability, from
	beginners to accomplished professional mathematicians.
      </p>

      <p>
	Many people&#39;s model of accomplished mathematicians is that
	they are astoundingly bright, with very high IQs, and the
	ability to deal with very complex ideas in their mind. A
	common perception is that their smartness gives them the
	ability to deal with very complex ideas. Basically, they have
	a higher horsepower engine.
      </p>

      <p>
	It&#39;s true that top mathematicians are usually very bright. But
	here&#39;s a different explanation of what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s that,
	per Simon, many top mathematicians have, through hard work,
	internalized many more complex mathematical chunks than
	ordinary humans. And what this means is that mathematical
	situations which seem very complex to the rest of us seem very
	simple to them. So it&#39;s not that they have a higher horsepower
	mind, in the sense of being able to deal with more
	complexity. Rather, their prior learning has given them better
	chunking abilities, and so situations most people would see as
	complex they see as simple, and they find it much easier to
	reason about.
      </p>

      <p>
	Now, the concept of chunks used by Simon in his study of chess
	players actually came from a famous 1956 paper by George
	Miller, “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
	Two”*<span>* George
	A. Miller, <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The
	Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our
	Capacity for Processing Information</a> (1956).</span>.
	Miller argued that the capacity of working memory is roughly
	seven chunks. In fact, it turns out that there is variation in
	that number from person to person, and a substantial
	correlation between the capacity of an individual&#39;s working
	memory and their general intellectual ability
	(IQ)*<span>* A review of the correlation
	may be found in Phillip L. Ackerman, Margaret E. Beier, and
	Mary O. Boyle, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Ackerman2006.pdf">Working
	Memory and Intelligence: The Same or Different Constructs?</a>
	Psychological Bulletin (2006).</span>. Typically, the better
	your working memory, the higher your IQ, and vice versa.
      </p>

      <p>
	Exactly what Miller meant by chunks he left somewhat vague,
	writing:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	The contrast of the terms bit and chunk also serves to
	highlight the fact that we are not very definite about what
	constitutes a chunk of information. For example, the memory
	span of five words that Hayes obtained… might just as
	appropriately have been called a memory span of 15 phonemes,
	since each word had about three phonemes in it. Intuitively,
	it is clear that the subjects were recalling five words, not
	15 phonemes, but the logical distinction is not immediately
	apparent. We are dealing here with a process of organizing or
	grouping the input into familiar units or chunks, and a great
	deal of learning has gone into the formation of these familiar
	units.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Put another way, in Miller&#39;s account the chunk was effectively
	the <em>basic unit</em> of working memory. And so Simon and
	his collaborators were studying the basic units used in the
	working memory of chess players. If those chunks were more
	complex, then that meant a player&#39;s working memory had a
	higher effective capacity. In particular, someone with a lower
	IQ but able to call on more complex chunks would be able to
	reason about more complex situations than someone with a
	higher IQ but less complex internalized chunks.
      </p>

      <p>
	In other words, having more chunks memorized in some domain is
	somewhat like an effective boost to a person&#39;s IQ in that
	domain.
      </p>

      <p>
	Okay, that&#39;s a speculative informal model. Regardless of
	whether it&#39;s correct, it does seem that internalizing
	high-level chunks is a crucial part of acquiring
	expertise. However, that doesn&#39;t then necessarily imply that
	the use of systems such as Anki will speed up acquisition of
	such chunks. It&#39;s merely an argument that long-term memory
	plays a crucial role in the acquisition of some types of
	expertise. Still, it seems plausible that regular use of
	systems such as Anki may speed up the acquisition of the
	high-level chunks used by experts*<span>*
	To determine this it would help to understand exactly how
	these chunks arise. That still seems to be poorly
	understood. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it involved
	considerable analysis and problem-solving, in addition to
	long-term memory.</span>.  And that those chunks are then at
	the heart of effective cognition, including our ability to
	understand, to problem solve, and to create.
      </p>

    <h3>Distributed practice</h3>

    <p>
      Why does Anki work?  In this section we briefly look at one of
      the key underlying ideas from cognitive science, known
      as <em>distributed practice</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose you&#39;re introduced to someone at a party, and they tell
      you their name. If you&#39;re paying attention, and their name isn&#39;t
      too unusual, you&#39;ll almost certainly remember their name 20
      seconds later. But you&#39;re more likely to have forgotten their
      name in an hour, and more likely still to have forgotten their
      name in a month.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, memories decay. This isn&#39;t news!  But the great German
      psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus had the good idea of studying
      memory decay systematically and
      quantitatively*<span>* Hermann
      Ebbinghaus, <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/index.htm">Memory:
      A Contribution to Experimental Psychology</a> (1885). A recent
      replication of Ebbinghaus&#39;s results may be found in: Jaap
      M. J. Murre and Joeri
      Dros, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120644">Replication
      and Analysis of Ebbinghaus&#39; Forgetting Curve</a>
      (2015).</span>. In particular, he was interested in how quickly
      memories decay, and what causes the decay. To study this,
      Ebbinghaus memorized strings of nonsense syllables –
      things like “fim“ and “pes” – and
      later tested himself, recording how well he retained those
      syllables after different time intervals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ebbinghaus found that the probability of correctly recalling an
      item declined (roughly) exponentially with time.  Today, this is
      called the <em>Ebbinghaus forgetting curve</em>:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Ebbinghaus.png"/></p><p>
      What determines the steepness of the curve, i.e., how quickly
      memories decay? In fact, the steepness depends on many
      things. For instance, it may be steeper for more complex or less
      familiar concepts. You may find it easier to remember a name
      that sounds similar to names you&#39;ve heard before: say, Richard
      Hamilton, rather than Suzuki Harunobu. So they&#39;d have a
      shallower curve.  Similarly, you may find it easier to remember
      something visual than verbal. Or something verbal rather than a
      motor skill. And if you use more elaborate ways of remembering
      – mnemonics, for instance, or just taking care to connect
      an idea to other things you already know – you may be able
      to flatten the curve out*<span>* Although
      this expansion is much studied, there is surprisingly little
      work building detailed predictive models of the expansion.  An
      exception is: Burr Settles and Brendan
      Meeder, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Settles2016.pdf">A Trainable Spaced
      Repetition Model for Language Learning</a> (2016). This paper
      builds a regression model to predict the decay rate of student
      memory on Duolingo, the online language learning platform. The
      result was not only better prediction of decay rates, but also
      improved Duolingo student engagement.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose you&#39;re introduced to a person at a party, and then don&#39;t
      think about their name for 20 minutes. But then you need to
      introduce them to someone else, and so need to bring it to
      mind. Immediately after that, your probability of recall will
      again be very high.  Ebbinghaus&#39;s research suggested that the
      probability will decay exponentially after the re-test, but the
      rate of decay will be slower than it was initially. In fact,
      subsequent re-tests will slow the decay still more, a gradually
      flattening out of the decay curve as the memory is consolidated
      through multiple recall events:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Ebbinghaus_repeat.png"/></p><p>
      This gradual increase in decay time underlies the design of Anki
      and similar memory systems. It&#39;s why Anki gradually expands the
      time periods between testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      These phenomena are part of a broader set of ideas which have
      been extensively studied by scientists. There are several
      related terms used for this set of phenomena, but we&#39;ll use the
      phrase “distributed practice”, meaning practice
      which is distributed in time, ideally in a way designed to
      maximally promote retention.  This is in contrast to cramming,
      often known as massed practice, where people try to fit all
      their study into just one session, relying on repetition.
    </p>

    <h3>On the role of cognitive science in the design of systems to
    augment cognition</h3>

      <p>
	Since Ebbinghaus, there&#39;s been thousands of studies of
	different variations of distributed practice. These studies
	have taught us a great deal about the behavior of long-term
	memory. Most of all, they show emphatically that distributed
	practice outperforms massed
	practice*<span>* Many experiments also try
	to assess participants&#39; perception of the effectiveness of
	massed practice versus distributed practice. Remarkably, they
	often believe that massed practice is more effective, despite
	the fact that it is reliably outperformed by distributed
	practice.</span>.  It&#39;s tempting to jump into that literature,
	and to use it as a guide to the design of memory
	systems*<span>* Rather than do such a
	review, let me point to several reviews which serve as useful
	entry points. Benedict Carey&#39;s book “How We Learn”
	(2015) is a good introduction at a popular level.  Useful
	reviews of the distributed practice literature include:
	Cepeda <em>et
	al</em>, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Cepeda2006.pdf">Distributed Practice
	in Verbal Recall Tasks: A Review and Quantitative
	Synthesis</a> (2006); and: Gwern
	Branwen, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Spaced-Repetition</a>.</span>. But
	it&#39;s also worth thinking about the limitations of that
	literature as a guide to the development of systems.
      </p>

    <p>
      While scientists have done a tremendous number of studies of
      distributed practice, many fundamental questions about
      distributed practice remain poorly understood.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don&#39;t understand in detail why exponential decay of memory
      occurs, or when that model breaks down. We don&#39;t have good
      models of what determines the rate of decay, and why it varies
      for different types of memories. We don&#39;t understand why the
      decay takes longer after subsequent recalls. And we have little
      understanding of the best way of expanding the inter-study
      intervals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there are many partial theories to answer these and
      other fundamental questions. But there&#39;s no single,
      quantitatively predictive, broadly accepted general theory. And
      so in that sense, we know little about distributed practice, and
      are probably decades (if not more) away from a reasonably full
      understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      To illustrate this point concretely, let me mention just one
      example: there are times when our memories don&#39;t decay, but get
      better over time, even when we&#39;re not aware of explicit acts of
      recall.  Informally, you may have noticed this in your own
      life. The psychologist William James made the tongue-in-cheek
      observation, which he attributed to an unnamed German author,
      that*<span>* William James, “The
      Principles of Psychology” (1890).</span>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      we learn to swim during the winter and to skate during the
      summer.
    </blockquote>

      <p>
	In fact, exactly such an effect was experimentally verified in
	an 1895 study of Axel Oehrn*<span>* Axel
	Oehrn, Experimentelle Studien zur Individualpsychologie
	(1895).</span>. While subsequent experiments have confirmed
	this result, it depends sensitively on the type of material
	being memorized, on the exact time intervals, and many other
	variables.  Now, in some sense this contradicts the Ebbinghaus
	exponential forgetting curve. In practice, a pretty good
	heuristic is that the Ebbinghaus curve holds approximately,
	but there are exceptions, usually over limited times, and for
	very specific types of materials.
      </p>

      <p>
	I don&#39;t mention this to undermine your belief in the
	Ebbinghaus model. But rather as a caution: memory is
	complicated, we don&#39;t understand many of the big picture
	questions well, and we should be careful before we put too
	much faith in any given model.
      </p>

      <p>
	With all that said: the basic effects underlying distributed
	practice and the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve are real, large,
	and have been confirmed by many experiments. Effects like that
	discovered by Oehrn are less important by comparison.
      </p>

      <p>
	This places us in a curious situation: we have enough
	understanding of memory to conclude that a system like Anki
	should help a lot. But many of the choices needed in the
	design of such a system must be made in an
	<em>ad hoc</em> way, guided by intuition and unconfirmed
	hypotheses. The experiments in the scientific literature
	do <em>not</em> yet justify those design choices. The reason
	is that those experiments are mostly not intended to address
	those questions. They&#39;ll focus on specific types of
	information to memorize. Or they&#39;ll focus on relatively short
	periods of time – memorization over a day or a week, not
	for years. Such work helps us build a better theory of memory,
	but it&#39;s not necessarily answering the questions designers
	need to build systems.
      </p>

      <p>
	As a consequence, system designers must look elsewhere, to
	informal experiments and theories. Anki, for example, uses a
	spacing algorithm developed by Piotr Wozniak on the basis of
	personal experimentation*<span>* See: Piotr
	Wozniak, <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/english/algsm11.htm">Repetition
	spacing algorithm used in SuperMemo 2002 through SuperMemo
	2006</a>. Anki uses algorithm SM-2.</span>. Although
	Wozniak has published
	a <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/english/publicat.htm">number
	of papers</a>, they are informal reports, and don&#39;t abide by
	the norms of the conventional cognitive science literature.
      </p>

      <p>
	In some sense, this is not satisfactory: we don&#39;t have a very
	good understanding of what spacing schedule to use. But a
	system has to use some schedule, and so designers do the best
	they can. This seems likely to work much better than naive
	approaches, but over the long run it&#39;d be good to have an
	approach based on a detailed theory of human memory.
    </p>

      <p>
	Now, one response to this is to say that you should design
	scientifically, and have good experimental evidence for all
	design choices. I&#39;ve heard this used as a criticism of the
	designers of systems such as Anki, that they make too
	many <em>ad hoc</em> guesses, not backed by a systematic
	scientific understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
	But what are they supposed to do? Wait 50 or 100 years, until
	those answers are in? Give up design, and become memory
	scientists for the next 30 years, so they can give properly
	“scientific” answers to all the questions they
	need answered in the design of their systems?
      </p>

      <p>
	This isn&#39;t the way design works, nor the way it should work.
      </p>

      <p>
	If designers waited until all the evidence was in, no-one
	would ever design anything. In practice, what you want is
	bold, imaginative design, exploring many ideas, but inspired
	and informed (and not too constrained) by what is known
	scientifically. Ideally, alongside this there would be a much
	slower feedback loop, whereby design choices would suggest
	questions about memory, which would lead to new scientific
	experiments, and thence to an improved understanding of
	memory, which would in turn suggest new avenues for design.
      </p>

      <p>
	Such a balance is not easy to achieve.  The human-computer
	interaction (HCI) community has tried to achieve it in the
	systems they build, not just for memory, but for augmenting
	human cognition in general. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worked so
	well. It seems to me that they&#39;ve given up a lot of boldness
	and imagination and aspiration in their
	design*<span>* As an outsider, I&#39;m aware
	this comment won&#39;t make me any friends within the HCI
	community. On the other hand, I don&#39;t think it does any good
	to be silent, either. When I look at major events within the
	community, such as the CHI conference, the overwhelming
	majority of papers seem timid when compared to early work on
	augmentation. It&#39;s telling that publishing conventional static
	papers (pdf, not even interactive JavaScript and HTML) is
	still so central to the field. </span>. At the same time,
	they&#39;re not doing full-fledged cognitive science either
	– they&#39;re not developing a detailed understanding of the
	mind. Finding the right relationship between imaginative
	design and cognitive science is a core problem for work on
	augmentation, and it&#39;s not trivial.
      </p>

      <p>
	In a similar vein, it&#39;s tempting to imagine cognitive
	scientists starting to build systems. While this may sometimes
	work, I think it&#39;s unlikely to yield good results in most
	cases. Building effective systems, even prototypes, is
	difficult.  Cognitive scientists for the most part lack the
	skills and the design imagination to do it well.
      </p>

    <p> This suggests to me the need for a separate field of human
      augmentation. That field will take input from cognitive
      science. But it will fundamentally be a design science, oriented
      toward bold, imaginative design, and building systems from
      prototype to large-scale deployment.
    </p>

      about this essay. I&#39;m particularly grateful to Andy Matuschak
      for many thoughtful and enjoyable conversations, and especially
      for pointing out how unusual is the view that Anki can be a
      virtuoso skill for understanding, not just a means of
      remembering facts. Finally, thanks to everyone who commented
      on <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/957763229454774272">my
      Twitter thread</a> about Anki.
    </p>


    <h2>Appendix 1: analysis of Anki study time</h2>
      
    <p>
      Here&#39;s a ballpark analysis of the effort required to study an
      Anki card for recall over 20 years – what we might
      reasonably consider lifetime recall. Note that the analysis is
      sensitive to the detailed assumptions made, so the time
      estimates shouldn&#39;t be taken too seriously. Nonetheless, it&#39;s
      useful to get a sense of the times involved.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a card is initially entered, Anki requires reviews after
      just 1 minute and then 10 minutes. After those reviews the
      interval between reviews rises substantially, to 1 day. The
      interval expansion rate after that may vary a
      little*<span>* The reason is that Anki allows
      you to specify that you found a card “easy” or
      “hard” when you review it, in addition to the
      generic “good” (meaning you got it right) or
      “again” (meaning you got it wrong). Those additional
      options vary the exact rate of interval expansion. In practice,
      I nearly always choose “good”, or tell Anki that I
      got the card wrong.</span>, but for my cards the typical
      expansion rate is by a factor of about 2.4 for each successful
      review. That means that successful reviews will raise the
      interval to 2.4 days, then to 2.4 * 2.4 = 6.76 days, and so on.
      On average, I get about 1 in 12 cards wrong, so by the 12th card
      we&#39;re up to about 2.4<sup>9</sup> = 2,642 days between
      reviews. Note that we raise to the 9<sup>th</sup> power rather
      than the 12<sup>th</sup> power, because it&#39;s not until the third
      repetition of a card that the interval reaches 1 day.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you sum those intervals all up, it suggests the typical time
      between failed reviews is about 12 years.  Note, however, that I
      haven&#39;t been using Anki for nearly that long, and this estimate
      may be over-optimistic.  We can get a lower bound on the time
      between failures by observing that my mean interval between card
      reviews is already 1.2 years.  To achieve an interval of 1.2
      years requires about 0.9 years of successful prior reviews, so
      on average my cards involve at least 2.1 years between
      failures. However, the real number may be much higher, since
      there&#39;s no reason to assume my next review on most of those
      cards is going to fail.  So let&#39;s say that a conservative
      estimate is a mean time between failures of between 4 and 7
      years.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we assume the mean time between failures is 4 years, then
      over 20 years that means 5 failures, and reviewing 5 failures *
      10 reviews per period = 50 times, for a total of 50 * 8 seconds
      = 400 seconds, or about 7 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      If instead we assume the mean time between failures is 7 years,
      then over 20 years that means roughly 3 failures, and reviewing
      3 failures * 11 reviews per period = 33 times, for a total of 33
      * 8 seconds ≈ 260 seconds, or about 4 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that in Anki&#39;s model a failure resets the review interval
      back to 10 minutes, then to 1 day, 2.4 days, and so on. In
      practice, that seems much too conservative.  After one or two
      failures with a card I usually catch on, and it would be better
      if Anki wasn&#39;t so draconian in resetting the review schedule. A
      better review schedule would reduce the total study time, and I
      wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a typical commitment of ˜2
      minutes was possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Appendix 2: Using Anki to learn APIs</h2>
    
    <p>
      A good use for Anki is to assist in learning APIs.  Here&#39;s some
      patterns which work for me, and a few warnings about
      anti-patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      It begins with me deciding there&#39;s some API I&#39;d like to learn to
      use in a project. Some of the time, I just want to use the API a
      little – say, for 50-100 lines of code, or even just some
      1-10 line code snippets. In that case I&#39;m best off winging it,
      adapting snippets from elsewhere, and consulting the docs as
      needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But suppose I know I will use the API more seriously in a
      project.  For instance, for my
      essay <a href="http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/">Thought as a
      Technology</a> I wanted to build some prototypes using 3d
      graphics, and decided to learn the basics of
      the <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> Javascript
      library.
    </p>

    <p>
      One tempting failure mode is to think “Oh, I should master
      the API first”, and then to dive into tutorials or the
      documentation. Apart from a quick skim of a tutorial or the
      documentation, that&#39;s a mistake. A better approach is to find a
      small, functioning piece of code that does something related to
      the core functionality of my project. It doesn&#39;t need to be
      similar to the whole project, but ideally implements one or two
      similar features, and is a few tens or hundreds of lines of code
      long. I get that code running, then start making small tweaks,
      adding bits of functionality I need, taking out bits that I
      don&#39;t, and trying to understand and improve the code.
    </p>

    <p><span>
      I probably err on the side of just making things
      happen… I get so much of a thrill bringing things to
      life… as soon as it comes to life it starts telling
      you what it is. - Dan Ingalls
    </span></p><p>
      The great thing about this is that I need only change 1 to 5
      lines of code at a time, and I see meaningful progress toward my
      goals. That&#39;s exciting. To use a metaphor from machine learning,
      it&#39;s like doing gradient descent in the space of meaningful
      projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, while doing this, I&#39;ll constantly be looking up
      things in the docs, on StackOverflow, and so on. I&#39;ll also be
      reading and understanding pieces of the code I started
      from. It&#39;s tempting to Ankify all this, but it&#39;s a mistake: it
      takes too much time, and you Ankify too much that later turns
      out to be little use.  However, when something is clearly a
      central concept, or I know I&#39;ll reuse it often, it&#39;s worth
      adding to Anki. In this way, I gradually build up a knowledge
      base of things I can use in real, live projects. And, slowly, I
      get better and better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once I&#39;m making real progress on my project, and confident I&#39;ve
      made a good choice of API, then it makes sense to work through a
      tutorial. I usually dip quickly into several such tutorials, and
      identify the one I believe I can learn most quickly from. And
      then I work through it. I do Ankify at this stage, but keep it
      relatively light. It&#39;s tempting to Ankify everything, but I end
      up memorizing lots of useless information, at great time
      cost. It&#39;s much better to only Ankify material I know I&#39;ll need
      repeatedly. Usually that means I can already see I need it right
      now, at the current stage of my project. On the first pass, I&#39;m
      conservative, Ankifying less material. Then, once I&#39;ve gone
      through a tutorial once, I go back over it, this time Ankifying
      everything I&#39;m likely to need later. This second pass is usually
      quite rapid – often faster than the first pass – but
      on the second pass I have more context, and my judgment about
      what to Ankify is better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I continue doing this, bouncing back and forth between working
      on my project and working on Anki as I make my way through
      tutorials and documentation, as well as material that comes up
      while reading code – code from others, and even code I&#39;ve
      written myself. I find it surprisingly helpful to Ankify the
      APIs for code I&#39;ve personally written, if they&#39;re likely to be
      useful in the future. Just because I wrote something doesn&#39;t
      mean I&#39;ll remember it in future!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So: don&#39;t jump into Ankifying tutorials and documentation
      straight away. Wait, and do it in tandem with serious work on
      your project. I must admit, part of the reason I advise this is
      because I find the advice hard to take myself.  I nearly always
      regret not following it. I start a new project, think “Oh,
      I need such-and-such an API”, and then dive into a
      tutorial, spending hours on it. But I struggle and struggle and
      make very slow progress. Until I remember to find some working
      code to start from, and immediately find things are going much
      better. I then swear to never use the tutorial-first approach
      again. Unfortunately, in practice, I find it seductive.
    </p>

      <p>
	The overall process is much like the common learning-by-doing
	approach to a new API, where you gradually learn the API
	through repetition, while working on a project. The main
	difference is that the occasional interspersed use of Anki
	considerably speeds up the rate at which you agglomerate new
	knowledge.
      </p>
      
    <p>
      A potential failure mode is to think “Oh, I might want to
      learn such-and-such an API one day, so I should start adding
      cards, even though I don&#39;t currently have a project where I&#39;m
      using the API.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I&#39;ve tried this a couple of times, and my advice is: don&#39;t do
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s a form of a problem I described in the main body of the
      essay: the temptation to stockpile knowledge against some day
      when you&#39;ll use it. You will learn far more quickly if you&#39;re
      simultaneously using the API seriously in a project.  Using the
      API to create something new helps you identify what is important
      to remember from the API. And it also – this is
      speculation – sends a signal to your brain saying
      “this really matters”, and that helps your memory
      quite a bit. So if you&#39;re tempted to do speculative
      Ankification, please don&#39;t. And if you find yourself starting,
      stop.
    </p>

    <p>
      A more challenging partial failure mode is Ankifying what turn
      into orphan APIs. That is, I&#39;ll use a new API for a project, and
      Ankify some material from the API. Then the project finishes,
      and I don&#39;t immediately have another project using the same
      API. I then find my mind won&#39;t engage so well with the cards
      – there&#39;s a half-conscious thought of “why am I
      learning this useless stuff?” I just no longer find the
      cards as interesting as when I was actively using the API.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a difficult situation. I use the rule of thumb that if
      it seems likely I&#39;m not going to use the API again, I delete the
      cards when they come up. But if it seems likely I&#39;ll use the API
      in the next year or so, I keep them in the deck. It&#39;s not a
      perfect solution, since I really do slightly disconnect from the
      cards. But it&#39;s the best compromise I&#39;ve found.
    </p>

			<p>This post originally appeared in my <a href="https://mailchi.mp/wherewithall/should-i-create-a-performance-improvement-plan-for-my-direct-report">newsletter</a>. <a href="http://eepurl.com/dxUybL">Subscribe</a> to receive it!</p>
		

		<p>There’s lots to be said (and felt) about Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs); they’re often a step that a company takes when an employee is not meeting the expectations of their role, and their manager (or the company) is considering whether or not to terminate this person’s employment.</p>

<p>I’m oversimplifying here, but you can think of a PIP as explicit documentation about what a person needs to do differently within a specific timeframe, both to make sure there’s clarity and a shared understanding between them and the manager/company. If the employee is ultimately fired, a PIP also creates a paper trail, should the employee bring a lawsuit about their termination.</p>

<p>Often there’s a template that HR will suggest a manager use to draft the PIP, ensuring it outlines behaviors that the employee needs to demonstrate to their manager, (again, within a certain timeline).</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been on a PIP, you might have seen it as a signal that you’re about to be fired.</p>

<p>It’s not always the case that a PIP results in termination; I’ve definitely seen the PIP process help someone <em>finally</em> receive a clear articulation of what they need to do differently, which led to them adjusting their approach and getting the support they need to be successful! But because of how it’s traditionally used, PIPs are one of the most common HR processes I’ve seen that leave folks feeling unfairly treated by their managers and the company.</p>

<p>So what do you do, as a manager, when your own manager or HR rep suggests that you create a PIP for your underperforming direct report?</p>

<h2 id="why-might-you-create-a-pip">Why might you create a PIP?</h2>

<p>I have… a lot of complicated feelings about PIPs.</p>

<p>Documenting feedback around missed expectations is, of course, important, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s obvious value in writing down what’s expected of a person in a particular role; that’s why we have job descriptions and career ladders! And depending upon how these frameworks work at your organization, it can be helpful to further contextualize the responsibilities of a general role/level to your report’s specific situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person might not recognize that they need to behave differently, or that they’re not meeting expectations. So it’s crucial for managers to clearly, directly, and fairly give them a heads-up about the behavior gap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, performance feedback has already been given to someone, but it was in a piecemeal way over a stretch of time. So succinctly collecting all of the crucial feedback in one place might be the first time that they’re seeing everything put together. It might be a shock to them, but it’s really important to see the narrative that has developed about their performance, perhaps unbeknownst to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s unfair to use <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/tough-love-for-managers-giving-feedback/#3-i-get-that-youre-worried-about-how-someones-going-to-react-to-your-negative-feedback-especially-while-the-world-is-upside-down-but-youre-not-allowed-to-soften-the-feedback-so-much-that-your-report-doesnt-understand-what-they-should-do-next">fuzzy language</a> when your direct report is missing the mark. It’s also unfair to *only* use your mouthwords when giving essential feedback, and then expect that person to recall what was said going forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing down role expectations—and feedback about missed expectations—in a shared place that can be referred back to later is one of the most <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/performance-reviews-should-be-unsurprising-fair-and-motivating/">fair</a> things we can do as managers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So why do I have complicated feelings about PIPs? Here’s what usually makes me concerned when I hear a manager (or their HR rep) is considering creating a PIP. It’s complicated, and here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While a PIP restates role expectations and gives the employee a heads up that they need to behave differently, the typical PIP doesn’t give them new tools, training, or support, nor does it change their role, etc. So if a manager (or a company) doesn’t believe a person will be able to meet role expectations, then creating a PIP won’t help them—it’ll unkindly string them along through a weeks-long process with a destination only known to those delivering the PIP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A PIP helps the company (it’ll be documentation, if needed, for future inquiries from the legal department) but it doesn’t really change the situation for the employee. That said, a PIP <em>will</em> give the employee a heads up that termination of their employment is on the table, and signal that they might want to start looking for a new role, if they don’t feel like they can meet expectations in their current one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be problematic knock-on effects from PIPs that deserve their own post. For example, receiving a PIP changes other leaders’ perceptions of that employee, and this can have lasting effects on their ability to make progress in their career.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a case when a PIP <em>does</em> help an employee? Sure: if a person hasn’t received a clear signal (or hasn’t recognized) that they’re missing baseline role expectations, then writing a PIP can be that neon-red, flashing sign that they need to change their behavior.</p>

<p>So today, I want to offer you a step-by-step approach if you’re faced with the “to PIP, or not to PIP?” question as a manager. My goal is to help you navigate this process in a way that’s as fair as possible to your direct report, while recognizing that HR may require you to create one regardless of whether or not it could actually change the situation.</p>

<h2 id="pip-decision-framework">PIP Decision Framework</h2>

<p>When you’re faced with the question of whether or not to create a PIP, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Ask yourself, “Do I believe this person <strong>will be able to meet these expectations</strong> within 30 days, and consistently thereafter?” If the answer is “no”, consider terminating their employment with a healthy severance package, or finding a new role for them within the organization where they could be more successful.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you’re confident this person could begin meeting these expectations within 30 days—or if you’re just not sure yet—your next step is to brainstorm privately with the prompt, <strong>“What haven&#39;t I stated clearly/bluntly yet to this person about what I expect of someone in this role?”</strong></p>
	<p>It’s your job as a manager to succinctly and directly communicate the expectations of a role, and do the same when you see crucial gaps in someone’s performance of that role. Even if you’ve said these things to them before, there is always *something* that you can newly state or try to explain/describe differently for your direct report.</p></li>
	<li><p>Meet with your report. State (or reiterate) the gap between their work and what’s expected in their role (including anything you identified in step #2) as clearly as possible, to see if the new information/clarity/reframe changes things.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>After you’ve had the conversation in step #3—or at the end of that conversation, if it feels appropriate—ask your report, “<strong>What&#39;s in the way</strong> of meeting these expectations?”</p>
		<p>With this question, your goal is to figure out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Does this person see the <strong>importance</strong> of meeting these expectations?</li>
			<li>Do we see these expectations <strong>differently/disagree</strong> on what they mean or look like?</li>
			<li>Do they not have the <strong>resources</strong> required to meet the expectations? (Are they lacking time? Clarity? Answers from stakeholders?)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on how the “What’s in the way?” conversation goes, you’ll decide to create a PIP or not.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/">feedback equation</a> to underscore why this behavior change is relevant to the things they care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acknowledge that while you might disagree with each other about the importance of this behavior change, it’s a requirement of this role.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they continue to disagree on the importance of an expectation, restate that this behavior/outcome is expected of a person in their role, and you need them to meet that expectation. If they continue to disagree, <em>and</em> you believe that they are capable of meeting this expectation, you might create a PIP as one final attempt to communicate the importance of them meeting this expectation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-you-and-your-report-dont-have-a-shared-understanding-of-these-expectations">If you and your report don’t have a shared understanding of these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
	<li><p>Spend more time clarifying their role requirements with them. You might need to use different examples, identify new signals of what success looks like in the role, ask coaching questions to help them connect their own dots, etc. Don’t be afraid to be extremely direct in this conversation; you can be <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/be-directive-without-being-a-jerk/">blunt and clear without being a jerk</a>. Employ the variety of tools in your manager toolbox to try to gain that shared understanding of what’s expected.</p>
	<p>If you gain a shared understanding of the baseline requirements of the role, but your direct report still disagrees on the importance of a particular responsibility, revisit the section above, “<a href="#if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations</a>”.</p></li>
	<li><p>After you spend more time clarifying the expectations, you might revisit existing shared role documentation (job description, career ladder, etc.) and see where it needs to be updated or edited. Your goal is to create more clarity for *everybody* in that role about what’s expected of them, and what success looks like.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-they-dont-have-the-resources-to-meet-these-expectations">If they don’t have the resources to meet these expectations:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Partner with your report and HR to see if you can create (reasonable) accommodations for them. (For example, if someone is being blocked from getting timely information that’s necessary to do their job, I would partner with my report to figure out a workaround, or I’ll directly step in to get them what they need.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, clearly state that it is their responsibility in this role to develop/find those resources. (For example, it’s <em>their</em> responsibility to respond to questions via chat from their stakeholders within a certain timeframe during common work hours, or find a backup to take over if they need to step away from their computer.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-you-choose-to-create-a-pip">If you choose to create a PIP</h2>

<p>If you decide writing a PIP is the best next step for your employee (or if you’re required to write one by HR, your manager, etc.), make sure that the contents of the PIP are <strong>measurable</strong> and <strong>time-bound</strong>. A PIP is about communicating the importance of meeting a particular expectation, and making sure it’s possible that you and your direct report can both objectively see whether or not they’re meeting those expectations in <em>n</em> days/weeks.</p>

<p>After you write the first draft, re-read it to see if these are <strong>things you expect of anybody in this role</strong>, or if these are unique expectations you have for this specific person. I’ve seen drafts of PIPs where the manager has softened the expectations (like if the role requires writing a report every week, the manager wrote “deliver a report at least every other week” in the PIP). I’ve also seen managers refer to expectations <em>beyond</em> what’s normally required in the role (like a requirement to “present your findings to the VP” when the standard expectation of the role is to simply create a dashboard). The document should describe measurable, time-bound expectations that match what’s expected of <em>anybody</em> in this role.</p>

<p>PIPs are a complex tool that each organization approaches and utilizes differently. As someone’s manager, <strong>you do have agency</strong> to push back on what HR is asking you to do, ask for more time to give your report clear and specific feedback, suggest tweaks to the process, advocate for an alternative (like immediate termination with a severance package that supports the employee with pay and health insurance for a few months), etc. Your efforts may or may not change the path forward, but I believe it’s worth it to optimize for fairness to your employee during this really tough process while recognizing your responsibility as a manager.</p>
