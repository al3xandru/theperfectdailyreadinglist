    <p>Tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It allows you to work with multiple terminal sessions at once. </p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>It is easy to install, and there are many guides already out there, so I won&#39;t cover it in this blog post. </p>
<h3>Tmux terminology</h3>
<p>So, let us start with the basics.</p>
<p><code>tmux server (programm) &gt; session &gt; window &gt; pane</code></p>
<p>The tmux server starts after running tmux. You can work on the attached sessions or detach them so they run in the background. Every server can have multiple sessions, every session can have multiple windows, and we can split a window into multiple panes. The pane is a normal terminal window at the end.</p>
<p><img alt="tmux-overview" src="https://ittavern.com/images/blog/tmux-primer-1.png"/></p>
<p>There are a lot of use cases for it. Tmux makes is easy to separate projects in different windows or sessions.</p>
<h5>The prefix or lead and meta-key</h5>
<p>The default prefix (or sometimes called &#39;lead&#39;) is <code>CTRL</code> + <code>b</code> (or <code>C-b</code>) and it is usually the start of a tmux shortcut or to use a tmux command. When you see something like: <code>Prefix</code> + <code>c</code>, press <code>CTRL</code> + <code>b</code>, and then <code>c</code>. I prefer <code>CTRL</code> + <code>s</code> for example. I&#39;ll explain how to change it in the next section.</p>
<p>As a side note: you&#39;ll find some shortcuts with an <code>M</code> in them. This is the <code>meta</code>-key. It is <code>ALT</code> for Linux, I think <code>CMD</code> in MacOS, and sometimes even <code>ESC</code>. The <code>meta</code>-key is rarely used, but worth looking it up.</p>
<h5>The config file</h5>
<p>You can temporarily change your tmux config by entering the setting:</p>
<p><code>Prefix</code> + <code>:set -g prefix C-s</code></p>
<p>This would change the <code>Prefix</code> as we described it before. If you want to make changes permanently, edit the config file. On Linux, the config file is usually in the home directory of the user <code>~/.tmux.conf</code>. If there is no config file, simply create it, and restart tmux - or reload it (will show in the end of this section). Just put <code>set -g prefix C-s</code> into the config file and tmux will use it after the restart.</p>
<p>There are many ways to customize tmux. Some examples: Vim-like bindings for pane movements, enabling mouse support, setting keyboard shortcuts, and so on.</p>
<p>The easiest way to reload the config file after changes is to use the following tmux command: <code>Prefix</code> + <code>:source-file ~/.tmux.conf</code> <em>(change the path accordingly)</em>. </p>
<h3>Working with panes</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, you can split a window in multiple panes. You can split the window vertically or horizontally as you wish and change it as much as you want. I won&#39;t cover everything in this post, but I&#39;ll show you the basics.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Split horizontally:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>%</code>
</dd>
<dt>Split vertically:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>&#34;</code>
</dd>
<dt>Move to another pane:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>ARROW KEY</code>
</dd>
<dt>Convert the current pane into a new window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>!</code>
</dd>
<dt>Close current pane:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>x</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are shortcuts for resizing, moving panes around, and so on, but those aren&#39;t that important for this primer.</p>
<p>Side note: I just wrote a separate post about sending input to all panes within a window. Feel free to check it out <a href="https://ittavern.com/tmux-synchronize-the-input-of-all-panes-within-a-window/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Working with windows</h3>
<p>I prefer to separate my projects with windows instead of sessions, but that is my personal preference.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Create a new window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>c</code>
</dd>
<dt>Rename current window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>,</code>
</dd>
<dt>Close current window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>&amp;</code>
</dd>
<dt>Switch to next window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>n</code>
</dd>
<dt>Switch to previous window:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>p</code>
</dd>
<dt>Switch to window by number:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>0</code>-<code>9</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Working with sessions</h3>
<p>Let me start with a shortcut that I just learned recently.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Overview:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>w</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This gives you a quick overview of all sessions and windows and lets you switch quickly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Show all sessions:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux ls</code></dd>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>s</code>
</dd>
<dt>Create new session:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux new -s new-session</code></dd>
<dd><code>:new -s new-session</code></dd>
<dt>Rename session:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>$</code>
</dd>
<dt>Detach session (will be active in the background):</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>d</code>
</dd>
<dt>Close a session:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux kill-session -t old-session</code></dd>
<dt>Attach session:</dt>
<dd><code>tmux attach -t old-session</code></dd>
<dt>Move to next session:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>)</code>
</dd>
<dt>Move to previous session:</dt>
<dd>
<code>Prefix</code> + <code>(</code>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Go is a new language.  Although it borrows ideas from
existing languages,
it has unusual properties that make effective Go programs
different in character from programs written in its relatives.
A straightforward translation of a C++ or Java program into Go
is unlikely to produce a satisfactory result—Java programs
are written in Java, not Go.
On the other hand, thinking about the problem from a Go
perspective could produce a successful but quite different
program.
In other words,
to write Go well, it&#39;s important to understand its properties
and idioms.
It&#39;s also important to know the established conventions for
programming in Go, such as naming, formatting, program
construction, and so on, so that programs you write
will be easy for other Go programmers to understand.
</p>

<p>
This document gives tips for writing clear, idiomatic Go code.
It augments the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec">language specification</a>,
the <a href="https://go.dev/tour/">Tour of Go</a>,
and <a href="https://go.dev/doc/code.html">How to Write Go Code</a>,
all of which you
should read first.
</p>

<p>
Note added January, 2022:
This document was written for Go&#39;s
release in 2009, and has not been updated significantly since.
Although it is a good guide to understand how to use the language
itself, thanks to the stability of the language, it says little
about the libraries and nothing about significant changes to the
Go ecosystem since it was written, such as the build system, testing,
modules, and polymorphism.
There are no plans to update it, as so much has happened and a large
and growing set of documents, blogs, and books do a fine job of
describing modern Go usage.
Effective Go continues to be useful, but the reader should
understand it is far from a complete guide.
See <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28782">issue
28782</a> for context.
</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>
The <a href="https://go.dev/src/">Go package sources</a>
are intended to serve not
only as the core library but also as examples of how to
use the language.
Moreover, many of the packages contain working, self-contained
executable examples you can run directly from the
<a href="https://golang.org">golang.org</a> web site, such as
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/strings/#example_Map">this one</a> (if
necessary, click on the word &#34;Example&#34; to open it up).
If you have a question about how to approach a problem or how something
might be implemented, the documentation, code and examples in the
library can provide answers, ideas and
background.
</p>


<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>

<p>
Formatting issues are the most contentious
but the least consequential.
People can adapt to different formatting styles
but it&#39;s better if they don&#39;t have to, and
less time is devoted to the topic
if everyone adheres to the same style.
The problem is how to approach this Utopia without a long
prescriptive style guide.
</p>

<p>
With Go we take an unusual
approach and let the machine
take care of most formatting issues.
The <code>gofmt</code> program
(also available as <code>go fmt</code>, which
operates at the package level rather than source file level)
reads a Go program
and emits the source in a standard style of indentation
and vertical alignment, retaining and if necessary
reformatting comments.
If you want to know how to handle some new layout
situation, run <code>gofmt</code>; if the answer doesn&#39;t
seem right, rearrange your program (or file a bug about <code>gofmt</code>),
don&#39;t work around it.
</p>

<p>
As an example, there&#39;s no need to spend time lining up
the comments on the fields of a structure.
<code>Gofmt</code> will do that for you.  Given the
declaration
</p>

<pre>type T struct {
    name string // name of the object
    value int // its value
}
</pre>

<p>
<code>gofmt</code> will line up the columns:
</p>

<pre>type T struct {
    name    string // name of the object
    value   int    // its value
}
</pre>

<p>
All Go code in the standard packages has been formatted with <code>gofmt</code>.
</p>


<p>
Some formatting details remain.  Very briefly:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Indentation</dt>
    <dd>We use tabs for indentation and <code>gofmt</code> emits them by default.
    Use spaces only if you must.
    </dd>
    <dt>Line length</dt>
    <dd>
    Go has no line length limit.  Don&#39;t worry about overflowing a punched card.
    If a line feels too long, wrap it and indent with an extra tab.
    </dd>
    <dt>Parentheses</dt>
    <dd>
    Go needs fewer parentheses than C and Java: control structures (<code>if</code>,
    <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>) do not have parentheses in
    their syntax.
    Also, the operator precedence hierarchy is shorter and clearer, so
<pre>x&lt;&lt;8 + y&lt;&lt;16
</pre>
    means what the spacing implies, unlike in the other languages.
    </dd>
</dl>



<p>
Go provides C-style <code>/* */</code> block comments
and C++-style <code>//</code> line comments.
Line comments are the norm;
block comments appear mostly as package comments, but
are useful within an expression or to disable large swaths of code.
</p>

<p>
Comments that appear before top-level declarations, with no intervening newlines,
are considered to document the declaration itself.
These “doc comments” are the primary documentation for a given Go package or command.
For more about doc comments, see “<a href="https://go.dev/doc/comment">Go Doc Comments</a>”.
</p>

<h2 id="names">Names</h2>

<p>
Names are as important in Go as in any other language.
They even have semantic effect:
the visibility of a name outside a package is determined by whether its
first character is upper case.
It&#39;s therefore worth spending a little time talking about naming conventions
in Go programs.
</p>


<h3 id="package-names">Package names</h3>

<p>
When a package is imported, the package name becomes an accessor for the
contents.  After
</p>

<pre>import &#34;bytes&#34;
</pre>

<p>
the importing package can talk about <code>bytes.Buffer</code>.  It&#39;s
helpful if everyone using the package can use the same name to refer to
its contents, which implies that the package name should be good:
short, concise, evocative.  By convention, packages are given
lower case, single-word names; there should be no need for underscores
or mixedCaps.
Err on the side of brevity, since everyone using your
package will be typing that name.
And don&#39;t worry about collisions <i>a priori</i>.
The package name is only the default name for imports; it need not be unique
across all source code, and in the rare case of a collision the
importing package can choose a different name to use locally.
In any case, confusion is rare because the file name in the import
determines just which package is being used.
</p>

<p>
Another convention is that the package name is the base name of
its source directory;
the package in <code>src/encoding/base64</code>
is imported as <code>&#34;encoding/base64&#34;</code> but has name <code>base64</code>,
not <code>encoding_base64</code> and not <code>encodingBase64</code>.
</p>

<p>
The importer of a package will use the name to refer to its contents,
so exported names in the package can use that fact
to avoid repetition.
(Don&#39;t use the <code>import .</code> notation, which can simplify
tests that must run outside the package they are testing, but should otherwise be avoided.)
For instance, the buffered reader type in the <code>bufio</code> package is called <code>Reader</code>,
not <code>BufReader</code>, because users see it as <code>bufio.Reader</code>,
which is a clear, concise name.
Moreover,
because imported entities are always addressed with their package name, <code>bufio.Reader</code>
does not conflict with <code>io.Reader</code>.
Similarly, the function to make new instances of <code>ring.Ring</code>—which
is the definition of a <em>constructor</em> in Go—would
normally be called <code>NewRing</code>, but since
<code>Ring</code> is the only type exported by the package, and since the
package is called <code>ring</code>, it&#39;s called just <code>New</code>,
which clients of the package see as <code>ring.New</code>.
Use the package structure to help you choose good names.
</p>

<p>
Another short example is <code>once.Do</code>;
<code>once.Do(setup)</code> reads well and would not be improved by
writing <code>once.DoOrWaitUntilDone(setup)</code>.
Long names don&#39;t automatically make things more readable.
A helpful doc comment can often be more valuable than an extra long name.
</p>

<h3 id="Getters">Getters</h3>

<p>
Go doesn&#39;t provide automatic support for getters and setters.
There&#39;s nothing wrong with providing getters and setters yourself,
and it&#39;s often appropriate to do so, but it&#39;s neither idiomatic nor necessary
to put <code>Get</code> into the getter&#39;s name.  If you have a field called
<code>owner</code> (lower case, unexported), the getter method should be
called <code>Owner</code> (upper case, exported), not <code>GetOwner</code>.
The use of upper-case names for export provides the hook to discriminate
the field from the method.
A setter function, if needed, will likely be called <code>SetOwner</code>.
Both names read well in practice:
</p>
<pre>owner := obj.Owner()
if owner != user {
    obj.SetOwner(user)
}
</pre>

<h3 id="interface-names">Interface names</h3>

<p>
By convention, one-method interfaces are named by
the method name plus an -er suffix or similar modification
to construct an agent noun: <code>Reader</code>,
<code>Writer</code>, <code>Formatter</code>,
<code>CloseNotifier</code> etc.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of such names and it&#39;s productive to honor them and the function
names they capture.
<code>Read</code>, <code>Write</code>, <code>Close</code>, <code>Flush</code>,
<code>String</code> and so on have
canonical signatures and meanings.  To avoid confusion,
don&#39;t give your method one of those names unless it
has the same signature and meaning.
Conversely, if your type implements a method with the
same meaning as a method on a well-known type,
give it the same name and signature;
call your string-converter method <code>String</code> not <code>ToString</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="mixed-caps">MixedCaps</h3>

<p>
Finally, the convention in Go is to use <code>MixedCaps</code>
or <code>mixedCaps</code> rather than underscores to write
multiword names.
</p>

<h2 id="semicolons">Semicolons</h2>

<p>
Like C, Go&#39;s formal grammar uses semicolons to terminate statements,
but unlike in C, those semicolons do not appear in the source.
Instead the lexer uses a simple rule to insert semicolons automatically
as it scans, so the input text is mostly free of them.
</p>

<p>
The rule is this. If the last token before a newline is an identifier
(which includes words like <code>int</code> and <code>float64</code>),
a basic literal such as a number or string constant, or one of the
tokens
</p>
<pre>break continue fallthrough return ++ -- ) }
</pre>
<p>
the lexer always inserts a semicolon after the token.
This could be summarized as, “if the newline comes
after a token that could end a statement, insert a semicolon”.
</p>

<p>
A semicolon can also be omitted immediately before a closing brace,
so a statement such as
</p>
<pre>    go func() { for { dst &lt;- &lt;-src } }()
</pre>
<p>
needs no semicolons.
Idiomatic Go programs have semicolons only in places such as
<code>for</code> loop clauses, to separate the initializer, condition, and
continuation elements.  They are also necessary to separate multiple
statements on a line, should you write code that way.
</p>

<p>
One consequence of the semicolon insertion rules
is that you cannot put the opening brace of a
control structure (<code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>,
or <code>select</code>) on the next line.  If you do, a semicolon
will be inserted before the brace, which could cause unwanted
effects.  Write them like this
</p>

<pre>if i &lt; f() {
    g()
}
</pre>
<p>
not like this
</p>
<pre>if i &lt; f()  // wrong!
{           // wrong!
    g()
}
</pre>


<h2 id="control-structures">Control structures</h2>

<p>
The control structures of Go are related to those of C but differ
in important ways.
There is no <code>do</code> or <code>while</code> loop, only a
slightly generalized
<code>for</code>;
<code>switch</code> is more flexible;
<code>if</code> and <code>switch</code> accept an optional
initialization statement like that of <code>for</code>;
<code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements
take an optional label to identify what to break or continue;
and there are new control structures including a type switch and a
multiway communications multiplexer, <code>select</code>.
The syntax is also slightly different:
there are no parentheses
and the bodies must always be brace-delimited.
</p>

<h3 id="if">If</h3>

<p>
In Go a simple <code>if</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre>if x &gt; 0 {
    return y
}
</pre>

<p>
Mandatory braces encourage writing simple <code>if</code> statements
on multiple lines.  It&#39;s good style to do so anyway,
especially when the body contains a control statement such as a
<code>return</code> or <code>break</code>.
</p>

<p>
Since <code>if</code> and <code>switch</code> accept an initialization
statement, it&#39;s common to see one used to set up a local variable.
</p>

<pre>if err := file.Chmod(0664); err != nil {
    log.Print(err)
    return err
}
</pre>

<p id="else">
In the Go libraries, you&#39;ll find that
when an <code>if</code> statement doesn&#39;t flow into the next statement—that is,
the body ends in <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>,
<code>goto</code>, or <code>return</code>—the unnecessary
<code>else</code> is omitted.
</p>

<pre>f, err := os.Open(name)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
codeUsing(f)
</pre>

<p>
This is an example of a common situation where code must guard against a
sequence of error conditions.  The code reads well if the
successful flow of control runs down the page, eliminating error cases
as they arise.  Since error cases tend to end in <code>return</code>
statements, the resulting code needs no <code>else</code> statements.
</p>

<pre>f, err := os.Open(name)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
d, err := f.Stat()
if err != nil {
    f.Close()
    return err
}
codeUsing(f, d)
</pre>


<h3 id="redeclaration">Redeclaration and reassignment</h3>

<p>
An aside: The last example in the previous section demonstrates a detail of how the
<code>:=</code> short declaration form works.
The declaration that calls <code>os.Open</code> reads,
</p>

<pre>f, err := os.Open(name)
</pre>

<p>
This statement declares two variables, <code>f</code> and <code>err</code>.
A few lines later, the call to <code>f.Stat</code> reads,
</p>

<pre>d, err := f.Stat()
</pre>

<p>
which looks as if it declares <code>d</code> and <code>err</code>.
Notice, though, that <code>err</code> appears in both statements.
This duplication is legal: <code>err</code> is declared by the first statement,
but only <em>re-assigned</em> in the second.
This means that the call to <code>f.Stat</code> uses the existing
<code>err</code> variable declared above, and just gives it a new value.
</p>

<p>
In a <code>:=</code> declaration a variable <code>v</code> may appear even
if it has already been declared, provided:
</p>

<ul>
<li>this declaration is in the same scope as the existing declaration of <code>v</code>
(if <code>v</code> is already declared in an outer scope, the declaration will create a new variable §),</li>
<li>the corresponding value in the initialization is assignable to <code>v</code>, and</li>
<li>there is at least one other variable that is created by the declaration.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This unusual property is pure pragmatism,
making it easy to use a single <code>err</code> value, for example,
in a long <code>if-else</code> chain.
You&#39;ll see it used often.
</p>

<p>
§ It&#39;s worth noting here that in Go the scope of function parameters and return values
is the same as the function body, even though they appear lexically outside the braces
that enclose the body.
</p>

<h3 id="for">For</h3>

<p>
The Go <code>for</code> loop is similar to—but not the same as—C&#39;s.
It unifies <code>for</code>
and <code>while</code> and there is no <code>do-while</code>.
There are three forms, only one of which has semicolons.
</p>
<pre>// Like a C for
for init; condition; post { }

// Like a C while
for condition { }

// Like a C for(;;)
for { }
</pre>

<p>
Short declarations make it easy to declare the index variable right in the loop.
</p>
<pre>sum := 0
for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
    sum += i
}
</pre>

<p>
If you&#39;re looping over an array, slice, string, or map,
or reading from a channel, a <code>range</code> clause can
manage the loop.
</p>
<pre>for key, value := range oldMap {
    newMap[key] = value
}
</pre>

<p>
If you only need the first item in the range (the key or index), drop the second:
</p>
<pre>for key := range m {
    if key.expired() {
        delete(m, key)
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
If you only need the second item in the range (the value), use the <em>blank identifier</em>, an underscore, to discard the first:
</p>
<pre>sum := 0
for _, value := range array {
    sum += value
}
</pre>

<p>
The blank identifier has many uses, as described in <a href="#blank">a later section</a>.
</p>

<p>
For strings, the <code>range</code> does more work for you, breaking out individual
Unicode code points by parsing the UTF-8.
Erroneous encodings consume one byte and produce the
replacement rune U+FFFD.
(The name (with associated builtin type) <code>rune</code> is Go terminology for a
single Unicode code point.
See <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Rune_literals">the language specification</a>
for details.)
The loop
</p>
<pre>for pos, char := range &#34;日本\x80語&#34; { // \x80 is an illegal UTF-8 encoding
    fmt.Printf(&#34;character %#U starts at byte position %d\n&#34;, char, pos)
}
</pre>
<p>
prints
</p>
<pre>character U+65E5 &#39;日&#39; starts at byte position 0
character U+672C &#39;本&#39; starts at byte position 3
character U+FFFD &#39;�&#39; starts at byte position 6
character U+8A9E &#39;語&#39; starts at byte position 7
</pre>

<p>
Finally, Go has no comma operator and <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>
are statements not expressions.
Thus if you want to run multiple variables in a <code>for</code>
you should use parallel assignment (although that precludes <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>).
</p>
<pre>// Reverse a
for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i &lt; j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
}
</pre>

<h3 id="switch">Switch</h3>

<p>
Go&#39;s <code>switch</code> is more general than C&#39;s.
The expressions need not be constants or even integers,
the cases are evaluated top to bottom until a match is found,
and if the <code>switch</code> has no expression it switches on
<code>true</code>.
It&#39;s therefore possible—and idiomatic—to write an
<code>if</code>-<code>else</code>-<code>if</code>-<code>else</code>
chain as a <code>switch</code>.
</p>

<pre>func unhex(c byte) byte {
    switch {
    case &#39;0&#39; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#39;9&#39;:
        return c - &#39;0&#39;
    case &#39;a&#39; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#39;f&#39;:
        return c - &#39;a&#39; + 10
    case &#39;A&#39; &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#39;F&#39;:
        return c - &#39;A&#39; + 10
    }
    return 0
}
</pre>

<p>
There is no automatic fall through, but cases can be presented
in comma-separated lists.
</p>
<pre>func shouldEscape(c byte) bool {
    switch c {
    case &#39; &#39;, &#39;?&#39;, &#39;&amp;&#39;, &#39;=&#39;, &#39;#&#39;, &#39;+&#39;, &#39;%&#39;:
        return true
    }
    return false
}
</pre>

<p>
Although they are not nearly as common in Go as some other C-like
languages, <code>break</code> statements can be used to terminate
a <code>switch</code> early.
Sometimes, though, it&#39;s necessary to break out of a surrounding loop,
not the switch, and in Go that can be accomplished by putting a label
on the loop and &#34;breaking&#34; to that label.
This example shows both uses.
</p>

<pre>Loop:
    for n := 0; n &lt; len(src); n += size {
        switch {
        case src[n] &lt; sizeOne:
            if validateOnly {
                break
            }
            size = 1
            update(src[n])

        case src[n] &lt; sizeTwo:
            if n+1 &gt;= len(src) {
                err = errShortInput
                break Loop
            }
            if validateOnly {
                break
            }
            size = 2
            update(src[n] + src[n+1]&lt;&lt;shift)
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
Of course, the <code>continue</code> statement also accepts an optional label
but it applies only to loops.
</p>

<p>
To close this section, here&#39;s a comparison routine for byte slices that uses two
<code>switch</code> statements:
</p>
<pre>// Compare returns an integer comparing the two byte slices,
// lexicographically.
// The result will be 0 if a == b, -1 if a &lt; b, and +1 if a &gt; b
func Compare(a, b []byte) int {
    for i := 0; i &lt; len(a) &amp;&amp; i &lt; len(b); i++ {
        switch {
        case a[i] &gt; b[i]:
            return 1
        case a[i] &lt; b[i]:
            return -1
        }
    }
    switch {
    case len(a) &gt; len(b):
        return 1
    case len(a) &lt; len(b):
        return -1
    }
    return 0
}
</pre>

<h3 id="type_switch">Type switch</h3>

<p>
A switch can also be used to discover the dynamic type of an interface
variable.  Such a <em>type switch</em> uses the syntax of a type
assertion with the keyword <code>type</code> inside the parentheses.
If the switch declares a variable in the expression, the variable will
have the corresponding type in each clause.
It&#39;s also idiomatic to reuse the name in such cases, in effect declaring
a new variable with the same name but a different type in each case.
</p>
<pre>var t interface{}
t = functionOfSomeType()
switch t := t.(type) {
default:
    fmt.Printf(&#34;unexpected type %T\n&#34;, t)     // %T prints whatever type t has
case bool:
    fmt.Printf(&#34;boolean %t\n&#34;, t)             // t has type bool
case int:
    fmt.Printf(&#34;integer %d\n&#34;, t)             // t has type int
case *bool:
    fmt.Printf(&#34;pointer to boolean %t\n&#34;, *t) // t has type *bool
case *int:
    fmt.Printf(&#34;pointer to integer %d\n&#34;, *t) // t has type *int
}
</pre>

<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>

<h3 id="multiple-returns">Multiple return values</h3>

<p>
One of Go&#39;s unusual features is that functions and methods
can return multiple values.  This form can be used to
improve on a couple of clumsy idioms in C programs: in-band
error returns such as <code>-1</code> for <code>EOF</code>
and modifying an argument passed by address.
</p>

<p>
In C, a write error is signaled by a negative count with the
error code secreted away in a volatile location.
In Go, <code>Write</code>
can return a count <i>and</i> an error: “Yes, you wrote some
bytes but not all of them because you filled the device”.
The signature of the <code>Write</code> method on files from
package <code>os</code> is:
</p>

<pre>func (file *File) Write(b []byte) (n int, err error)
</pre>

<p>
and as the documentation says, it returns the number of bytes
written and a non-nil <code>error</code> when <code>n</code>
<code>!=</code> <code>len(b)</code>.
This is a common style; see the section on error handling for more examples.
</p>

<p>
A similar approach obviates the need to pass a pointer to a return
value to simulate a reference parameter.
Here&#39;s a simple-minded function to
grab a number from a position in a byte slice, returning the number
and the next position.
</p>

<pre>func nextInt(b []byte, i int) (int, int) {
    for ; i &lt; len(b) &amp;&amp; !isDigit(b[i]); i++ {
    }
    x := 0
    for ; i &lt; len(b) &amp;&amp; isDigit(b[i]); i++ {
        x = x*10 + int(b[i]) - &#39;0&#39;
    }
    return x, i
}
</pre>

<p>
You could use it to scan the numbers in an input slice <code>b</code> like this:
</p>

<pre>    for i := 0; i &lt; len(b); {
        x, i = nextInt(b, i)
        fmt.Println(x)
    }
</pre>

<h3 id="named-results">Named result parameters</h3>

<p>
The return or result &#34;parameters&#34; of a Go function can be given names and
used as regular variables, just like the incoming parameters.
When named, they are initialized to the zero values for their types when
the function begins; if the function executes a <code>return</code> statement
with no arguments, the current values of the result parameters are
used as the returned values.
</p>

<p>
The names are not mandatory but they can make code shorter and clearer:
they&#39;re documentation.
If we name the results of <code>nextInt</code> it becomes
obvious which returned <code>int</code>
is which.
</p>

<pre>func nextInt(b []byte, pos int) (value, nextPos int) {
</pre>

<p>
Because named results are initialized and tied to an unadorned return, they can simplify
as well as clarify.  Here&#39;s a version
of <code>io.ReadFull</code> that uses them well:
</p>

<pre>func ReadFull(r Reader, buf []byte) (n int, err error) {
    for len(buf) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; err == nil {
        var nr int
        nr, err = r.Read(buf)
        n += nr
        buf = buf[nr:]
    }
    return
}
</pre>

<h3 id="defer">Defer</h3>

<p>
Go&#39;s <code>defer</code> statement schedules a function call (the
<i>deferred</i> function) to be run immediately before the function
executing the <code>defer</code> returns.  It&#39;s an unusual but
effective way to deal with situations such as resources that must be
released regardless of which path a function takes to return.  The
canonical examples are unlocking a mutex or closing a file.
</p>

<pre>// Contents returns the file&#39;s contents as a string.
func Contents(filename string) (string, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return &#34;&#34;, err
    }
    defer f.Close()  // f.Close will run when we&#39;re finished.

    var result []byte
    buf := make([]byte, 100)
    for {
        n, err := f.Read(buf[0:])
        result = append(result, buf[0:n]...) // append is discussed later.
        if err != nil {
            if err == io.EOF {
                break
            }
            return &#34;&#34;, err  // f will be closed if we return here.
        }
    }
    return string(result), nil // f will be closed if we return here.
}
</pre>

<p>
Deferring a call to a function such as <code>Close</code> has two advantages.  First, it
guarantees that you will never forget to close the file, a mistake
that&#39;s easy to make if you later edit the function to add a new return
path.  Second, it means that the close sits near the open,
which is much clearer than placing it at the end of the function.
</p>

<p>
The arguments to the deferred function (which include the receiver if
the function is a method) are evaluated when the <i>defer</i>
executes, not when the <i>call</i> executes.  Besides avoiding worries
about variables changing values as the function executes, this means
that a single deferred call site can defer multiple function
executions.  Here&#39;s a silly example.
</p>

<pre>for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ {
    defer fmt.Printf(&#34;%d &#34;, i)
}
</pre>

<p>
Deferred functions are executed in LIFO order, so this code will cause
<code>4 3 2 1 0</code> to be printed when the function returns.  A
more plausible example is a simple way to trace function execution
through the program.  We could write a couple of simple tracing
routines like this:
</p>

<pre>func trace(s string)   { fmt.Println(&#34;entering:&#34;, s) }
func untrace(s string) { fmt.Println(&#34;leaving:&#34;, s) }

// Use them like this:
func a() {
    trace(&#34;a&#34;)
    defer untrace(&#34;a&#34;)
    // do something....
}
</pre>

<p>
We can do better by exploiting the fact that arguments to deferred
functions are evaluated when the <code>defer</code> executes.  The
tracing routine can set up the argument to the untracing routine.
This example:
</p>

<pre>func trace(s string) string {
    fmt.Println(&#34;entering:&#34;, s)
    return s
}

func un(s string) {
    fmt.Println(&#34;leaving:&#34;, s)
}

func a() {
    defer un(trace(&#34;a&#34;))
    fmt.Println(&#34;in a&#34;)
}

func b() {
    defer un(trace(&#34;b&#34;))
    fmt.Println(&#34;in b&#34;)
    a()
}

func main() {
    b()
}
</pre>

<p>
prints
</p>

<pre>entering: b
in b
entering: a
in a
leaving: a
leaving: b
</pre>

<p>
For programmers accustomed to block-level resource management from
other languages, <code>defer</code> may seem peculiar, but its most
interesting and powerful applications come precisely from the fact
that it&#39;s not block-based but function-based.  In the section on
<code>panic</code> and <code>recover</code> we&#39;ll see another
example of its possibilities.
</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<h3 id="allocation_new">Allocation with <code>new</code></h3>

<p>
Go has two allocation primitives, the built-in functions
<code>new</code> and <code>make</code>.
They do different things and apply to different types, which can be confusing,
but the rules are simple.
Let&#39;s talk about <code>new</code> first.
It&#39;s a built-in function that allocates memory, but unlike its namesakes
in some other languages it does not <em>initialize</em> the memory,
it only <em>zeros</em> it.
That is,
<code>new(T)</code> allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type
<code>T</code> and returns its address, a value of type <code>*T</code>.
In Go terminology, it returns a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of type
<code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>
Since the memory returned by <code>new</code> is zeroed, it&#39;s helpful to arrange
when designing your data structures that the
zero value of each type can be used without further initialization.  This means a user of
the data structure can create one with <code>new</code> and get right to
work.
For example, the documentation for <code>bytes.Buffer</code> states that
&#34;the zero value for <code>Buffer</code> is an empty buffer ready to use.&#34;
Similarly, <code>sync.Mutex</code> does not
have an explicit constructor or <code>Init</code> method.
Instead, the zero value for a <code>sync.Mutex</code>
is defined to be an unlocked mutex.
</p>

<p>
The zero-value-is-useful property works transitively. Consider this type declaration.
</p>

<pre>type SyncedBuffer struct {
    lock    sync.Mutex
    buffer  bytes.Buffer
}
</pre>

<p>
Values of type <code>SyncedBuffer</code> are also ready to use immediately upon allocation
or just declaration.  In the next snippet, both <code>p</code> and <code>v</code> will work
correctly without further arrangement.
</p>

<pre>p := new(SyncedBuffer)  // type *SyncedBuffer
var v SyncedBuffer      // type  SyncedBuffer
</pre>

<h3 id="composite_literals">Constructors and composite literals</h3>

<p>
Sometimes the zero value isn&#39;t good enough and an initializing
constructor is necessary, as in this example derived from
package <code>os</code>.
</p>

<pre>func NewFile(fd int, name string) *File {
    if fd &lt; 0 {
        return nil
    }
    f := new(File)
    f.fd = fd
    f.name = name
    f.dirinfo = nil
    f.nepipe = 0
    return f
}
</pre>

<p>
There&#39;s a lot of boilerplate in there.  We can simplify it
using a <i>composite literal</i>, which is
an expression that creates a
new instance each time it is evaluated.
</p>

<pre>func NewFile(fd int, name string) *File {
    if fd &lt; 0 {
        return nil
    }
    f := File{fd, name, nil, 0}
    return &amp;f
}
</pre>

<p>
Note that, unlike in C, it&#39;s perfectly OK to return the address of a local variable;
the storage associated with the variable survives after the function
returns.
In fact, taking the address of a composite literal
allocates a fresh instance each time it is evaluated,
so we can combine these last two lines.
</p>

<pre>    return &amp;File{fd, name, nil, 0}
</pre>

<p>
The fields of a composite literal are laid out in order and must all be present.
However, by labeling the elements explicitly as <i>field</i><code>:</code><i>value</i>
pairs, the initializers can appear in any
order, with the missing ones left as their respective zero values.  Thus we could say
</p>

<pre>    return &amp;File{fd: fd, name: name}
</pre>

<p>
As a limiting case, if a composite literal contains no fields at all, it creates
a zero value for the type.  The expressions <code>new(File)</code> and <code>&amp;File{}</code> are equivalent.
</p>

<p>
Composite literals can also be created for arrays, slices, and maps,
with the field labels being indices or map keys as appropriate.
In these examples, the initializations work regardless of the values of <code>Enone</code>,
<code>Eio</code>, and <code>Einval</code>, as long as they are distinct.
</p>

<pre>a := [...]string   {Enone: &#34;no error&#34;, Eio: &#34;Eio&#34;, Einval: &#34;invalid argument&#34;}
s := []string      {Enone: &#34;no error&#34;, Eio: &#34;Eio&#34;, Einval: &#34;invalid argument&#34;}
m := map[int]string{Enone: &#34;no error&#34;, Eio: &#34;Eio&#34;, Einval: &#34;invalid argument&#34;}
</pre>

<h3 id="allocation_make">Allocation with <code>make</code></h3>

<p>
Back to allocation.
The built-in function <code>make(T, </code><i>args</i><code>)</code> serves
a purpose different from <code>new(T)</code>.
It creates slices, maps, and channels only, and it returns an <em>initialized</em>
(not <em>zeroed</em>)
value of type <code>T</code> (not <code>*T</code>).
The reason for the distinction
is that these three types represent, under the covers, references to data structures that
must be initialized before use.
A slice, for example, is a three-item descriptor
containing a pointer to the data (inside an array), the length, and the
capacity, and until those items are initialized, the slice is <code>nil</code>.
For slices, maps, and channels,
<code>make</code> initializes the internal data structure and prepares
the value for use.
For instance,
</p>

<pre>make([]int, 10, 100)
</pre>

<p>
allocates an array of 100 ints and then creates a slice
structure with length 10 and a capacity of 100 pointing at the first
10 elements of the array.
(When making a slice, the capacity can be omitted; see the section on slices
for more information.)
In contrast, <code>new([]int)</code> returns a pointer to a newly allocated, zeroed slice
structure, that is, a pointer to a <code>nil</code> slice value.
</p>

<p>
These examples illustrate the difference between <code>new</code> and
<code>make</code>.
</p>

<pre>var p *[]int = new([]int)       // allocates slice structure; *p == nil; rarely useful
var v  []int = make([]int, 100) // the slice v now refers to a new array of 100 ints

// Unnecessarily complex:
var p *[]int = new([]int)
*p = make([]int, 100, 100)

// Idiomatic:
v := make([]int, 100)
</pre>

<p>
Remember that <code>make</code> applies only to maps, slices and channels
and does not return a pointer.
To obtain an explicit pointer allocate with <code>new</code> or take the address
of a variable explicitly.
</p>

<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>

<p>
Arrays are useful when planning the detailed layout of memory and sometimes
can help avoid allocation, but primarily
they are a building block for slices, the subject of the next section.
To lay the foundation for that topic, here are a few words about arrays.
</p>

<p>
There are major differences between the ways arrays work in Go and C.
In Go,
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Arrays are values. Assigning one array to another copies all the elements.
</li>
<li>
In particular, if you pass an array to a function, it
will receive a <i>copy</i> of the array, not a pointer to it.
</li><li>
The size of an array is part of its type.  The types <code>[10]int</code>
and <code>[20]int</code> are distinct.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The value property can be useful but also expensive; if you want C-like behavior and efficiency,
you can pass a pointer to the array.
</p>

<pre>func Sum(a *[3]float64) (sum float64) {
    for _, v := range *a {
        sum += v
    }
    return
}

array := [...]float64{7.0, 8.5, 9.1}
x := Sum(&amp;array)  // Note the explicit address-of operator
</pre>

<p>
But even this style isn&#39;t idiomatic Go.
Use slices instead.
</p>

<h3 id="slices">Slices</h3>

<p>
Slices wrap arrays to give a more general, powerful, and convenient
interface to sequences of data.  Except for items with explicit
dimension such as transformation matrices, most array programming in
Go is done with slices rather than simple arrays.
</p>
<p>
Slices hold references to an underlying array, and if you assign one
slice to another, both refer to the same array.
If a function takes a slice argument, changes it makes to
the elements of the slice will be visible to the caller, analogous to
passing a pointer to the underlying array.  A <code>Read</code>
function can therefore accept a slice argument rather than a pointer
and a count; the length within the slice sets an upper
limit of how much data to read.  Here is the signature of the
<code>Read</code> method of the <code>File</code> type in package
<code>os</code>:
</p>
<pre>func (f *File) Read(buf []byte) (n int, err error)
</pre>
<p>
The method returns the number of bytes read and an error value, if
any.
To read into the first 32 bytes of a larger buffer
<code>buf</code>, <i>slice</i> (here used as a verb) the buffer.
</p>
<pre>    n, err := f.Read(buf[0:32])
</pre>
<p>
Such slicing is common and efficient.  In fact, leaving efficiency aside for
the moment, the following snippet would also read the first 32 bytes of the buffer.
</p>
<pre>    var n int
    var err error
    for i := 0; i &lt; 32; i++ {
        nbytes, e := f.Read(buf[i:i+1])  // Read one byte.
        n += nbytes
        if nbytes == 0 || e != nil {
            err = e
            break
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
The length of a slice may be changed as long as it still fits within
the limits of the underlying array; just assign it to a slice of
itself.  The <i>capacity</i> of a slice, accessible by the built-in
function <code>cap</code>, reports the maximum length the slice may
assume.  Here is a function to append data to a slice.  If the data
exceeds the capacity, the slice is reallocated.  The
resulting slice is returned.  The function uses the fact that
<code>len</code> and <code>cap</code> are legal when applied to the
<code>nil</code> slice, and return 0.
</p>
<pre>func Append(slice, data []byte) []byte {
    l := len(slice)
    if l + len(data) &gt; cap(slice) {  // reallocate
        // Allocate double what&#39;s needed, for future growth.
        newSlice := make([]byte, (l+len(data))*2)
        // The copy function is predeclared and works for any slice type.
        copy(newSlice, slice)
        slice = newSlice
    }
    slice = slice[0:l+len(data)]
    copy(slice[l:], data)
    return slice
}
</pre>
<p>
We must return the slice afterwards because, although <code>Append</code>
can modify the elements of <code>slice</code>, the slice itself (the run-time data
structure holding the pointer, length, and capacity) is passed by value.
</p>

<p>
The idea of appending to a slice is so useful it&#39;s captured by the
<code>append</code> built-in function.  To understand that function&#39;s
design, though, we need a little more information, so we&#39;ll return
to it later.
</p>

<h3 id="two_dimensional_slices">Two-dimensional slices</h3>

<p>
Go&#39;s arrays and slices are one-dimensional.
To create the equivalent of a 2D array or slice, it is necessary to define an array-of-arrays
or slice-of-slices, like this:
</p>

<pre>type Transform [3][3]float64  // A 3x3 array, really an array of arrays.
type LinesOfText [][]byte     // A slice of byte slices.
</pre>

<p>
Because slices are variable-length, it is possible to have each inner
slice be a different length.
That can be a common situation, as in our <code>LinesOfText</code>
example: each line has an independent length.
</p>

<pre>text := LinesOfText{
    []byte(&#34;Now is the time&#34;),
    []byte(&#34;for all good gophers&#34;),
    []byte(&#34;to bring some fun to the party.&#34;),
}
</pre>

<p>
Sometimes it&#39;s necessary to allocate a 2D slice, a situation that can arise when
processing scan lines of pixels, for instance.
There are two ways to achieve this.
One is to allocate each slice independently; the other
is to allocate a single array and point the individual slices into it.
Which to use depends on your application.
If the slices might grow or shrink, they should be allocated independently
to avoid overwriting the next line; if not, it can be more efficient to construct
the object with a single allocation.
For reference, here are sketches of the two methods.
First, a line at a time:
</p>

<pre>// Allocate the top-level slice.
picture := make([][]uint8, YSize) // One row per unit of y.
// Loop over the rows, allocating the slice for each row.
for i := range picture {
    picture[i] = make([]uint8, XSize)
}
</pre>

<p>
And now as one allocation, sliced into lines:
</p>

<pre>// Allocate the top-level slice, the same as before.
picture := make([][]uint8, YSize) // One row per unit of y.
// Allocate one large slice to hold all the pixels.
pixels := make([]uint8, XSize*YSize) // Has type []uint8 even though picture is [][]uint8.
// Loop over the rows, slicing each row from the front of the remaining pixels slice.
for i := range picture {
    picture[i], pixels = pixels[:XSize], pixels[XSize:]
}
</pre>

<h3 id="maps">Maps</h3>

<p>
Maps are a convenient and powerful built-in data structure that associate
values of one type (the <em>key</em>) with values of another type
(the <em>element</em> or <em>value</em>).
The key can be of any type for which the equality operator is defined,
such as integers,
floating point and complex numbers,
strings, pointers, interfaces (as long as the dynamic type
supports equality), structs and arrays.
Slices cannot be used as map keys,
because equality is not defined on them.
Like slices, maps hold references to an underlying data structure.
If you pass a map to a function
that changes the contents of the map, the changes will be visible
in the caller.
</p>
<p>
Maps can be constructed using the usual composite literal syntax
with colon-separated key-value pairs,
so it&#39;s easy to build them during initialization.
</p>
<pre>var timeZone = map[string]int{
    &#34;UTC&#34;:  0*60*60,
    &#34;EST&#34;: -5*60*60,
    &#34;CST&#34;: -6*60*60,
    &#34;MST&#34;: -7*60*60,
    &#34;PST&#34;: -8*60*60,
}
</pre>
<p>
Assigning and fetching map values looks syntactically just like
doing the same for arrays and slices except that the index doesn&#39;t
need to be an integer.
</p>
<pre>offset := timeZone[&#34;EST&#34;]
</pre>
<p>
An attempt to fetch a map value with a key that
is not present in the map will return the zero value for the type
of the entries
in the map.  For instance, if the map contains integers, looking
up a non-existent key will return <code>0</code>.
A set can be implemented as a map with value type <code>bool</code>.
Set the map entry to <code>true</code> to put the value in the set, and then
test it by simple indexing.
</p>
<pre>attended := map[string]bool{
    &#34;Ann&#34;: true,
    &#34;Joe&#34;: true,
    ...
}

if attended[person] { // will be false if person is not in the map
    fmt.Println(person, &#34;was at the meeting&#34;)
}
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes you need to distinguish a missing entry from
a zero value.  Is there an entry for <code>&#34;UTC&#34;</code>
or is that 0 because it&#39;s not in the map at all?
You can discriminate with a form of multiple assignment.
</p>
<pre>var seconds int
var ok bool
seconds, ok = timeZone[tz]
</pre>
<p>
For obvious reasons this is called the “comma ok” idiom.
In this example, if <code>tz</code> is present, <code>seconds</code>
will be set appropriately and <code>ok</code> will be true; if not,
<code>seconds</code> will be set to zero and <code>ok</code> will
be false.
Here&#39;s a function that puts it together with a nice error report:
</p>
<pre>func offset(tz string) int {
    if seconds, ok := timeZone[tz]; ok {
        return seconds
    }
    log.Println(&#34;unknown time zone:&#34;, tz)
    return 0
}
</pre>
<p>
To test for presence in the map without worrying about the actual value,
you can use the <a href="#blank">blank identifier</a> (<code>_</code>)
in place of the usual variable for the value.
</p>
<pre>_, present := timeZone[tz]
</pre>
<p>
To delete a map entry, use the <code>delete</code>
built-in function, whose arguments are the map and the key to be deleted.
It&#39;s safe to do this even if the key is already absent
from the map.
</p>
<pre>delete(timeZone, &#34;PDT&#34;)  // Now on Standard Time
</pre>

<h3 id="printing">Printing</h3>

<p>
Formatted printing in Go uses a style similar to C&#39;s <code>printf</code>
family but is richer and more general. The functions live in the <code>fmt</code>
package and have capitalized names: <code>fmt.Printf</code>, <code>fmt.Fprintf</code>,
<code>fmt.Sprintf</code> and so on.  The string functions (<code>Sprintf</code> etc.)
return a string rather than filling in a provided buffer.
</p>
<p>
You don&#39;t need to provide a format string.  For each of <code>Printf</code>,
<code>Fprintf</code> and <code>Sprintf</code> there is another pair
of functions, for instance <code>Print</code> and <code>Println</code>.
These functions do not take a format string but instead generate a default
format for each argument. The <code>Println</code> versions also insert a blank
between arguments and append a newline to the output while
the <code>Print</code> versions add blanks only if the operand on neither side is a string.
In this example each line produces the same output.
</p>
<pre>fmt.Printf(&#34;Hello %d\n&#34;, 23)
fmt.Fprint(os.Stdout, &#34;Hello &#34;, 23, &#34;\n&#34;)
fmt.Println(&#34;Hello&#34;, 23)
fmt.Println(fmt.Sprint(&#34;Hello &#34;, 23))
</pre>
<p>
The formatted print functions <code>fmt.Fprint</code>
and friends take as a first argument any object
that implements the <code>io.Writer</code> interface; the variables <code>os.Stdout</code>
and <code>os.Stderr</code> are familiar instances.
</p>
<p>
Here things start to diverge from C.  First, the numeric formats such as <code>%d</code>
do not take flags for signedness or size; instead, the printing routines use the
type of the argument to decide these properties.
</p>
<pre>var x uint64 = 1&lt;&lt;64 - 1
fmt.Printf(&#34;%d %x; %d %x\n&#34;, x, x, int64(x), int64(x))
</pre>
<p>
prints
</p>
<pre>18446744073709551615 ffffffffffffffff; -1 -1
</pre>
<p>
If you just want the default conversion, such as decimal for integers, you can use
the catchall format <code>%v</code> (for “value”); the result is exactly
what <code>Print</code> and <code>Println</code> would produce.
Moreover, that format can print <em>any</em> value, even arrays, slices, structs, and
maps.  Here is a print statement for the time zone map defined in the previous section.
</p>
<pre>fmt.Printf(&#34;%v\n&#34;, timeZone)  // or just fmt.Println(timeZone)
</pre>
<p>
which gives output:
</p>
<pre>map[CST:-21600 EST:-18000 MST:-25200 PST:-28800 UTC:0]
</pre>
<p>
For maps, <code>Printf</code> and friends sort the output lexicographically by key.
</p>
<p>
When printing a struct, the modified format <code>%+v</code> annotates the
fields of the structure with their names, and for any value the alternate
format <code>%#v</code> prints the value in full Go syntax.
</p>
<pre>type T struct {
    a int
    b float64
    c string
}
t := &amp;T{ 7, -2.35, &#34;abc\tdef&#34; }
fmt.Printf(&#34;%v\n&#34;, t)
fmt.Printf(&#34;%+v\n&#34;, t)
fmt.Printf(&#34;%#v\n&#34;, t)
fmt.Printf(&#34;%#v\n&#34;, timeZone)
</pre>
<p>
prints
</p>
<pre>&amp;{7 -2.35 abc   def}
&amp;{a:7 b:-2.35 c:abc     def}
&amp;main.T{a:7, b:-2.35, c:&#34;abc\tdef&#34;}
map[string]int{&#34;CST&#34;:-21600, &#34;EST&#34;:-18000, &#34;MST&#34;:-25200, &#34;PST&#34;:-28800, &#34;UTC&#34;:0}
</pre>
<p>
(Note the ampersands.)
That quoted string format is also available through <code>%q</code> when
applied to a value of type <code>string</code> or <code>[]byte</code>.
The alternate format <code>%#q</code> will use backquotes instead if possible.
(The <code>%q</code> format also applies to integers and runes, producing a
single-quoted rune constant.)
Also, <code>%x</code> works on strings, byte arrays and byte slices as well as
on integers, generating a long hexadecimal string, and with
a space in the format (<code>% x</code>) it puts spaces between the bytes.
</p>
<p>
Another handy format is <code>%T</code>, which prints the <em>type</em> of a value.
</p>
<pre>fmt.Printf(&#34;%T\n&#34;, timeZone)
</pre>
<p>
prints
</p>
<pre>map[string]int
</pre>
<p>
If you want to control the default format for a custom type, all that&#39;s required is to define
a method with the signature <code>String() string</code> on the type.
For our simple type <code>T</code>, that might look like this.
</p>
<pre>func (t *T) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%d/%g/%q&#34;, t.a, t.b, t.c)
}
fmt.Printf(&#34;%v\n&#34;, t)
</pre>
<p>
to print in the format
</p>
<pre>7/-2.35/&#34;abc\tdef&#34;
</pre>
<p>
(If you need to print <em>values</em> of type <code>T</code> as well as pointers to <code>T</code>,
the receiver for <code>String</code> must be of value type; this example used a pointer because
that&#39;s more efficient and idiomatic for struct types.
See the section below on <a href="#pointers_vs_values">pointers vs. value receivers</a> for more information.)
</p>

<p>
Our <code>String</code> method is able to call <code>Sprintf</code> because the
print routines are fully reentrant and can be wrapped this way.
There is one important detail to understand about this approach,
however: don&#39;t construct a <code>String</code> method by calling
<code>Sprintf</code> in a way that will recur into your <code>String</code>
method indefinitely.  This can happen if the <code>Sprintf</code>
call attempts to print the receiver directly as a string, which in
turn will invoke the method again.  It&#39;s a common and easy mistake
to make, as this example shows.
</p>

<pre>type MyString string

func (m MyString) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;MyString=%s&#34;, m) // Error: will recur forever.
}
</pre>

<p>
It&#39;s also easy to fix: convert the argument to the basic string type, which does not have the
method.
</p>

<pre>type MyString string
func (m MyString) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;MyString=%s&#34;, string(m)) // OK: note conversion.
}
</pre>

<p>
In the <a href="#initialization">initialization section</a> we&#39;ll see another technique that avoids this recursion.
</p>

<p>
Another printing technique is to pass a print routine&#39;s arguments directly to another such routine.
The signature of <code>Printf</code> uses the type <code>...interface{}</code>
for its final argument to specify that an arbitrary number of parameters (of arbitrary type)
can appear after the format.
</p>
<pre>func Printf(format string, v ...interface{}) (n int, err error) {
</pre>
<p>
Within the function <code>Printf</code>, <code>v</code> acts like a variable of type
<code>[]interface{}</code> but if it is passed to another variadic function, it acts like
a regular list of arguments.
Here is the implementation of the
function <code>log.Println</code> we used above. It passes its arguments directly to
<code>fmt.Sprintln</code> for the actual formatting.
</p>
<pre>// Println prints to the standard logger in the manner of fmt.Println.
func Println(v ...interface{}) {
    std.Output(2, fmt.Sprintln(v...))  // Output takes parameters (int, string)
}
</pre>
<p>
We write <code>...</code> after <code>v</code> in the nested call to <code>Sprintln</code> to tell the
compiler to treat <code>v</code> as a list of arguments; otherwise it would just pass
<code>v</code> as a single slice argument.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s even more to printing than we&#39;ve covered here.  See the <code>godoc</code> documentation
for package <code>fmt</code> for the details.
</p>
<p>
By the way, a <code>...</code> parameter can be of a specific type, for instance <code>...int</code>
for a min function that chooses the least of a list of integers:
</p>
<pre>func Min(a ...int) int {
    min := int(^uint(0) &gt;&gt; 1)  // largest int
    for _, i := range a {
        if i &lt; min {
            min = i
        }
    }
    return min
}
</pre>

<h3 id="append">Append</h3>
<p>
Now we have the missing piece we needed to explain the design of
the <code>append</code> built-in function.  The signature of <code>append</code>
is different from our custom <code>Append</code> function above.
Schematically, it&#39;s like this:
</p>
<pre>func append(slice []<i>T</i>, elements ...<i>T</i>) []<i>T</i>
</pre>
<p>
where <i>T</i> is a placeholder for any given type.  You can&#39;t
actually write a function in Go where the type <code>T</code>
is determined by the caller.
That&#39;s why <code>append</code> is built in: it needs support from the
compiler.
</p>
<p>
What <code>append</code> does is append the elements to the end of
the slice and return the result.  The result needs to be returned
because, as with our hand-written <code>Append</code>, the underlying
array may change.  This simple example
</p>
<pre>x := []int{1,2,3}
x = append(x, 4, 5, 6)
fmt.Println(x)
</pre>
<p>
prints <code>[1 2 3 4 5 6]</code>.  So <code>append</code> works a
little like <code>Printf</code>, collecting an arbitrary number of
arguments.
</p>
<p>
But what if we wanted to do what our <code>Append</code> does and
append a slice to a slice?  Easy: use <code>...</code> at the call
site, just as we did in the call to <code>Output</code> above.  This
snippet produces identical output to the one above.
</p>
<pre>x := []int{1,2,3}
y := []int{4,5,6}
x = append(x, y...)
fmt.Println(x)
</pre>
<p>
Without that <code>...</code>, it wouldn&#39;t compile because the types
would be wrong; <code>y</code> is not of type <code>int</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

<p>
Although it doesn&#39;t look superficially very different from
initialization in C or C++, initialization in Go is more powerful.
Complex structures can be built during initialization and the ordering
issues among initialized objects, even among different packages, are handled
correctly.
</p>

<h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>

<p>
Constants in Go are just that—constant.
They are created at compile time, even when defined as
locals in functions,
and can only be numbers, characters (runes), strings or booleans.
Because of the compile-time restriction, the expressions
that define them must be constant expressions,
evaluatable by the compiler.  For instance,
<code>1&lt;&lt;3</code> is a constant expression, while
<code>math.Sin(math.Pi/4)</code> is not because
the function call to <code>math.Sin</code> needs
to happen at run time.
</p>

<p>
In Go, enumerated constants are created using the <code>iota</code>
enumerator.  Since <code>iota</code> can be part of an expression and
expressions can be implicitly repeated, it is easy to build intricate
sets of values.
</p>
<div>

<pre>type ByteSize float64

const (
    _           = iota 
    KB ByteSize = 1 &lt;&lt; (10 * iota)
    MB
    GB
    TB
    PB
    EB
    ZB
    YB
)
</pre>
</div>


<p>
The ability to attach a method such as <code>String</code> to any
user-defined type makes it possible for arbitrary values to format themselves
automatically for printing.
Although you&#39;ll see it most often applied to structs, this technique is also useful for
scalar types such as floating-point types like <code>ByteSize</code>.
</p>
<div>

<pre>func (b ByteSize) String() string {
    switch {
    case b &gt;= YB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fYB&#34;, b/YB)
    case b &gt;= ZB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fZB&#34;, b/ZB)
    case b &gt;= EB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fEB&#34;, b/EB)
    case b &gt;= PB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fPB&#34;, b/PB)
    case b &gt;= TB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fTB&#34;, b/TB)
    case b &gt;= GB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fGB&#34;, b/GB)
    case b &gt;= MB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fMB&#34;, b/MB)
    case b &gt;= KB:
        return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fKB&#34;, b/KB)
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf(&#34;%.2fB&#34;, b)
}
</pre>
</div>


<p>
The expression <code>YB</code> prints as <code>1.00YB</code>,
while <code>ByteSize(1e13)</code> prints as <code>9.09TB</code>.
</p>

<p>
The use here of <code>Sprintf</code>
to implement <code>ByteSize</code>&#39;s <code>String</code> method is safe
(avoids recurring indefinitely) not because of a conversion but
because it calls <code>Sprintf</code> with <code>%f</code>,
which is not a string format: <code>Sprintf</code> will only call
the <code>String</code> method when it wants a string, and <code>%f</code>
wants a floating-point value.
</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>
Variables can be initialized just like constants but the
initializer can be a general expression computed at run time.
</p>
<pre>var (
    home   = os.Getenv(&#34;HOME&#34;)
    user   = os.Getenv(&#34;USER&#34;)
    gopath = os.Getenv(&#34;GOPATH&#34;)
)
</pre>

<h3 id="init">The init function</h3>

<p>
Finally, each source file can define its own niladic <code>init</code> function to
set up whatever state is required.  (Actually each file can have multiple
<code>init</code> functions.)
And finally means finally: <code>init</code> is called after all the
variable declarations in the package have evaluated their initializers,
and those are evaluated only after all the imported packages have been
initialized.
</p>
<p>
Besides initializations that cannot be expressed as declarations,
a common use of <code>init</code> functions is to verify or repair
correctness of the program state before real execution begins.
</p>

<pre>func init() {
    if user == &#34;&#34; {
        log.Fatal(&#34;$USER not set&#34;)
    }
    if home == &#34;&#34; {
        home = &#34;/home/&#34; + user
    }
    if gopath == &#34;&#34; {
        gopath = home + &#34;/go&#34;
    }
    // gopath may be overridden by --gopath flag on command line.
    flag.StringVar(&amp;gopath, &#34;gopath&#34;, gopath, &#34;override default GOPATH&#34;)
}
</pre>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<h3 id="pointers_vs_values">Pointers vs. Values</h3>
<p>
As we saw with <code>ByteSize</code>,
methods can be defined for any named type (except a pointer or an interface);
the receiver does not have to be a struct.
</p>
<p>
In the discussion of slices above, we wrote an <code>Append</code>
function.  We can define it as a method on slices instead.  To do
this, we first declare a named type to which we can bind the method, and
then make the receiver for the method a value of that type.
</p>
<pre>type ByteSlice []byte

func (slice ByteSlice) Append(data []byte) []byte {
    // Body exactly the same as the Append function defined above.
}
</pre>
<p>
This still requires the method to return the updated slice.  We can
eliminate that clumsiness by redefining the method to take a
<i>pointer</i> to a <code>ByteSlice</code> as its receiver, so the
method can overwrite the caller&#39;s slice.
</p>
<pre>func (p *ByteSlice) Append(data []byte) {
    slice := *p
    // Body as above, without the return.
    *p = slice
}
</pre>
<p>
In fact, we can do even better.  If we modify our function so it looks
like a standard <code>Write</code> method, like this,
</p>
<pre>func (p *ByteSlice) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error) {
    slice := *p
    // Again as above.
    *p = slice
    return len(data), nil
}
</pre>
<p>
then the type <code>*ByteSlice</code> satisfies the standard interface
<code>io.Writer</code>, which is handy.  For instance, we can
print into one.
</p>
<pre>    var b ByteSlice
    fmt.Fprintf(&amp;b, &#34;This hour has %d days\n&#34;, 7)
</pre>
<p>
We pass the address of a <code>ByteSlice</code>
because only <code>*ByteSlice</code> satisfies <code>io.Writer</code>.
The rule about pointers vs. values for receivers is that value methods
can be invoked on pointers and values, but pointer methods can only be
invoked on pointers.
</p>

<p>
This rule arises because pointer methods can modify the receiver; invoking
them on a value would cause the method to receive a copy of the value, so
any modifications would be discarded.
The language therefore disallows this mistake.
There is a handy exception, though. When the value is addressable, the
language takes care of the common case of invoking a pointer method on a
value by inserting the address operator automatically.
In our example, the variable <code>b</code> is addressable, so we can call
its <code>Write</code> method with just <code>b.Write</code>. The compiler
will rewrite that to <code>(&amp;b).Write</code> for us.
</p>

<p>
By the way, the idea of using <code>Write</code> on a slice of bytes
is central to the implementation of <code>bytes.Buffer</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="interfaces_and_types">Interfaces and other types</h2>

<h3 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h3>
<p>
Interfaces in Go provide a way to specify the behavior of an
object: if something can do <em>this</em>, then it can be used
<em>here</em>.  We&#39;ve seen a couple of simple examples already;
custom printers can be implemented by a <code>String</code> method
while <code>Fprintf</code> can generate output to anything
with a <code>Write</code> method.
Interfaces with only one or two methods are common in Go code, and are
usually given a name derived from the method, such as <code>io.Writer</code>
for something that implements <code>Write</code>.
</p>
<p>
A type can implement multiple interfaces.
For instance, a collection can be sorted
by the routines in package <code>sort</code> if it implements
<code>sort.Interface</code>, which contains <code>Len()</code>,
<code>Less(i, j int) bool</code>, and <code>Swap(i, j int)</code>,
and it could also have a custom formatter.
In this contrived example <code>Sequence</code> satisfies both.
</p>
<div>

<pre>type Sequence []int


func (s Sequence) Len() int {
    return len(s)
}
func (s Sequence) Less(i, j int) bool {
    return s[i] &lt; s[j]
}
func (s Sequence) Swap(i, j int) {
    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
}


func (s Sequence) Copy() Sequence {
    copy := make(Sequence, 0, len(s))
    return append(copy, s...)
}


func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy() 
    sort.Sort(s)
    str := &#34;[&#34;
    for i, elem := range s { 
        if i &gt; 0 {
            str += &#34; &#34;
        }
        str += fmt.Sprint(elem)
    }
    return str + &#34;]&#34;
}
</pre>
</div>



<h3 id="conversions">Conversions</h3>

<p>
The <code>String</code> method of <code>Sequence</code> is recreating the
work that <code>Sprint</code> already does for slices.
(It also has complexity O(N²), which is poor.) We can share the
effort (and also speed it up) if we convert the <code>Sequence</code> to a plain
<code>[]int</code> before calling <code>Sprint</code>.
</p>
<pre>func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy()
    sort.Sort(s)
    return fmt.Sprint([]int(s))
}
</pre>
<p>
This method is another example of the conversion technique for calling
<code>Sprintf</code> safely from a <code>String</code> method.
Because the two types (<code>Sequence</code> and <code>[]int</code>)
are the same if we ignore the type name, it&#39;s legal to convert between them.
The conversion doesn&#39;t create a new value, it just temporarily acts
as though the existing value has a new type.
(There are other legal conversions, such as from integer to floating point, that
do create a new value.)
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s an idiom in Go programs to convert the
type of an expression to access a different
set of methods. As an example, we could use the existing
type <code>sort.IntSlice</code> to reduce the entire example
to this:
</p>
<pre>type Sequence []int

// Method for printing - sorts the elements before printing
func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy()
    sort.IntSlice(s).Sort()
    return fmt.Sprint([]int(s))
}
</pre>
<p>
Now, instead of having <code>Sequence</code> implement multiple
interfaces (sorting and printing), we&#39;re using the ability of a data item to be
converted to multiple types (<code>Sequence</code>, <code>sort.IntSlice</code>
and <code>[]int</code>), each of which does some part of the job.
That&#39;s more unusual in practice but can be effective.
</p>

<h3 id="interface_conversions">Interface conversions and type assertions</h3>

<p>
<a href="#type_switch">Type switches</a> are a form of conversion: they take an interface and, for
each case in the switch, in a sense convert it to the type of that case.
Here&#39;s a simplified version of how the code under <code>fmt.Printf</code> turns a value into
a string using a type switch.
If it&#39;s already a string, we want the actual string value held by the interface, while if it has a
<code>String</code> method we want the result of calling the method.
</p>

<pre>type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

var value interface{} // Value provided by caller.
switch str := value.(type) {
case string:
    return str
case Stringer:
    return str.String()
}
</pre>

<p>
The first case finds a concrete value; the second converts the interface into another interface.
It&#39;s perfectly fine to mix types this way.
</p>

<p>
What if there&#39;s only one type we care about? If we know the value holds a <code>string</code>
and we just want to extract it?
A one-case type switch would do, but so would a <em>type assertion</em>.
A type assertion takes an interface value and extracts from it a value of the specified explicit type.
The syntax borrows from the clause opening a type switch, but with an explicit
type rather than the <code>type</code> keyword:
</p>

<pre>value.(typeName)
</pre>

<p>
and the result is a new value with the static type <code>typeName</code>.
That type must either be the concrete type held by the interface, or a second interface
type that the value can be converted to.
To extract the string we know is in the value, we could write:
</p>

<pre>str := value.(string)
</pre>

<p>
But if it turns out that the value does not contain a string, the program will crash with a run-time error.
To guard against that, use the &#34;comma, ok&#34; idiom to test, safely, whether the value is a string:
</p>

<pre>str, ok := value.(string)
if ok {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;string value is: %q\n&#34;, str)
} else {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;value is not a string\n&#34;)
}
</pre>

<p>
If the type assertion fails, <code>str</code> will still exist and be of type string, but it will have
the zero value, an empty string.
</p>

<p>
As an illustration of the capability, here&#39;s an <code>if</code>-<code>else</code>
statement that&#39;s equivalent to the type switch that opened this section.
</p>

<pre>if str, ok := value.(string); ok {
    return str
} else if str, ok := value.(Stringer); ok {
    return str.String()
}
</pre>

<h3 id="generality">Generality</h3>
<p>
If a type exists only to implement an interface and will
never have exported methods beyond that interface, there is
no need to export the type itself.
Exporting just the interface makes it clear the value has no
interesting behavior beyond what is described in the
interface.
It also avoids the need to repeat the documentation
on every instance of a common method.
</p>
<p>
In such cases, the constructor should return an interface value
rather than the implementing type.
As an example, in the hash libraries
both <code>crc32.NewIEEE</code> and <code>adler32.New</code>
return the interface type <code>hash.Hash32</code>.
Substituting the CRC-32 algorithm for Adler-32 in a Go program
requires only changing the constructor call;
the rest of the code is unaffected by the change of algorithm.
</p>
<p>
A similar approach allows the streaming cipher algorithms
in the various <code>crypto</code> packages to be
separated from the block ciphers they chain together.
The <code>Block</code> interface
in the <code>crypto/cipher</code> package specifies the
behavior of a block cipher, which provides encryption
of a single block of data.
Then, by analogy with the <code>bufio</code> package,
cipher packages that implement this interface
can be used to construct streaming ciphers, represented
by the <code>Stream</code> interface, without
knowing the details of the block encryption.
</p>
<p>
The  <code>crypto/cipher</code> interfaces look like this:
</p>
<pre>type Block interface {
    BlockSize() int
    Encrypt(dst, src []byte)
    Decrypt(dst, src []byte)
}

type Stream interface {
    XORKeyStream(dst, src []byte)
}
</pre>

<p>
Here&#39;s the definition of the counter mode (CTR) stream,
which turns a block cipher into a streaming cipher; notice
that the block cipher&#39;s details are abstracted away:
</p>

<pre>// NewCTR returns a Stream that encrypts/decrypts using the given Block in
// counter mode. The length of iv must be the same as the Block&#39;s block size.
func NewCTR(block Block, iv []byte) Stream
</pre>
<p>
<code>NewCTR</code> applies not
just to one specific encryption algorithm and data source but to any
implementation of the <code>Block</code> interface and any
<code>Stream</code>.  Because they return
interface values, replacing CTR
encryption with other encryption modes is a localized change.  The constructor
calls must be edited, but because the surrounding code must treat the result only
as a <code>Stream</code>, it won&#39;t notice the difference.
</p>

<h3 id="interface_methods">Interfaces and methods</h3>
<p>
Since almost anything can have methods attached, almost anything can
satisfy an interface.  One illustrative example is in the <code>http</code>
package, which defines the <code>Handler</code> interface.  Any object
that implements <code>Handler</code> can serve HTTP requests.
</p>
<pre>type Handler interface {
    ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
}
</pre>
<p>
<code>ResponseWriter</code> is itself an interface that provides access
to the methods needed to return the response to the client.
Those methods include the standard <code>Write</code> method, so an
<code>http.ResponseWriter</code> can be used wherever an <code>io.Writer</code>
can be used.
<code>Request</code> is a struct containing a parsed representation
of the request from the client.
</p>
<p>
For brevity, let&#39;s ignore POSTs and assume HTTP requests are always
GETs; that simplification does not affect the way the handlers are set up.
Here&#39;s a trivial implementation of a handler to count the number of times
the page is visited.
</p>
<pre>// Simple counter server.
type Counter struct {
    n int
}

func (ctr *Counter) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    ctr.n++
    fmt.Fprintf(w, &#34;counter = %d\n&#34;, ctr.n)
}
</pre>
<p>
(Keeping with our theme, note how <code>Fprintf</code> can print to an
<code>http.ResponseWriter</code>.)
In a real server, access to <code>ctr.n</code> would need protection from
concurrent access.
See the <code>sync</code> and <code>atomic</code> packages for suggestions.
</p>
<p>
For reference, here&#39;s how to attach such a server to a node on the URL tree.
</p>
<pre>import &#34;net/http&#34;
...
ctr := new(Counter)
http.Handle(&#34;/counter&#34;, ctr)
</pre>
<p>
But why make <code>Counter</code> a struct?  An integer is all that&#39;s needed.
(The receiver needs to be a pointer so the increment is visible to the caller.)
</p>
<pre>// Simpler counter server.
type Counter int

func (ctr *Counter) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    *ctr++
    fmt.Fprintf(w, &#34;counter = %d\n&#34;, *ctr)
}
</pre>
<p>
What if your program has some internal state that needs to be notified that a page
has been visited?  Tie a channel to the web page.
</p>
<pre>// A channel that sends a notification on each visit.
// (Probably want the channel to be buffered.)
type Chan chan *http.Request

func (ch Chan) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    ch &lt;- req
    fmt.Fprint(w, &#34;notification sent&#34;)
}
</pre>
<p>
Finally, let&#39;s say we wanted to present on <code>/args</code> the arguments
used when invoking the server binary.
It&#39;s easy to write a function to print the arguments.
</p>
<pre>func ArgServer() {
    fmt.Println(os.Args)
}
</pre>
<p>
How do we turn that into an HTTP server?  We could make <code>ArgServer</code>
a method of some type whose value we ignore, but there&#39;s a cleaner way.
Since we can define a method for any type except pointers and interfaces,
we can write a method for a function.
The <code>http</code> package contains this code:
</p>
<pre>// The HandlerFunc type is an adapter to allow the use of
// ordinary functions as HTTP handlers.  If f is a function
// with the appropriate signature, HandlerFunc(f) is a
// Handler object that calls f.
type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)

// ServeHTTP calls f(w, req).
func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, req *Request) {
    f(w, req)
}
</pre>
<p>
<code>HandlerFunc</code> is a type with a method, <code>ServeHTTP</code>,
so values of that type can serve HTTP requests.  Look at the implementation
of the method: the receiver is a function, <code>f</code>, and the method
calls <code>f</code>.  That may seem odd but it&#39;s not that different from, say,
the receiver being a channel and the method sending on the channel.
</p>
<p>
To make <code>ArgServer</code> into an HTTP server, we first modify it
to have the right signature.
</p>
<pre>// Argument server.
func ArgServer(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, os.Args)
}
</pre>
<p>
<code>ArgServer</code> now has the same signature as <code>HandlerFunc</code>,
so it can be converted to that type to access its methods,
just as we converted <code>Sequence</code> to <code>IntSlice</code>
to access <code>IntSlice.Sort</code>.
The code to set it up is concise:
</p>
<pre>http.Handle(&#34;/args&#34;, http.HandlerFunc(ArgServer))
</pre>
<p>
When someone visits the page <code>/args</code>,
the handler installed at that page has value <code>ArgServer</code>
and type <code>HandlerFunc</code>.
The HTTP server will invoke the method <code>ServeHTTP</code>
of that type, with <code>ArgServer</code> as the receiver, which will in turn call
<code>ArgServer</code> (via the invocation <code>f(w, req)</code>
inside <code>HandlerFunc.ServeHTTP</code>).
The arguments will then be displayed.
</p>
<p>
In this section we have made an HTTP server from a struct, an integer,
a channel, and a function, all because interfaces are just sets of
methods, which can be defined for (almost) any type.
</p>

<h2 id="blank">The blank identifier</h2>

<p>
We&#39;ve mentioned the blank identifier a couple of times now, in the context of
<a href="#for"><code>for</code> <code>range</code> loops</a>
and <a href="#maps">maps</a>.
The blank identifier can be assigned or declared with any value of any type, with the
value discarded harmlessly.
It&#39;s a bit like writing to the Unix <code>/dev/null</code> file:
it represents a write-only value
to be used as a place-holder
where a variable is needed but the actual value is irrelevant.
It has uses beyond those we&#39;ve seen already.
</p>

<h3 id="blank_assign">The blank identifier in multiple assignment</h3>

<p>
The use of a blank identifier in a <code>for</code> <code>range</code> loop is a
special case of a general situation: multiple assignment.
</p>

<p>
If an assignment requires multiple values on the left side,
but one of the values will not be used by the program,
a blank identifier on the left-hand-side of
the assignment avoids the need
to create a dummy variable and makes it clear that the
value is to be discarded.
For instance, when calling a function that returns
a value and an error, but only the error is important,
use the blank identifier to discard the irrelevant value.
</p>

<pre>if _, err := os.Stat(path); os.IsNotExist(err) {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;%s does not exist\n&#34;, path)
}
</pre>

<p>
Occasionally you&#39;ll see code that discards the error value in order
to ignore the error; this is terrible practice. Always check error returns;
they&#39;re provided for a reason.
</p>

<pre>// Bad! This code will crash if path does not exist.
fi, _ := os.Stat(path)
if fi.IsDir() {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;%s is a directory\n&#34;, path)
}
</pre>

<h3 id="blank_unused">Unused imports and variables</h3>

<p>
It is an error to import a package or to declare a variable without using it.
Unused imports bloat the program and slow compilation,
while a variable that is initialized but not used is at least
a wasted computation and perhaps indicative of a
larger bug.
When a program is under active development, however,
unused imports and variables often arise and it can
be annoying to delete them just to have the compilation proceed,
only to have them be needed again later.
The blank identifier provides a workaround.
</p>
<p>
This half-written program has two unused imports
(<code>fmt</code> and <code>io</code>)
and an unused variable (<code>fd</code>),
so it will not compile, but it would be nice to see if the
code so far is correct.
</p>
<div>

<pre>package main

import (
    &#34;fmt&#34;
    &#34;io&#34;
    &#34;log&#34;
    &#34;os&#34;
)

func main() {
    fd, err := os.Open(&#34;test.go&#34;)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
}
</pre>
</div>


<p>
To silence complaints about the unused imports, use a
blank identifier to refer to a symbol from the imported package.
Similarly, assigning the unused variable <code>fd</code>
to the blank identifier will silence the unused variable error.
This version of the program does compile.
</p>
<div>

<pre>package main

import (
    &#34;fmt&#34;
    &#34;io&#34;
    &#34;log&#34;
    &#34;os&#34;
)

var _ = fmt.Printf 
var _ io.Reader    

func main() {
    fd, err := os.Open(&#34;test.go&#34;)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    _ = fd
}
</pre>
</div>



<p>
By convention, the global declarations to silence import errors
should come right after the imports and be commented,
both to make them easy to find and as a reminder to clean things up later.
</p>

<h3 id="blank_import">Import for side effect</h3>

<p>
An unused import like <code>fmt</code> or <code>io</code> in the
previous example should eventually be used or removed:
blank assignments identify code as a work in progress.
But sometimes it is useful to import a package only for its
side effects, without any explicit use.
For example, during its <code>init</code> function,
the <code><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/net/http/pprof/">net/http/pprof</a></code>
package registers HTTP handlers that provide
debugging information. It has an exported API, but
most clients need only the handler registration and
access the data through a web page.
To import the package only for its side effects, rename the package
to the blank identifier:
</p>
<pre>import _ &#34;net/http/pprof&#34;
</pre>
<p>
This form of import makes clear that the package is being
imported for its side effects, because there is no other possible
use of the package: in this file, it doesn&#39;t have a name.
(If it did, and we didn&#39;t use that name, the compiler would reject the program.)
</p>

<h3 id="blank_implements">Interface checks</h3>

<p>
As we saw in the discussion of <a href="#interfaces_and_types">interfaces</a> above,
a type need not declare explicitly that it implements an interface.
Instead, a type implements the interface just by implementing the interface&#39;s methods.
In practice, most interface conversions are static and therefore checked at compile time.
For example, passing an <code>*os.File</code> to a function
expecting an <code>io.Reader</code> will not compile unless
<code>*os.File</code> implements the <code>io.Reader</code> interface.
</p>

<p>
Some interface checks do happen at run-time, though.
One instance is in the <code><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/">encoding/json</a></code>
package, which defines a <code><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshaler">Marshaler</a></code>
interface. When the JSON encoder receives a value that implements that interface,
the encoder invokes the value&#39;s marshaling method to convert it to JSON
instead of doing the standard conversion.
The encoder checks this property at run time with a <a href="#interface_conversions">type assertion</a> like:
</p>

<pre>m, ok := val.(json.Marshaler)
</pre>

<p>
If it&#39;s necessary only to ask whether a type implements an interface, without
actually using the interface itself, perhaps as part of an error check, use the blank
identifier to ignore the type-asserted value:
</p>

<pre>if _, ok := val.(json.Marshaler); ok {
    fmt.Printf(&#34;value %v of type %T implements json.Marshaler\n&#34;, val, val)
}
</pre>

<p>
One place this situation arises is when it is necessary to guarantee within the package implementing the type that
it actually satisfies the interface.
If a type—for example,
<code><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/#RawMessage">json.RawMessage</a></code>—needs
a custom JSON representation, it should implement
<code>json.Marshaler</code>, but there are no static conversions that would
cause the compiler to verify this automatically.
If the type inadvertently fails to satisfy the interface, the JSON encoder will still work,
but will not use the custom implementation.
To guarantee that the implementation is correct,
a global declaration using the blank identifier can be used in the package:
</p>
<pre>var _ json.Marshaler = (*RawMessage)(nil)
</pre>
<p>
In this declaration, the assignment involving a conversion of a
<code>*RawMessage</code> to a <code>Marshaler</code>
requires that <code>*RawMessage</code> implements <code>Marshaler</code>,
and that property will be checked at compile time.
Should the <code>json.Marshaler</code> interface change, this package
will no longer compile and we will be on notice that it needs to be updated.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the blank identifier in this construct indicates that
the declaration exists only for the type checking,
not to create a variable.
Don&#39;t do this for every type that satisfies an interface, though.
By convention, such declarations are only used
when there are no static conversions already present in the code,
which is a rare event.
</p>


<h2 id="embedding">Embedding</h2>

<p>
Go does not provide the typical, type-driven notion of subclassing,
but it does have the ability to “borrow” pieces of an
implementation by <em>embedding</em> types within a struct or
interface.
</p>
<p>
Interface embedding is very simple.
We&#39;ve mentioned the <code>io.Reader</code> and <code>io.Writer</code> interfaces before;
here are their definitions.
</p>
<pre>type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Writer interface {
    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>io</code> package also exports several other interfaces
that specify objects that can implement several such methods.
For instance, there is <code>io.ReadWriter</code>, an interface
containing both <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code>.
We could specify <code>io.ReadWriter</code> by listing the
two methods explicitly, but it&#39;s easier and more evocative
to embed the two interfaces to form the new one, like this:
</p>
<pre>// ReadWriter is the interface that combines the Reader and Writer interfaces.
type ReadWriter interface {
    Reader
    Writer
}
</pre>
<p>
This says just what it looks like: A <code>ReadWriter</code> can do
what a <code>Reader</code> does <em>and</em> what a <code>Writer</code>
does; it is a union of the embedded interfaces.
Only interfaces can be embedded within interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The same basic idea applies to structs, but with more far-reaching
implications.  The <code>bufio</code> package has two struct types,
<code>bufio.Reader</code> and <code>bufio.Writer</code>, each of
which of course implements the analogous interfaces from package
<code>io</code>.
And <code>bufio</code> also implements a buffered reader/writer,
which it does by combining a reader and a writer into one struct
using embedding: it lists the types within the struct
but does not give them field names.
</p>
<pre>// ReadWriter stores pointers to a Reader and a Writer.
// It implements io.ReadWriter.
type ReadWriter struct {
    *Reader  // *bufio.Reader
    *Writer  // *bufio.Writer
}
</pre>
<p>
The embedded elements are pointers to structs and of course
must be initialized to point to valid structs before they
can be used.
The <code>ReadWriter</code> struct could be written as
</p>
<pre>type ReadWriter struct {
    reader *Reader
    writer *Writer
}
</pre>
<p>
but then to promote the methods of the fields and to
satisfy the <code>io</code> interfaces, we would also need
to provide forwarding methods, like this:
</p>
<pre>func (rw *ReadWriter) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    return rw.reader.Read(p)
}
</pre>
<p>
By embedding the structs directly, we avoid this bookkeeping.
The methods of embedded types come along for free, which means that <code>bufio.ReadWriter</code>
not only has the methods of <code>bufio.Reader</code> and <code>bufio.Writer</code>,
it also satisfies all three interfaces:
<code>io.Reader</code>,
<code>io.Writer</code>, and
<code>io.ReadWriter</code>.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s an important way in which embedding differs from subclassing.  When we embed a type,
the methods of that type become methods of the outer type,
but when they are invoked the receiver of the method is the inner type, not the outer one.
In our example, when the <code>Read</code> method of a <code>bufio.ReadWriter</code> is
invoked, it has exactly the same effect as the forwarding method written out above;
the receiver is the <code>reader</code> field of the <code>ReadWriter</code>, not the
<code>ReadWriter</code> itself.
</p>
<p>
Embedding can also be a simple convenience.
This example shows an embedded field alongside a regular, named field.
</p>
<pre>type Job struct {
    Command string
    *log.Logger
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Job</code> type now has the <code>Print</code>, <code>Printf</code>, <code>Println</code>
and other
methods of <code>*log.Logger</code>.  We could have given the <code>Logger</code>
a field name, of course, but it&#39;s not necessary to do so.  And now, once
initialized, we can
log to the <code>Job</code>:
</p>
<pre>job.Println(&#34;starting now...&#34;)
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Logger</code> is a regular field of the <code>Job</code> struct,
so we can initialize it in the usual way inside the constructor for <code>Job</code>, like this,
</p>
<pre>func NewJob(command string, logger *log.Logger) *Job {
    return &amp;Job{command, logger}
}
</pre>
<p>
or with a composite literal,
</p>
<pre>job := &amp;Job{command, log.New(os.Stderr, &#34;Job: &#34;, log.Ldate)}
</pre>
<p>
If we need to refer to an embedded field directly, the type name of the field,
ignoring the package qualifier, serves as a field name, as it did
in the <code>Read</code> method of our <code>ReadWriter</code> struct.
Here, if we needed to access the
<code>*log.Logger</code> of a <code>Job</code> variable <code>job</code>,
we would write <code>job.Logger</code>,
which would be useful if we wanted to refine the methods of <code>Logger</code>.
</p>
<pre>func (job *Job) Printf(format string, args ...interface{}) {
    job.Logger.Printf(&#34;%q: %s&#34;, job.Command, fmt.Sprintf(format, args...))
}
</pre>
<p>
Embedding types introduces the problem of name conflicts but the rules to resolve
them are simple.
First, a field or method <code>X</code> hides any other item <code>X</code> in a more deeply
nested part of the type.
If <code>log.Logger</code> contained a field or method called <code>Command</code>, the <code>Command</code> field
of <code>Job</code> would dominate it.
</p>
<p>
Second, if the same name appears at the same nesting level, it is usually an error;
it would be erroneous to embed <code>log.Logger</code> if the <code>Job</code> struct
contained another field or method called <code>Logger</code>.
However, if the duplicate name is never mentioned in the program outside the type definition, it is OK.
This qualification provides some protection against changes made to types embedded from outside; there
is no problem if a field is added that conflicts with another field in another subtype if neither field
is ever used.
</p>


<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>

<h3 id="sharing">Share by communicating</h3>

<p>
Concurrent programming is a large topic and there is space only for some
Go-specific highlights here.
</p>
<p>
Concurrent programming in many environments is made difficult by the
subtleties required to implement correct access to shared variables.  Go encourages
a different approach in which shared values are passed around on channels
and, in fact, never actively shared by separate threads of execution.
Only one goroutine has access to the value at any given time.
Data races cannot occur, by design.
To encourage this way of thinking we have reduced it to a slogan:
</p>
<blockquote>
Do not communicate by sharing memory;
instead, share memory by communicating.
</blockquote>
<p>
This approach can be taken too far.  Reference counts may be best done
by putting a mutex around an integer variable, for instance.  But as a
high-level approach, using channels to control access makes it easier
to write clear, correct programs.
</p>
<p>
One way to think about this model is to consider a typical single-threaded
program running on one CPU. It has no need for synchronization primitives.
Now run another such instance; it too needs no synchronization.  Now let those
two communicate; if the communication is the synchronizer, there&#39;s still no need
for other synchronization.  Unix pipelines, for example, fit this model
perfectly.  Although Go&#39;s approach to concurrency originates in Hoare&#39;s
Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP),
it can also be seen as a type-safe generalization of Unix pipes.
</p>

<h3 id="goroutines">Goroutines</h3>

<p>
They&#39;re called <em>goroutines</em> because the existing
terms—threads, coroutines, processes, and so on—convey
inaccurate connotations.  A goroutine has a simple model: it is a
function executing concurrently with other goroutines in the same
address space.  It is lightweight, costing little more than the
allocation of stack space.
And the stacks start small, so they are cheap, and grow
by allocating (and freeing) heap storage as required.
</p>
<p>
Goroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should
block, such as while waiting for I/O, others continue to run.  Their
design hides many of the complexities of thread creation and
management.
</p>
<p>
Prefix a function or method call with the <code>go</code>
keyword to run the call in a new goroutine.
When the call completes, the goroutine
exits, silently.  (The effect is similar to the Unix shell&#39;s
<code>&amp;</code> notation for running a command in the
background.)
</p>
<pre>go list.Sort()  // run list.Sort concurrently; don&#39;t wait for it.
</pre>
<p>
A function literal can be handy in a goroutine invocation.
</p>
<pre>func Announce(message string, delay time.Duration) {
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(delay)
        fmt.Println(message)
    }()  // Note the parentheses - must call the function.
}
</pre>
<p>
In Go, function literals are closures: the implementation makes
sure the variables referred to by the function survive as long as they are active.
</p>
<p>
These examples aren&#39;t too practical because the functions have no way of signaling
completion.  For that, we need channels.
</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>
Like maps, channels are allocated with <code>make</code>, and
the resulting value acts as a reference to an underlying data structure.
If an optional integer parameter is provided, it sets the buffer size for the channel.
The default is zero, for an unbuffered or synchronous channel.
</p>
<pre>ci := make(chan int)            // unbuffered channel of integers
cj := make(chan int, 0)         // unbuffered channel of integers
cs := make(chan *os.File, 100)  // buffered channel of pointers to Files
</pre>
<p>
Unbuffered channels combine communication—the exchange of a value—with
synchronization—guaranteeing that two calculations (goroutines) are in
a known state.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of nice idioms using channels.  Here&#39;s one to get us started.
In the previous section we launched a sort in the background. A channel
can allow the launching goroutine to wait for the sort to complete.
</p>
<pre>c := make(chan int)  // Allocate a channel.
// Start the sort in a goroutine; when it completes, signal on the channel.
go func() {
    list.Sort()
    c &lt;- 1  // Send a signal; value does not matter.
}()
doSomethingForAWhile()
&lt;-c   // Wait for sort to finish; discard sent value.
</pre>
<p>
Receivers always block until there is data to receive.
If the channel is unbuffered, the sender blocks until the receiver has
received the value.
If the channel has a buffer, the sender blocks only until the
value has been copied to the buffer; if the buffer is full, this
means waiting until some receiver has retrieved a value.
</p>
<p>
A buffered channel can be used like a semaphore, for instance to
limit throughput.  In this example, incoming requests are passed
to <code>handle</code>, which sends a value into the channel, processes
the request, and then receives a value from the channel
to ready the “semaphore” for the next consumer.
The capacity of the channel buffer limits the number of
simultaneous calls to <code>process</code>.
</p>
<pre>var sem = make(chan int, MaxOutstanding)

func handle(r *Request) {
    sem &lt;- 1    // Wait for active queue to drain.
    process(r)  // May take a long time.
    &lt;-sem       // Done; enable next request to run.
}

func Serve(queue chan *Request) {
    for {
        req := &lt;-queue
        go handle(req)  // Don&#39;t wait for handle to finish.
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Once <code>MaxOutstanding</code> handlers are executing <code>process</code>,
any more will block trying to send into the filled channel buffer,
until one of the existing handlers finishes and receives from the buffer.
</p>

<p>
This design has a problem, though: <code>Serve</code>
creates a new goroutine for
every incoming request, even though only <code>MaxOutstanding</code>
of them can run at any moment.
As a result, the program can consume unlimited resources if the requests come in too fast.
We can address that deficiency by changing <code>Serve</code> to
gate the creation of the goroutines.
Here&#39;s an obvious solution, but beware it has a bug we&#39;ll fix subsequently:
</p>

<pre>func Serve(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        sem &lt;- 1
        go func() {
            process(req) // Buggy; see explanation below.
            &lt;-sem
        }()
    }
}</pre>

<p>
The bug is that in a Go <code>for</code> loop, the loop variable
is reused for each iteration, so the <code>req</code>
variable is shared across all goroutines.
That&#39;s not what we want.
We need to make sure that <code>req</code> is unique for each goroutine.
Here&#39;s one way to do that, passing the value of <code>req</code> as an argument
to the closure in the goroutine:
</p>

<pre>func Serve(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        sem &lt;- 1
        go func(req *Request) {
            process(req)
            &lt;-sem
        }(req)
    }
}</pre>

<p>
Compare this version with the previous to see the difference in how
the closure is declared and run.
Another solution is just to create a new variable with the same
name, as in this example:
</p>

<pre>func Serve(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        req := req // Create new instance of req for the goroutine.
        sem &lt;- 1
        go func() {
            process(req)
            &lt;-sem
        }()
    }
}</pre>

<p>
It may seem odd to write
</p>

<pre>req := req
</pre>

<p>
but it&#39;s legal and idiomatic in Go to do this.
You get a fresh version of the variable with the same name, deliberately
shadowing the loop variable locally but unique to each goroutine.
</p>

<p>
Going back to the general problem of writing the server,
another approach that manages resources well is to start a fixed
number of <code>handle</code> goroutines all reading from the request
channel.
The number of goroutines limits the number of simultaneous
calls to <code>process</code>.
This <code>Serve</code> function also accepts a channel on which
it will be told to exit; after launching the goroutines it blocks
receiving from that channel.
</p>

<pre>func handle(queue chan *Request) {
    for r := range queue {
        process(r)
    }
}

func Serve(clientRequests chan *Request, quit chan bool) {
    // Start handlers
    for i := 0; i &lt; MaxOutstanding; i++ {
        go handle(clientRequests)
    }
    &lt;-quit  // Wait to be told to exit.
}
</pre>

<h3 id="chan_of_chan">Channels of channels</h3>
<p>
One of the most important properties of Go is that
a channel is a first-class value that can be allocated and passed
around like any other.  A common use of this property is
to implement safe, parallel demultiplexing.
</p>
<p>
In the example in the previous section, <code>handle</code> was
an idealized handler for a request but we didn&#39;t define the
type it was handling.  If that type includes a channel on which
to reply, each client can provide its own path for the answer.
Here&#39;s a schematic definition of type <code>Request</code>.
</p>
<pre>type Request struct {
    args        []int
    f           func([]int) int
    resultChan  chan int
}
</pre>
<p>
The client provides a function and its arguments, as well as
a channel inside the request object on which to receive the answer.
</p>
<pre>func sum(a []int) (s int) {
    for _, v := range a {
        s += v
    }
    return
}

request := &amp;Request{[]int{3, 4, 5}, sum, make(chan int)}
// Send request
clientRequests &lt;- request
// Wait for response.
fmt.Printf(&#34;answer: %d\n&#34;, &lt;-request.resultChan)
</pre>
<p>
On the server side, the handler function is the only thing that changes.
</p>
<pre>func handle(queue chan *Request) {
    for req := range queue {
        req.resultChan &lt;- req.f(req.args)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
There&#39;s clearly a lot more to do to make it realistic, but this
code is a framework for a rate-limited, parallel, non-blocking RPC
system, and there&#39;s not a mutex in sight.
</p>

<h3 id="parallel">Parallelization</h3>
<p>
Another application of these ideas is to parallelize a calculation
across multiple CPU cores.  If the calculation can be broken into
separate pieces that can execute independently, it can be parallelized,
with a channel to signal when each piece completes.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s say we have an expensive operation to perform on a vector of items,
and that the value of the operation on each item is independent,
as in this idealized example.
</p>
<pre>type Vector []float64

// Apply the operation to v[i], v[i+1] ... up to v[n-1].
func (v Vector) DoSome(i, n int, u Vector, c chan int) {
    for ; i &lt; n; i++ {
        v[i] += u.Op(v[i])
    }
    c &lt;- 1    // signal that this piece is done
}
</pre>
<p>
We launch the pieces independently in a loop, one per CPU.
They can complete in any order but it doesn&#39;t matter; we just
count the completion signals by draining the channel after
launching all the goroutines.
</p>
<pre>const numCPU = 4 // number of CPU cores

func (v Vector) DoAll(u Vector) {
    c := make(chan int, numCPU)  // Buffering optional but sensible.
    for i := 0; i &lt; numCPU; i++ {
        go v.DoSome(i*len(v)/numCPU, (i+1)*len(v)/numCPU, u, c)
    }
    // Drain the channel.
    for i := 0; i &lt; numCPU; i++ {
        &lt;-c    // wait for one task to complete
    }
    // All done.
}
</pre>
<p>
Rather than create a constant value for numCPU, we can ask the runtime what
value is appropriate.
The function <code><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#NumCPU">runtime.NumCPU</a></code>
returns the number of hardware CPU cores in the machine, so we could write
</p>
<pre>var numCPU = runtime.NumCPU()
</pre>
<p>
There is also a function
<code><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#GOMAXPROCS">runtime.GOMAXPROCS</a></code>,
which reports (or sets)
the user-specified number of cores that a Go program can have running
simultaneously.
It defaults to the value of <code>runtime.NumCPU</code> but can be
overridden by setting the similarly named shell environment variable
or by calling the function with a positive number.  Calling it with
zero just queries the value.
Therefore if we want to honor the user&#39;s resource request, we should write
</p>
<pre>var numCPU = runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0)
</pre>
<p>
Be sure not to confuse the ideas of concurrency—structuring a program
as independently executing components—and parallelism—executing
calculations in parallel for efficiency on multiple CPUs.
Although the concurrency features of Go can make some problems easy
to structure as parallel computations, Go is a concurrent language,
not a parallel one, and not all parallelization problems fit Go&#39;s model.
For a discussion of the distinction, see the talk cited in
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/2013/01/concurrency-is-not-parallelism.html">this
blog post</a>.

</p><h3 id="leaky_buffer">A leaky buffer</h3>

<p>
The tools of concurrent programming can even make non-concurrent
ideas easier to express.  Here&#39;s an example abstracted from an RPC
package.  The client goroutine loops receiving data from some source,
perhaps a network.  To avoid allocating and freeing buffers, it keeps
a free list, and uses a buffered channel to represent it.  If the
channel is empty, a new buffer gets allocated.
Once the message buffer is ready, it&#39;s sent to the server on
<code>serverChan</code>.
</p>
<pre>var freeList = make(chan *Buffer, 100)
var serverChan = make(chan *Buffer)

func client() {
    for {
        var b *Buffer
        // Grab a buffer if available; allocate if not.
        select {
        case b = &lt;-freeList:
            // Got one; nothing more to do.
        default:
            // None free, so allocate a new one.
            b = new(Buffer)
        }
        load(b)              // Read next message from the net.
        serverChan &lt;- b      // Send to server.
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The server loop receives each message from the client, processes it,
and returns the buffer to the free list.
</p>
<pre>func server() {
    for {
        b := &lt;-serverChan    // Wait for work.
        process(b)
        // Reuse buffer if there&#39;s room.
        select {
        case freeList &lt;- b:
            // Buffer on free list; nothing more to do.
        default:
            // Free list full, just carry on.
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The client attempts to retrieve a buffer from <code>freeList</code>;
if none is available, it allocates a fresh one.
The server&#39;s send to <code>freeList</code> puts <code>b</code> back
on the free list unless the list is full, in which case the
buffer is dropped on the floor to be reclaimed by
the garbage collector.
(The <code>default</code> clauses in the <code>select</code>
statements execute when no other case is ready,
meaning that the <code>selects</code> never block.)
This implementation builds a leaky bucket free list
in just a few lines, relying on the buffered channel and
the garbage collector for bookkeeping.
</p>

<h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>

<p>
Library routines must often return some sort of error indication to
the caller.
As mentioned earlier, Go&#39;s multivalue return makes it
easy to return a detailed error description alongside the normal
return value.
It is good style to use this feature to provide detailed error information.
For example, as we&#39;ll see, <code>os.Open</code> doesn&#39;t
just return a <code>nil</code> pointer on failure, it also returns an
error value that describes what went wrong.
</p>

<p>
By convention, errors have type <code>error</code>,
a simple built-in interface.
</p>
<pre>type error interface {
    Error() string
}
</pre>
<p>
A library writer is free to implement this interface with a
richer model under the covers, making it possible not only
to see the error but also to provide some context.
As mentioned, alongside the usual <code>*os.File</code>
return value, <code>os.Open</code> also returns an
error value.
If the file is opened successfully, the error will be <code>nil</code>,
but when there is a problem, it will hold an
<code>os.PathError</code>:
</p>
<pre>// PathError records an error and the operation and
// file path that caused it.
type PathError struct {
    Op string    // &#34;open&#34;, &#34;unlink&#34;, etc.
    Path string  // The associated file.
    Err error    // Returned by the system call.
}

func (e *PathError) Error() string {
    return e.Op + &#34; &#34; + e.Path + &#34;: &#34; + e.Err.Error()
}
</pre>
<p>
<code>PathError</code>&#39;s <code>Error</code> generates
a string like this:
</p>
<pre>open /etc/passwx: no such file or directory
</pre>
<p>
Such an error, which includes the problematic file name, the
operation, and the operating system error it triggered, is useful even
if printed far from the call that caused it;
it is much more informative than the plain
&#34;no such file or directory&#34;.
</p>

<p>
When feasible, error strings should identify their origin, such as by having
a prefix naming the operation or package that generated the error.  For example, in package
<code>image</code>, the string representation for a decoding error due to an
unknown format is &#34;image: unknown format&#34;.
</p>

<p>
Callers that care about the precise error details can
use a type switch or a type assertion to look for specific
errors and extract details.  For <code>PathErrors</code>
this might include examining the internal <code>Err</code>
field for recoverable failures.
</p>

<pre>for try := 0; try &lt; 2; try++ {
    file, err = os.Create(filename)
    if err == nil {
        return
    }
    if e, ok := err.(*os.PathError); ok &amp;&amp; e.Err == syscall.ENOSPC {
        deleteTempFiles()  // Recover some space.
        continue
    }
    return
}
</pre>

<p>
The second <code>if</code> statement here is another <a href="#interface_conversions">type assertion</a>.
If it fails, <code>ok</code> will be false, and <code>e</code>
will be <code>nil</code>.
If it succeeds,  <code>ok</code> will be true, which means the
error was of type <code>*os.PathError</code>, and then so is <code>e</code>,
which we can examine for more information about the error.
</p>

<h3 id="panic">Panic</h3>

<p>
The usual way to report an error to a caller is to return an
<code>error</code> as an extra return value.  The canonical
<code>Read</code> method is a well-known instance; it returns a byte
count and an <code>error</code>.  But what if the error is
unrecoverable?  Sometimes the program simply cannot continue.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose, there is a built-in function <code>panic</code>
that in effect creates a run-time error that will stop the program
(but see the next section).  The function takes a single argument
of arbitrary type—often a string—to be printed as the
program dies.  It&#39;s also a way to indicate that something impossible has
happened, such as exiting an infinite loop.
</p>


<pre>// A toy implementation of cube root using Newton&#39;s method.
func CubeRoot(x float64) float64 {
    z := x/3   // Arbitrary initial value
    for i := 0; i &lt; 1e6; i++ {
        prevz := z
        z -= (z*z*z-x) / (3*z*z)
        if veryClose(z, prevz) {
            return z
        }
    }
    // A million iterations has not converged; something is wrong.
    panic(fmt.Sprintf(&#34;CubeRoot(%g) did not converge&#34;, x))
}
</pre>

<p>
This is only an example but real library functions should
avoid <code>panic</code>.  If the problem can be masked or worked
around, it&#39;s always better to let things continue to run rather
than taking down the whole program.  One possible counterexample
is during initialization: if the library truly cannot set itself up,
it might be reasonable to panic, so to speak.
</p>

<pre>var user = os.Getenv(&#34;USER&#34;)

func init() {
    if user == &#34;&#34; {
        panic(&#34;no value for $USER&#34;)
    }
}
</pre>

<h3 id="recover">Recover</h3>

<p>
When <code>panic</code> is called, including implicitly for run-time
errors such as indexing a slice out of bounds or failing a type
assertion, it immediately stops execution of the current function
and begins unwinding the stack of the goroutine, running any deferred
functions along the way.  If that unwinding reaches the top of the
goroutine&#39;s stack, the program dies.  However, it is possible to
use the built-in function <code>recover</code> to regain control
of the goroutine and resume normal execution.
</p>

<p>
A call to <code>recover</code> stops the unwinding and returns the
argument passed to <code>panic</code>.  Because the only code that
runs while unwinding is inside deferred functions, <code>recover</code>
is only useful inside deferred functions.
</p>

<p>
One application of <code>recover</code> is to shut down a failing goroutine
inside a server without killing the other executing goroutines.
</p>

<pre>func server(workChan &lt;-chan *Work) {
    for work := range workChan {
        go safelyDo(work)
    }
}

func safelyDo(work *Work) {
    defer func() {
        if err := recover(); err != nil {
            log.Println(&#34;work failed:&#34;, err)
        }
    }()
    do(work)
}
</pre>

<p>
In this example, if <code>do(work)</code> panics, the result will be
logged and the goroutine will exit cleanly without disturbing the
others.  There&#39;s no need to do anything else in the deferred closure;
calling <code>recover</code> handles the condition completely.
</p>

<p>
Because <code>recover</code> always returns <code>nil</code> unless called directly
from a deferred function, deferred code can call library routines that themselves
use <code>panic</code> and <code>recover</code> without failing.  As an example,
the deferred function in <code>safelyDo</code> might call a logging function before
calling <code>recover</code>, and that logging code would run unaffected
by the panicking state.
</p>

<p>
With our recovery pattern in place, the <code>do</code>
function (and anything it calls) can get out of any bad situation
cleanly by calling <code>panic</code>.  We can use that idea to
simplify error handling in complex software.  Let&#39;s look at an
idealized version of a <code>regexp</code> package, which reports
parsing errors by calling <code>panic</code> with a local
error type.  Here&#39;s the definition of <code>Error</code>,
an <code>error</code> method, and the <code>Compile</code> function.
</p>

<pre>// Error is the type of a parse error; it satisfies the error interface.
type Error string
func (e Error) Error() string {
    return string(e)
}

// error is a method of *Regexp that reports parsing errors by
// panicking with an Error.
func (regexp *Regexp) error(err string) {
    panic(Error(err))
}

// Compile returns a parsed representation of the regular expression.
func Compile(str string) (regexp *Regexp, err error) {
    regexp = new(Regexp)
    // doParse will panic if there is a parse error.
    defer func() {
        if e := recover(); e != nil {
            regexp = nil    // Clear return value.
            err = e.(Error) // Will re-panic if not a parse error.
        }
    }()
    return regexp.doParse(str), nil
}
</pre>

<p>
If <code>doParse</code> panics, the recovery block will set the
return value to <code>nil</code>—deferred functions can modify
named return values.  It will then check, in the assignment
to <code>err</code>, that the problem was a parse error by asserting
that it has the local type <code>Error</code>.
If it does not, the type assertion will fail, causing a run-time error
that continues the stack unwinding as though nothing had interrupted
it.
This check means that if something unexpected happens, such
as an index out of bounds, the code will fail even though we
are using <code>panic</code> and <code>recover</code> to handle
parse errors.
</p>

<p>
With error handling in place, the <code>error</code> method (because it&#39;s a
method bound to a type, it&#39;s fine, even natural, for it to have the same name
as the builtin <code>error</code> type)
makes it easy to report parse errors without worrying about unwinding
the parse stack by hand:
</p>

<pre>if pos == 0 {
    re.error(&#34;&#39;*&#39; illegal at start of expression&#34;)
}
</pre>

<p>
Useful though this pattern is, it should be used only within a package.
<code>Parse</code> turns its internal <code>panic</code> calls into
<code>error</code> values; it does not expose <code>panics</code>
to its client.  That is a good rule to follow.
</p>

<p>
By the way, this re-panic idiom changes the panic value if an actual
error occurs.  However, both the original and new failures will be
presented in the crash report, so the root cause of the problem will
still be visible.  Thus this simple re-panic approach is usually
sufficient—it&#39;s a crash after all—but if you want to
display only the original value, you can write a little more code to
filter unexpected problems and re-panic with the original error.
That&#39;s left as an exercise for the reader.

<h2 id="web_server">A web server</h2>

<p>
Let&#39;s finish with a complete Go program, a web server.
This one is actually a kind of web re-server.
Google provides a service at <code>chart.apis.google.com</code>
that does automatic formatting of data into charts and graphs.
It&#39;s hard to use interactively, though,
because you need to put the data into the URL as a query.
The program here provides a nicer interface to one form of data: given a short piece of text,
it calls on the chart server to produce a QR code, a matrix of boxes that encode the
text.
That image can be grabbed with your cell phone&#39;s camera and interpreted as,
for instance, a URL, saving you typing the URL into the phone&#39;s tiny keyboard.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the complete program.
An explanation follows.
</p>
<div>

<pre>package main

import (
    &#34;flag&#34;
    &#34;html/template&#34;
    &#34;log&#34;
    &#34;net/http&#34;
)

var addr = flag.String(&#34;addr&#34;, &#34;:1718&#34;, &#34;http service address&#34;) 

var templ = template.Must(template.New(&#34;qr&#34;).Parse(templateStr))

func main() {
    flag.Parse()
    http.Handle(&#34;/&#34;, http.HandlerFunc(QR))
    err := http.ListenAndServe(*addr, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(&#34;ListenAndServe:&#34;, err)
    }
}

func QR(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    templ.Execute(w, req.FormValue(&#34;s&#34;))
}

const templateStr = `
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;QR Link Generator&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
{{if .}}
&lt;img src=&#34;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=300x300&amp;cht=qr&amp;choe=UTF-8&amp;chl={{.}}&#34; /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{.}}
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{end}}
&lt;form action=&#34;/&#34; name=f method=&#34;GET&#34;&gt;
    &lt;input maxLength=1024 size=70 name=s value=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Text to QR Encode&#34;&gt;
    &lt;input type=submit value=&#34;Show QR&#34; name=qr&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
`
</pre>
</div>


<p>
The pieces up to <code>main</code> should be easy to follow.
The one flag sets a default HTTP port for our server.  The template
variable <code>templ</code> is where the fun happens. It builds an HTML template
that will be executed by the server to display the page; more about
that in a moment.
</p>
<p>
The <code>main</code> function parses the flags and, using the mechanism
we talked about above, binds the function <code>QR</code> to the root path
for the server.  Then <code>http.ListenAndServe</code> is called to start the
server; it blocks while the server runs.
</p>
<p>
<code>QR</code> just receives the request, which contains form data, and
executes the template on the data in the form value named <code>s</code>.
</p>
<p>
The template package <code>html/template</code> is powerful;
this program just touches on its capabilities.
In essence, it rewrites a piece of HTML text on the fly by substituting elements derived
from data items passed to <code>templ.Execute</code>, in this case the
form value.
Within the template text (<code>templateStr</code>),
double-brace-delimited pieces denote template actions.
The piece from <code>{{if .}}</code>
to <code>{{end}}</code> executes only if the value of the current data item, called <code>.</code> (dot),
is non-empty.
That is, when the string is empty, this piece of the template is suppressed.
</p>
<p>
The two snippets <code>{{.}}</code> say to show the data presented to
the template—the query string—on the web page.
The HTML template package automatically provides appropriate escaping so the
text is safe to display.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the template string is just the HTML to show when the page loads.
If this is too quick an explanation, see the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/html/template/">documentation</a>
for the template package for a more thorough discussion.
</p>
<p>
And there you have it: a useful web server in a few lines of code plus some
data-driven HTML text.
Go is powerful enough to make a lot happen in a few lines.

<p>I’m so smitten with learning that I fear I may be addicted to it. Imagine my delight when I learned about <em>How To Solve It</em> – a book about the very nature of learning how to solve problems. Written in 1945 by noted Hungarian mathematician George Pólya, <em>How To Solve It</em> is a book written for math students on how to solve math problems, but it was equally written for math teachers on how to teach them to do so.</p>



<p><em>How To Solve It </em>is not just a book about math but is actually a book about how to solve problems – any problems – and it became the foundation for the field of heuristics. Based on Polya’s prodigious knowledge and historic research, the book has a curious structure, with several introductions to the book, an outline of his four-step framework for solving problems, and then a dictionary of heuristics: which is actually an explanation of 67 different concepts to aid in solving problems.</p>

<p>For a math book, its is a joy to read. Polya’s voice is funny, knowing, and sincere. You can tell he spent years in the classroom coaching students of all kinds, and while the book is absolutely about math, it is equally universal, as he said In the late 1960s: <em>“I believe the most important part of thinking that is developed in mathematics is the right attitude in tackling and solving problems. We have problems in everyday life. We have problems in science. We have problems in politics. We have problems everywhere. The right attitude for problem solving may be slightly different from one domain to another, but we have only one head, and therefore it is natural that there should be one general set of tactics to tackling all kinds of problems. My personal opinion is that the main point in mathematics teaching is to develop these tactics of problem solving.”</em></p>



<p>For the majority of the book Polya teaches his process by solving geometry examples or finding patterns in number sequences but often switches it up using non-math examples applying the same heuristic for solving a crossword puzzle or understanding ancient Egyptian engineering. It’s here that <em>How to Solve It </em>really comes into its own, as Polya’s method results in a series of questions that can be applied to almost any problem. </p>



<p>After reading (and re-reading) <em>How to Solve It</em>, I think Polya’s heuristics can absolutely help our thinking in unraveling problems in data visualization. This (rather long) article is split into 4 parts. I present my analysis of the book before an explanation of the concepts because I didn’t want to get lost in too many details – and there are a lot of them. Part II focuses on the book and process itself, Part III on it’s legacy, and Part IV is a very long annotated list of the 64 heuristics terms, concepts, and key protagonists. </p>



<p><strong>Before I get into the details, here’s the whole book – read it for yourself! <a href="https://notendur.hi.is/hei2/teaching/Polya_HowToSolveIt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://notendur.hi.is/hei2/teaching/Polya_HowToSolveIt.pdf</a></strong></p>







<p><strong>Part I: Analysis of Polya’s heuristic methodology</strong></p>



<p><strong>Polya’s process versus design thinking</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been reading <em>How to Solve It</em> as a supplement to guiding the design process. While math and data are connected, mathematics and design have hardly been cozy. It’s interesting to consider Polya’s process of solving mathematical problems in comparison to design thinking. </p>



<p><em>How to Solve It</em> was written and published in Zurich in 1940 before the first English language version was published in 1945. Design thinking evolved in the 1960s as an approach to exploring production issues in industrial design, but both arguably drew from the same well of the scientific method with similar outcomes.  </p>



<p>Polya’s method takes us inside the creative process by establishing a series of questions to understand the problem – which, for our needs, I think of as the communications objective. Polya puts more emphasis on the earliest phase of the discovery process, focusing on learning, research, and understanding the goal (and data) before the mechanics of doing the work and testing for accuracy.</p>



<p>The discovery phase in design thinking has evolved into <a href="https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking-resources">a loosely collected series of design exercises</a> by whole industries of practitioners to discover the right solution to the right problem. These exercises largely crowd-source the research and problem solving which inevitably results in a degree of groupthink as an outcome. The actual creative process may be supported through these kinds of design thinking exercises, but it’s just not the same thing. Hopefully the iterative process catches any group-think indulgences through prototyping and testing the result with users – or at least it should.</p>



<p>It’s certainly arguable that Polya’s heuristics may not be as comparable to the wide range of “wicked problems” that design thinking is usually used for, but certainly, the same kind of mindset is at play.  Where design thinking is largely used to understand complex problems, Polya is codifying the types of internal questions that manifest through the creative process itself. </p>



<p>For example, the Double Diamond approach is a standard way of thinking about the 4 phases of design thinking. The diamond represents a series of diverging and converging activities to complete a project or task. After playing around with it for a while, I’ve come to think of Polya’s process as more of a staircase up through the Problem phases of the Double Diamond approach while the second and third steps – devising a plan &amp; carrying out a plan – are 2 sides of the same coin, as the planning of the act and the follow-through result in the 4th step – Checking/Looking back. Stating it more colloquially, once you understood the problem, and figured out to solve it, it’s all downhill from there.</p>

<p>What does it all mean? Well, I think Polya’s method could be more effective for small groups or individuals as it takes less input from others and establishes a framework to translate the data and design to known patterns and semiotics of visual culture. </p>



<p><strong>How might Polya’s heuristic process fit into a dataviz methodology? </strong></p>



<p>Data visualization is light on process and I loved reading this book in search of clues to how we might use these heuristics to make our work better, more intuitive, or more creative. Polya again makes an apt comment: <em>“Mathematics is interesting in so far as it occupies our reasoning and inventive powers… To make such steps comprehensible by suitable remarks or by carefully chosen questions and suggestions takes a lot of time and effort; but it may be worthwhile.” </em></p>







<p><strong>Part II:</strong> <strong>Polya’s method</strong></p>



<p>Ok, let’s dig into the actual book. Here’s an outline directly from the beginning of the book. </p>


<div>
<figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gD4taLqS1NZksS495DeTRv8bgcJYv9PvoncLWfh93Kmhac4oB8Q_mHVSuO2-UvtF_ZHUioengRhz9KJ_eivrZnXAsWmiuz4wPoiGBk6o5k0fbZ-n4ZN1H8qDh7fhfDbapjhBg5-KxXxfPAO3LiQZnx721IVhk7NdxNel3PZrmSaoDWaW9U4uQSVw_LWP0g" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"/></figure></div>


<p>Here’s a summarized text version (which I tweaked a smidge):</p>



<p><strong> 1. Understand the Problem </strong></p>



<ol>
<li>What do you know?</li>



<li>What don’t you know?</li>



<li>Draw a diagram of the problem and notate the various parts.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>2. Devise a Plan</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>What associations does the problem remind you of? What kinds of similar problems can you think of?</li>



<li>Can you decompose the problem or think of it differently?</li>



<li>Can you add auxiliary information to make sense of the problem?</li>



<li>If you can’t solve the problem, can you solve a related problem? <em>(My favorite!)</em></li>
</ol>



<p><strong>3. Carry Out the Plan</strong></p>



<p>(Literally, do the math.)</p>



<p><strong>4. Look Back</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Can you check the result? </li>



<li>Does your answer make sense?</li>



<li>Can you use your solution for something else?</li>
</ul>



<p>After this, Polya spends the rest of the book walking through the 67 heuristics. I’ll post an annotated list at the end (in part IV), but there are many wonderful concepts nested between the math-solving approaches.</p>



<p><em>In addition, </em>Polya also explains the nature of heuristics:</p>



<p><em>The aim of heuristic[s] is to study the methods and rules of discovery and invention…</em> </p>



<p>as well as<em> </em>heuristic reasoning:</p>



<p><em>…not regarded as final and strict but as provisional, …whose purpose is to discover the solution of the present problem. </em></p>



<p>Throughout the book, Polya’s method is used over and over again as a question-and-answer format to reveal the structured nature of the process. While this may feel obvious for some, the rigor of the approach is refreshing as it gives voice to the natural process many of us lean on to help us untangle the messy world around us. Understanding the power of analogy, research, composition and decomposition, validation, and even chance events is somehow reassuring as defined.</p>







<p><strong>PART III: The legacy of <em>How to Solve It</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Teaching as a way of living</strong></p>



<p>In the late 1960s, Polya was <a href="https://www.cmc-math.org/george-polya">speaking on his process to a class of elementary school math teachers</a>. His comments were delivered with the same precise and clever voice found in the book. He speaks a lot about how kids can be mentally engaged with math through practice and then passes along a list of ideas for teachers to do the same: </p>

<p><em>Teaching is not a science; it is an art. If teaching were a science there would be a best way of teaching and everyone would have to teach like that. Since teaching is not a science, there is great latitude and much possibility for personal differences. In an old British manual there was the following sentence, “Whatever the subject, what the teacher really teaches is himself.” </em></p>



<p>This really resonates with me, so I’ve adjusted it substituting the word ‘teaching’ for ‘dataviz:’</p>



<p><em>[Dataviz] is not a science; it is an art. If [dataviz] were a science there would be a best way of teaching and everyone would have to [practice] like that. Since [dataviz] is not a science, there is great latitude and much possibility for personal differences. In an old British manual there was the following sentence, “Whatever the subject, what the [practitioner] really [designs] is [themselves].” </em></p>



<p>Polya also lists out some general advice, and again, I think this is directly relevant for us as dataviz practitioners: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Be interested in your subject.</em></li>



<li><em>Know your subject.</em></li>



<li><em>Know about the ways of learning: The best way to learn anything is to discover it by yourself.</em></li>



<li><em>Try to read the faces of your students, try to see their expectations and difficulties, put yourself in their place.</em></li>



<li><em>Give them not only information, but ‘know-how,’ attitudes of mind, the habit of methodical work.</em></li>



<li><em>Look out for such features of the problem at hand as may be useful in solving the problems to come — try to disclose the general pattern that lies behind the present concrete situation.</em></li>



<li><em>Do not give away your whole secret at once – let the students guess before you tell it – let them find out by themselves as much as is feasible.</em></li>



<li><em>Suggest it, do not force it down their throats.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>What we design, what we share with others, is rarely the subject matter of our design and insights, but rather a reflection of who we are as people. Polya’s humanism radiates with the care of a teacher’s fondness for the future. As Polya says, “Teaching to solve problems is education of the will,” and I wonder if that isn’t a life lesson for all of us.</p>



<p><strong><em>How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics</em></strong></p>



<p>The influence of Polya’s book has rippled across fields of study. <strong> </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">Heuristics</a> is now a practice that can be seen across many fields – chiefly in cognitive psychology, philosophy, economics, and computer science/AI research. </p>



<p>Zbigniew Michalewicz and David B. Fogel’s well-known book on modern heuristics for algorithm design even nabs the title from Polya. Their book, <em>How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics</em> begins, <em>“Gyorgy Polya’s How to Solve It stands as one of the most important contributions to the problem-solving literature in the twentieth century. Even now, as we move into the new millennium, the book continues to be a favorite among teachers and students for its instructive heuristics…  Essentially, the book is an encyclopedia of problem-solving methods to be carried out by hand, but more than that, it is a treatise on how to think about framing and attacking problems.”</em></p>



<p>As I said, I’ve been reading <em>How to Solve It</em> as a supplement to guiding the design process for dataviz. It’s our process that helps us to accomplish how we help others understand the story of the data. Polya’s technique may be a further rubric to guide us on our creative journey.</p>



<p>Does Polya’s logic fit into a dataviz mindset? Will these ideas resonate with our community? Could an augmented version of <em>How to Solve It</em> be re-conceived for individuals following a design thinking approach? </p>



<p>What do you think? I’ve outlined a lot of ideas in this article, but let’s talk about it! Add your comments on social media or email me! I’d love to discuss it more!</p>

<p><strong>Part IV: Selected quotes from “A SHORT DICTIONARY OF HEURISTICS”</strong></p>



<p>In case you want to learn more, I’ll include selected quotes from Polya across his 67 definitions of heuristics here. Certainly, I don’t expect anyone to read this cliff notes version as a stand-in for the original, but it’s probably much easier to scan through them to become acquainted with the concepts. Who knows – it might help you in your creative process or inspire your process!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Analogy</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Similar objects agree with each other in some respect, analogous objects agree in certain relations of their respective parts…</em></p>



<p><em>Analogy pervades all our thinking, our everyday speech and our trivial conclusions as well as artistic ways of expression and the highest scientific achievements. Analogy is used on very different levels. People often use vague, ambiguous, incomplete, or incompletely clarified analogies, but analogy may reach the level of mathematical precision. All sorts of analogy may play a role in the discovery of the solution and so we should not neglect any sort.</em></p>



<p><em>Inference by analogy appears to be the most common kind of conclusion, and it is possibly the most essential kind. It yields more or less plausible conjectures which may or may not be confirmed by experience and stricter reasoning. The chemist, experimenting on animals in order to foresee the influence of his drugs on humans, draws conclusions by analogy. But so did a small boy I knew. His pet dog had to be taken to the veterinary, and he inquired:</em></p>



<p><em>“Who is the veterinary?”</em></p>



<p><em>“The animal doctor.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Which animal is the animal doctor?”</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Auxiliary elements</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>There are various reasons for introducing auxiliary elements. We are glad when we have succeeded in recollecting a problem related to ours and solved before. It is probable that we can use such a problem but we do not know yet how to use it. For instance, the problem which we are trying to solve is a geometric problem, and the related problem which we have solved before and have now succeeded in recollecting is a problem about triangles. Yet there is no triangle in our figure; in order to make any use of the problem recollected we must have a triangle; therefore, we have to introduce one, by adding suitable auxiliary lines to our figure. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Auxiliary problem</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>… a problem which we consider, not for its own sake, but because we hope that its consideration may help us to solve another problem, our original problem. The original problem is the end we wish to attain, the auxiliary problem a means by which we try to attain our end.</em></p>



<p><em>Yet we should not fail to look around for more good problems when we have succeeded in solving one. Good problems and mushrooms of certain kinds have something in common; they grow in clusters. Having found one, you should look around; there is a good chance that there are some more quite near.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bolzano, Bernard (1781-1848)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>He writes about this part of his work: “I do not think at all that I am able to present here any procedure of investigation that was not perceived long ago by all men of talent; and I do not promise at all that you can find here anything quite new of this kind. But I shall take pains to state in clear words the rules and ways of investigation which are followed by all able men, who in most cases are not even conscious of following them. Although I am free from the illusion that I shall fully succeed even in doing this, I still hope that the little that is presented here may please some people and have some application afterwards.”</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bright idea</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>…or “good idea,” or “seeing the light,” is a colloquial expression describing a sudden advance toward the solution. The coming of a bright idea is an experience familiar to everybody but difficult to describe…</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Can you check the result?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>It is clear that our nonmathematical knowledge cannot be based entirely on formal proofs. The more solid part of our everyday knowledge is continually tested and strengthened by our everyday experience. Tests by observation are more systematically conducted in the natural sciences. Such tests take the form of careful experiments and measurements, and are combined with mathematical reasoning in the physical sciences. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Can you derive the result differently?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>When the solution that we have finally obtained is long and involved, we naturally suspect that there is some clearer and less roundabout solution: Can you derive the result differently? Can you see it at a glance?… Having found a proof, we wish to find another proof as we wish to touch an object after having seen it.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Can you use the result?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Exploit your success! Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Carrying out</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>To conceive a plan and to carry it through are two different things.</em></p>



<p><em>We may use provisional and merely plausible arguments when devising the final and rigorous argument as we use scaffolding to support a bridge during construction. When, however, the work is sufficiently advanced we take off the scaffolding, and the bridge should be able to stand by itself. In the same way, when the solution is sufficiently advanced, we brush aside all kinds of provisional and merely plausible arguments, and the result should be supported by rigorous argument alone.</em></p>



<p><em>In short, the new unknown should be a sort of stepping stone. A stone in the middle of the creek is nearer to me than the other bank which I wish to arrive at and, when the stone is reached, it helps me on toward the other bank.</em></p>



<p><em>Trying to prove formally what is seen intuitively and to see intuitively what is proved formally is an invigorating mental exercise. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Condition</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>A condition is called redundant if it contains superfluous parts. It is called contradictory if its parts are mutually opposed and inconsistent so that there is no object satisfying the condition.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Contradictory</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Thus, if a condition is expressed by more linear equations than there are unknowns, it is either redundant or contradictory; if the condition is expressed by fewer equations than there are unknowns, it is insufficient to determine the unknowns; if the condition is expressed by just as many equations as there are unknowns it is usually just sufficient to determine the unknowns but may be, in exceptional cases, contradictory or insufficient.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Corollary</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>a theorem which we find easily in examining another theorem just found. The word is of Latin origin; a more literal translation would be “gratuity” or “tip.”</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Could you derive something useful from the data?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>We have to find the connection between the data and the unknown. We may represent our unsolved problem as open space between the data and the unknown, as a gap across which we have to construct a bridge. We can start constructing our bridge from either side, from the unknown or from the data.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Could you restate the problem?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>These questions aim at suitable VARIATION OF THE PROBLEM.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Decomposing and recombining</strong>
<ul></ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><em>You have an impression of the object as a whole but this impression, possibly, is not definite enough. A detail strikes you, and you focus your attention upon it. Then, you concentrate upon another detail; then, again, upon another. Various combinations of details may present themselves and after a while, you again consider the object as a whole but you see it now differently. You decompose the whole into its parts, and you recombine the parts into a more or less different whole.</em></p>



<p><em>If you go into detail you may lose yourself in details. Too many or too minute particulars are a burden on the mind. They may prevent you from giving sufficient attention to the main point, or even from seeing the main point at all. Think of the man who cannot see the forest for the trees.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, we do not wish to waste our time with unnecessary detail and we should reserve our effort for the essential. The difficulty is that we cannot say beforehand which details will turn out ultimately as necessary and which will not.</em></p>



<p><em>Therefore, let us, first of all, understand the problem as a whole. Having understood the problem, we shall be in a better position to judge which particular points may be the most essential. Having examined one or two essential points we shall be in a better position to judge which further details might deserve closer examination. </em></p>



<p><em>After having decomposed the problem, we try to recombine its elements in some new manner. Especially, we may try to recombine the elements of the problem into some new, more accessible problem which we could possibly use as an auxiliary problem.</em></p>



<p><em>There are, of course, unlimited possibilities of recombination. Difficult problems demand hidden, exceptional, original combinations, and the ingenuity of the problem-solver shows itself in the originality of the combination. There are, however, certain usual and relatively simple sorts of combinations, sufficient for simpler problems, which we should know thoroughly and try first, even if we may be obliged eventually to resort to less obvious means.</em></p>



<p><em>There is a formal classification in which the most usual and useful combinations are neatly placed. In constructing a new problem from the proposed problem, we may</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>…a term is a statement of its meaning in other terms which are supposed to be well known</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Descartes, René (1596-1650)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>…great mathematician and philosopher, planned to give a universal method to solve problems but he left unfinished his Rules for the Direction of the Mind. The fragments of this treatise, found in his manuscripts and printed after his death, contain more—and more interesting—materials concerning the solution of problems than his better known work Discours de la Méthode although the “Discours” was very likely written after the “Rules.” The following lines of Descartes seem to describe the origin of the “Rules”: “As a young man, when I heard about ingenious inventions, I tried to invent them by myself, even without reading the author. In doing so, I perceived, by degrees, that I was making use of certain rules.”</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Determination, hope, success</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>It would be a mistake to think that solving problems is a purely “intellectual affair”; determination and emotions play an important role. Lukewarm determination and sleepy consent to do a little something may be enough for a routine problem in the classroom. But, to solve a serious scientific problem, will power is needed that can outlast years of toil and bitter disappointments.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>We are here particularly concerned with the student’s efficiency in solving problems. How can we characterize it? We may derive some profit from the distinction of the four phases of the solution. In fact, the behavior of the students in the various phases is quite characteristic.</em></p>



<p><em>Incomplete understanding of the problem, owing to lack of concentration, is perhaps the most widespread deficiency in solving problems. With respect to devising a plan and obtaining a general idea of the solution two opposite faults are frequent. Some students rush into calculations and constructions without any plan or general idea; others wait clumsily for some idea to come and cannot do anything that would accelerate its coming. In carrying out the plan, the most frequent fault is carelessness, lack of patience in checking each step. Failure to check the result at all is very frequent; the student is glad to get an answer, throws down his pencil, and is not shocked by the most unlikely results.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Did you use all the data?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Have we got what we need? Is our conception adequate? Did you use all the data? Did you use the whole condition? </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Do you know a related problem?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>In fact, when solving a problem, we always profit from previously solved problems, using their result, or their method, or the experience we acquired solving them. And, of course, the problems from which we profit must be in some way related to our present problem.</em></p>



<p><em>There is usually no difficulty at all in recalling formerly solved problems which are more or less related to our present one. On the contrary, we may find too many such problems and there may be difficulty in choosing a useful one. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Draw a figure</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>The beginner should construct as many figures as they can in order to acquire a good experimental basis… Yet, for the purpose of reasoning, carefully drawn free-hand figures are usually good enough, and they are much more quickly done. Of course, the figure should not look absurd; lines supposed to be straight should not be wavy, and so-called circles should not look like potatoes.</em></p>



<p><em>If there are many details, we cannot imagine all of them simultaneously, but they are all together on the paper. A detail pictured in our imagination may be forgotten; but the detail traced on paper remains, and, when we come back to it, it reminds us of our previous remarks, it saves us some of the trouble we have in recollecting our previous consideration.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Examine your guess</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Your guess may be right, but it is foolish to accept a vivid guess as a proven truth—as primitive people often do. Your guess may be wrong. But it is also foolish to disregard a vivid guess altogether—as pedantic people sometimes do. Guesses of a certain kind deserve to be examined and taken seriously: those which occur to us after we have attentively considered and really understood a problem in which we are genuinely interested. Such guesses usually contain at least a fragment of the truth although, of course, they very seldom show the whole truth. Yet there is a chance to extract the whole truth if we examine such a guess appropriately.</em></p>



<p><em>Many a guess has turned out to be wrong but nevertheless useful in leading to a better one.</em></p>



<p><em>No idea is really bad unless we are uncritical. What is really bad is to have no idea at all.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Figures</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Figures are not only the object of geometric problems but also an important help for all sorts of problems in which there is nothing geometric at the outset. Thus, we have two good reasons to consider the role of figures in solving problems.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Generalization</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Passing from the consideration of one object to the consideration of a set containing that object; or passing from the consideration of a restricted set to that of a more comprehensive set containing the restricted one.</em></p>



<p><em>The more general problem may be easier to solve. This sounds paradoxical but, after the foregoing example, it should not be paradoxical to us. The main achievement in solving the special problem was to invent the general problem. After the main achievement, only a minor part of the work remains. Thus, in our case, the solution of the general problem is only a minor part of the solution of the special problem.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Have you seen it before?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>It is possible that we have solved before the same problem that we have to do now, or that we have heard of it, or that we had a very similar problem. These are possibilities which we should not fail to explore. We try to remember what happened. Have you seen it before? Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form? Even if the answer is negative such questions may start the mobilization of useful knowledge.</em></p>



<p><em>….We cannot know, of course, in advance which parts of our knowledge may be relevant; but there are certain possibilities which we should not fail to explore. Thus, any feature of the present problem that played a role in the solution of some other problem may play again a role. Therefore, if any feature of the present problem strikes us as possibly important, we try to recognize it. What is it? Is it familiar to you?</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Here is a problem related to yours and solved before</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>This is good news; a problem for which the solution is known and which is connected with our present problem, is certainly welcome. It is still more welcome if the connection is close and the solution simple. There is a good chance that such a problem will be useful in solving our present one.</em></p>



<p><em>The intention of using a certain formerly solved problem influences our conception of the present problem. Trying to link up the two problems, the new and the old, we introduce into the new problem elements corresponding to certain important elements of the old problem. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Heuristic</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>…or “ars inveniendi” was the name of a certain branch of study, not very clearly circumscribed, belonging to logic, or to philosophy, or to psychology, often outlined, seldom presented in detail, and as good as forgotten today. The aim of heuristic is to study the methods and rules of discovery and invention. A few traces of such study may be found in the commentators of Euclid; a passage of PAPPUS is particularly interesting in this respect. The most famous attempts to build up a system of heuristic are due to DESCARTES and to LEIBNITZ, both great mathematicians and philosophers. Bernard BOLZANO presented a notable detailed account of heuristic. The present booklet is an attempt to revive heuristic in a modern and modest form. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Heuristic reasoning</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Reasoning not regarded as final and strict but as provisional and plausible only, whose purpose is to discover the solution of the present problem. We are often obliged to use heuristic reasoning. We shall attain complete certainty when we shall have obtained the complete solution, but before obtaining certainty we must often be satisfied with a more or less plausible guess. We may need the provisional before we attain the final. We need heuristic reasoning when we construct a strict proof as we need scaffolding when we erect a building.</em></p>



<p><em>Heuristic reasoning is good in itself. What is bad is to mix up heuristic reasoning with rigorous proof. What is worse is to sell heuristic reasoning for rigorous proof.</em></p>



<p><em>.…A heuristic argument presented with taste and frankness may be useful; it may prepare for the rigorous argument of which it usually contains certain germs. But a heuristic argument is likely to be harmful if it is presented ambiguously with visible hesitation between shame and pretension.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>If you cannot solve the proposed problem</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Do not let this failure afflict you too much but try to find consolation with some easier success, try to solve first some related problem; then you may find courage to attack your original problem again. Do not forget that human superiority consists in going around an obstacle that cannot be overcome directly, in devising some suitable auxiliary problem when the original one appears insoluble.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Induction and mathematical induction</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Induction is the process of discovering general laws by the observation and combination of particular instances. It is used in all sciences, even in mathematics. Mathematical induction is used in mathematics alone to prove theorems of a certain kind. It is rather unfortunate that the names are connected because there is very little logical connection between the two processes. There is, however, some practical connection; we often use both methods together. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Inventor’s paradox</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>The more ambitious plan may have more chances of success.</em></p>



<p><em>This sounds paradoxical. Yet, when passing from one problem to another, we may often observe that the new, more ambitious problem is easier to handle than the original problem. More questions may be easier to answer than just one question. The more comprehensive theorem may be easier to prove, the more general problem may be easier to solve.</em></p>



<p><em>The paradox disappears if we look closer at a few examples. The more ambitious plan may have more chances of success provided it is not based on mere pretension but on some vision of the things beyond those immediately present.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Is it possible to satisfy the condition?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>It is good to foresee any feature of the result for which we work. When we have some idea of what we can expect, we know better in which direction we should go. Now, an important feature of a problem is the number of solutions of which it admits. Most interesting among problems are those which admit of just one solution; we are inclined to consider problems with a uniquely determined solution as the only “reasonable” problems. Is our problem, in this sense, “reasonable”? If we can answer this question, even by a plausible guess, our interest in the problem increases and we can work better.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Leibnitz, Gottfried Wilhelm (1646-1716)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Great mathematician and philosopher, planned to write an “Art of Invention” but he never carried through his plan. Numerous fragments dispersed in his works show, however, that he entertained interesting ideas about the subject whose importance he often emphasized. Thus, he wrote: “Nothing is more important than to see the sources of invention which are, in my opinion, more interesting than the inventions themselves.”</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lemma</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Lemma means “auxiliary theorem.” The word is of Greek origin; a more literal translation would be “what is assumed.”</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Look at the unknown</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>This is old advice; the corresponding Latin saying is: “respice finem.” That is, look at the end. Remember your aim. Do not forget your goal. Think of what you are desiring to obtain. Do not lose sight of what is required. Keep in mind what you are working for. Look at the unknown. Look at the conclusion. The last two versions of “respice finem” are specifically adapted to mathematical problems, to “problems to find” and to “problems to prove” respectively.</em></p>



<p><em>Focusing our attention on our aim and concentrating our will on our purpose, we think of ways and means to attain it. What are the means to this end? How can you attain your aim? How can you obtain a result of this kind? What causes could produce such a result? Where have you seen such a result produced? What do people usually do to obtain such a result? And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown. And try to think of a familiar theorem having the same or a similar conclusion. Again, the last two versions are specifically adapted to “problems to find” and to “problems to prove” respectively.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Modern heuristic</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>…endeavors to understand the process of solving problems, especially the mental operations typically useful in this process… Experience in solving problems and experience in watching other people solving problems must be the basis on which heuristic is built. In this study, we should not neglect any sort of problem, and should find out common features in the way of handling all sorts of problems; we should aim at general features, independent of the subject matter of the problem. The study of heuristic has “practical” aims; a better understanding of the mental operations typically useful in solving problems could exert some good influence on teaching, especially on the teaching of mathematics.</p>

<p><em>Speaking and thinking are closely connected, the use of words assists the mind. Certain philosophers and philologists went a little further and asserted that the use of words is indispensable to the use of reason.</em></p>



<p><em>Speaking and thinking are closely connected, the use of words assists the mind. Certain philosophers and philologists went a little further and asserted that the use of words is indispensable to the use of reason.</em></p>



<p><em>Signs must be, first of all, unambiguous. It is inadmissible that the same symbol denote two different objects in the same inquiry. If, solving a problem, you call a certain magnitude a you should avoid calling anything else a which is connected with the same problem. Of course, you may use the letter a in a different meaning in a different problem.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pappus</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>…an important Greek mathematician, lived probably around A.D. 300. In the seventh book of his Collectiones, Pappus reports about a branch of study which he calls analyomenos. We can render this name in English as “Treasury of Analysis,” or as “Art of Solving Problems,” or even as “Heuristic”; the last term seems to be preferable here. A good English translation of Pappus’s report is easily accessible7; what follows is a free rendering of the original text:</em></p>



<p><em>“The so-called Heuristic is, to put it shortly, a special body of doctrine for the use of those who, after having studied the ordinary Elements, are desirous of acquiring the ability to solve mathematical problems, and it is useful for this alone. It is the work of three men, Euclid, the author of the Elements, Apollonius of Perga, and Aristaeus the elder. It teaches the procedures of analysis and synthesis.</em></p>



<p><em>“In analysis, we start from what is required, we take it for granted, and we draw consequences from it, and consequences from the consequences, till we reach a point that we can use as starting point in synthesis. For in analysis we assume what is required to be done as already done (what is sought as already found, what we have to prove as true). We inquire from what antecedent the desired result could be derived; then we inquire again what could be the antecedent of that antecedent, and so on, until passing from antecedent to antecedent, we come eventually upon something already known or admittedly true. This procedure we call analysis, or solution backwards, or regressive reasoning.</em></p>



<p><em>“But in synthesis, reversing the process, we start from the point which we reached last of all in the analysis, from the thing already known or admittedly true. We derive from it what preceded it in the analysis, and go on making derivations until, retracing our steps, we finally succeed in arriving at what is required. This procedure we call synthesis, or constructive solution, or progressive reasoning.</em></p>



<p><em>“Now analysis is of two kinds; the one is the analysis of the ‘problems to prove’ and aims at establishing true theorems; the other is the analysis of the ‘problems to find’ and aims at finding the unknown.</em></p>



<p><em>“If we have a ‘problem to prove’ we are required to prove or disprove a clearly stated theorem A. We do not know yet whether A is true or false; but we derive from A another theorem B, from B another C, and so on, until we come upon a last theorem L about which we have definite knowledge. If L is true, A will be also true, provided that all our derivations are convertible. From L we prove the theorem K which preceded L in the analysis and, proceding in the same way, we retrace our steps; from C we prove B, from B we prove A, and so we attain our aim. If, however, L is false, we have proved A false.</em></p>



<p><em>“If we have a ‘problem to find’ we are required to find a certain unknown x satisfying a clearly stated condition. We do not know yet whether a thing satisfying such a condition is possible or not; but assuming that there is an x satisfying the condition imposed we derive from it another unknown y which has to satisfy a related condition; then we link y to still another unknown, and so on, until we come upon a last unknown z which we can find by some known method. If there is actually a z satisfying the condition imposed upon it, there will be also an x satisfying the original condition, provided that all our derivations are convertible. We first find z; then, knowing z, we find the unknown that preceded z in the analysis; proceeding in the same way, we retrace our steps, and finally, knowing y, we obtain x, and so we attain our aim. If, however, there is nothing that would satisfy the condition imposed upon z, the problem concerning x has no solution.”</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pedantry and mastery</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>To apply a rule to the letter, rigidly, unquestioningly, in cases where it fits and in cases where it does not fit, is pedantry. Some pedants are poor fools; they never did understand the rule which they apply so conscientiously and so indiscriminately. Some pedants are quite successful; they understood their rule, at least in the beginning (before they became pedants), and chose a good one that fits in many cases and fails only occasionally.</em></p>



<p><em>To apply a rule with natural ease, with judgment, noticing the cases where it fits, and without ever letting the words of the rule obscure the purpose of the action or the opportunities of the situation, is mastery.</em></p>



<p><em>The questions and suggestions of our list may be helpful both to problem-solvers and to teachers. But, first, they must be understood, their proper use must be learned, and learned by trial and error, by failure and success, by experience in applying them. Second, their use should never become pedantic. You should ask no question, make no suggestion, indiscriminately, following some rigid habit. Be prepared for various questions and suggestions and use your judgment. You are doing a hard and exciting problem; the step you are going to try next should be prompted by an attentive and open-minded consideration of the problem before you. You wish to help a student; what you say to your student should proceed from a sympathetic understanding of his difficulties.</em></p>



<p><em>And if you are inclined to be a pedant and must rely upon some rule learn this one: Always use your own brains first.</em></p>



<p><em>Teaching to solve problems is education of the will. Solving problems which are not too easy for him, the student learns to persevere through unsuccess, to appreciate small advances, to wait for the essential idea, to concentrate with all his might when it appears. If the student had no opportunity in school to familiarize himself with the varying emotions of the struggle for the solution his mathematical education failed in the most vital point.</em></p>

<p><em>Practical problems are different in various respects from purely mathematical problems, yet the principal motives and procedures of the solution are essentially the same. </em></p>



<p><em>There is a widespread opinion that practical problems need more experience than mathematical problems. This may be so. Yet, very likely, the difference lies in the nature of the knowledge needed and not in our attitude toward the problem. In solving a problem of one or the other kind, we have to rely on our experience with similar problems and we often ask the questions: Have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form? Do you know a related problem?</em></p>



<p><em>In solving a mathematical problem, we start from very clear concepts which are fairly well ordered in our mind. In solving a practical problem, we are often obliged to start from rather hazy ideas; then, the clarification of the concepts may become an important part of the problem. Thus, medical science is in a better position to check infectious diseases today than it was in the times before Pasteur when the notion of infection itself was rather hazy. Have you taken into account all essential notions involved in the problem? This is a good question for all sorts of problems but its use varies widely with the nature of the intervening notions.</em></p>



<p><em>In a perfectly stated mathematical problem all data and all clauses of the condition are essential and must be taken into account. In practical problems we have a multitude of data and conditions; we take into account as many as we can but we are obliged to neglect some. Take the case of the designer of a large dam. He considers the public interest and important economic interests but he is bound to disregard certain petty claims and grievances. The data of his problem are, strictly speaking, inexhaustible. For instance, he would like to know a little more about the geologic nature of the ground on which the foundations must be laid, but eventually he must stop collecting geologic data although a certain margin of uncertainty unavoidably remains.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Problems to find, problems to prove</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>The aim of a “problem to find” is to find a certain object, the unknown of the problem.</em></p>



<p><em>The unknown is also called “quaesitum,” or the thing sought, or the thing required. “Problems to find” may be theoretical or practical, abstract or concrete, serious problems or mere puzzles. We may seek all sorts of unknowns; we may try to find, to obtain, to acquire, to produce, or to construct all imaginable kinds of objects. In the problem of the mystery story the unknown is a murderer. In a chess problem the unknown is a move of the chessmen. In certain riddles the unknown is a word. In certain elementary problems of algebra the unknown is a number. In a problem of geometric construction the unknown is a figure.</em></p>



<p><em>The principal parts of a “problem to find” are the unknown, the data, and the condition.</em></p>



<p><em>The aim of a “problem to prove” is to show conclusively that a certain clearly stated assertion is true, or else to show that it is false. We have to answer the question: Is this assertion true or false? And we have to answer conclusively, either by proving the assertion true, or by proving it false.</em></p>



<p><em>A witness affirms that the defendant stayed at home a certain night. The judge has to find out whether this assertion is true or not and, moreover, he has to give as good grounds as possible for his finding. Thus, the judge has a “problem to prove.” Another “problem to prove” is to “prove the theorem of Pythagoras.” We do not say: “Prove or disprove the theorem of Pythagoras.” It would be better in some respects to include in the statement of the problem the possibility of disproving, but we may neglect it, because we know that the chances for disproving the theorem of Pythagoras are rather slight.</em></p>



<p><em>If a “problem to prove” is a mathematical problem of the usual kind, its principal parts are the hypothesis and the conclusion of the theorem which has to be proved or disproved.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Progress and achievement</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Have you made any progress? What was the essential achievement? We may address questions of this kind to ourselves when we are solving a problem or to a student whose work we supervise. Thus, we are used to judge, more or less confidently, progress and achievement in concrete cases. The step from such concrete cases to a general description is not easy at all. Yet we have to undertake this step if we wish to make our study of heuristic somewhat complete and we must try to clarify what constitutes, in general, progress and achievement in solving problems.</em></p>



<p><em>…Another aspect of the progress of our work is that our mode of conception changes. Enriched with all the materials which we have recalled, adapted to it, and worked into it, our conception of the problem is much fuller at the end than it was at the outset. Desiring to proceed from our initial conception of the problem to a more adequate, better adapted conception, we try various standpoints and view the problem from different sides. </em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Puzzles</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>What the questions and suggestions of the list can do is to “keep the ball rolling.” When, discouraged by lack of success, we are inclined to drop the problem, they may suggest to us a new trial, a new aspect, a new variation of the problem, a new stimulus; they may keep us thinking.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reductio ad absurdum and indirect proof</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Reductio ad absurdum shows the falsity of an assumption by deriving from it a manifest absurdity. “Reduction to an absurdity” is a mathematical procedure but it has some resemblance to irony which is the favorite procedure of the satirist. Irony adopts, to all appearance, a certain opinion and stresses it and overstresses it till it leads to a manifest absurdity.</p>



<p>Indirect proof establishes the truth of an assertion by showing the falsity of the opposite assumption. Thus, indirect proof has some resemblance to a politician’s trick of establishing a candidate by demolishing the reputation of his opponent.</p>



<p>Both “reductio ad absurdum” and indirect proof are effective tools of discovery which present themselves naturally to an intent mind. Nevertheless, they are disliked by a few philosophers and many beginners, which is understandable; satirical people and tricky politicians do not appeal to everybody. We shall first illustrate the effectiveness of both procedures by examples and discuss objections against them afterwards.</p>



<p>It must be confessed that “reductio ad absurdum” as a means of exposition is not an unmixed blessing. Such a “reductio,” especially if it is long, may become very painful indeed for the reader or listener. All the derivations which we examine in succession are correct but all the situations which we have to face are impossible. Even the verbal expression may become tedious if it insists, as it should, on emphasizing that everything is based on an initial assumption; the words “hypothetically,” “supposedly,” “allegedly” must recur incessantly, or some other device must be applied continually. We wish to reject and forget the situation as impossible but we have to retain and examine it as the basis for the next step, and this inner discord may become unbearable in the long run.</p>



<p>Yet it would be foolish to repudiate “reductio ad absurdum” as a tool of discovery. It may present itself naturally and bring a decision when all other means seem to be exhausted as the foregoing examples may show.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Redundant</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>See CONDITION.</em> <em>{I can’t help but see this as a math joke – JF}</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Routine problem</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Routine problems, even many routine problems, may be necessary in teaching mathematics but to make the students do no other kind is inexcusable. Teaching the mechanical performance of routine mathematical operations and nothing else is well under the level of the cookbook because kitchen recipes do leave something to the imagination and judgment of the cook but mathematical recipes do not.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rules of discovery</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>The first rule of discovery is to have brains and good luck. The second rule of discovery is to sit tight and wait till you get a bright idea.</em></p>



<p><em>It may be good to be reminded somewhat rudely that certain aspirations are hopeless. Infallible rules of discovery leading to the solution of all possible mathematical problems would be more desirable than the philosophers’ stone, vainly sought by the alchemists. Such rules would work magic; but there is no such thing as magic. To find unfailing rules applicable to all sorts of problems is an old philosophical dream; but this dream will never be more than a dream.</em></p>



<p><em>A reasonable sort of heuristic cannot aim at unfailing rules; but it may endeavor to study procedures (mental operations, moves, steps) which are typically useful in solving problems. Such procedures are practiced by every sane person sufficiently interested in his problem. They are hinted by certain stereotyped questions and suggestions which intelligent people put to themselves and intelligent teachers to their students. A collection of such questions and suggestions, stated with sufficient generality and neatly ordered, may be less desirable than the philosophers’ stone but can be provided. The list we study provides such a collection.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rules of style</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>The first rule of style is to have something to say. The second rule of style is to control yourself when, by chance, you have two things to say; say first one, then the other, not both at the same time.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rules of teaching</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>The first rule of teaching is to know what you are supposed to teach. The second rule of teaching is to know a little more than what you are supposed to teach.</em></p>



<p><em>First things come first. The author of this book does not think that all rules of conduct for teachers are completely useless; otherwise, he would not have dared to write a whole book about the conduct of teachers and students. Yet it should not be forgotten that a teacher of mathematics should know some mathematics, and that a teacher wishing to impart the right attitude of mind toward problems to his students should have acquired that attitude himself.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Separate the various parts of the condition</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Our first duty is to understand the problem. Having understood the problem as a whole, we go into detail. We consider its principal parts, the unknown, the data, the condition, each by itself. When we have these parts well in mind but no particularly helpful idea has yet occurred to us, we go into further detail. We consider the various data, each datum by itself.</em></p>



<p><em>Having understood the condition as a whole, we separate its various parts, and we consider each part by itself.</em></p>



<p><em>We see now the role of the suggestion that we have to discuss here. It tends to provoke a step that we have to take when we are trying to see the problem distinctly and have to go into finer and finer detail. It is a step in DECOMPOSING AND RECOMBINING.</em></p>



<p><em>Separate the various parts of the condition. Can you write them down? We often have opportunity to ask this question when we are SETTING UP EQUATIONS.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Setting up equations</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>To set up equations means to express in mathematical symbols a condition that is stated in words; it is translation from ordinary language into the language of mathematical formulas. The difficulties which we may have in setting up equations are difficulties of translation.</em></p>



<p><em>In order to translate a sentence from English into French two things are necessary. First, we must understand thoroughly the English sentence. Second, we must be familiar with the forms of expression peculiar to the French language. The situation is very similar when we attempt to express in mathematical symbols a condition proposed in words. First, we must understand thoroughly the condition. Second, we must be familiar with the forms of mathematical expression.</em></p>



<p><em>It is very much the same in setting up equations. In easy cases, the verbal statement splits almost automatically into successive parts, each of which can be immediately written down in mathematical symbols. In more difficult cases, the condition has parts which cannot be immediately translated into mathematical symbols. If this is so, we must pay less attention to the verbal statement, and concentrate more upon the meaning. Before we start writing formulas, we may have to rearrange the condition, and we should keep an eye on the resources of mathematical notation while doing so.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Signs</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><em>As Columbus and his companions sailed westward across an unknown ocean they were cheered whenever they saw birds. They regarded a bird as a favorable sign, indicating the nearness of land. But in this they were repeatedly disappointed. They watched for other signs too. They thought that floating seaweed or low banks of cloud might indicate land, but they were again disappointed. One day, however, the signs multiplied. On Thursday, the 11th of October, 1492, “they saw sandpipers, and a green reed near the ship. Those of the caravel Pinta saw a cane and a pole, and they took up another small pole which appeared to have been worked by iron; also another bit of cane, a land-plant, and a small board. The crew of the caravel Niña also saw signs of land, and a small branch covered with berries. Everyone breathed afresh and rejoiced at these signs.” And in fact the next day they sighted land, the first island of a New World.</em></p>



<p><em>Our undertaking may be important or unimportant, our problem of any kind—when we are working intensely, we watch eagerly for signs of progress as Columbus and his companions watched for signs of approaching land. We shall discuss a few examples in order to understand what can be reasonably regarded as a sign of approaching the solution.</em></p>



<p><em>In a well-constructed chess problem there is no superfluous piece. Therefore, we have to take into account all chessmen on the board; we have to use all the data. The correct solution does certainly use all the pieces, even that apparently superfluous white knight. In this last respect, the new move that I contemplate agrees with the correct move that I am supposed to find. The new move looks like the correct move; it might be the correct move.</em></p>
