As a EE, it was cool meeting him the first time and once I&#39;d chatted with him a few times, I finally asked the question I&#39;d been dying to ask: How&#39;d you come up with &#34;Metcalfe&#39;s Law&#34;?<p>Metcalfe&#39;s Law states the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of devices of the system.</p><p>When I finally asked him, he looked at me and said &#34;I made it up.&#34;</p><p>Me: .. what?</p><p>Him: I was selling network cards and I wanted people to buy more.</p><p>Me: .. what?</p><p>Him: If I could convince someone to buy 4 instead of 2, that was great. So I told them buying more made each of them more valuable.</p><p>It was mind blowing because so many other things were built on that &#34;law&#34; that began as a sales pitch. Lots of people have proven out &#34;more nodes are more valuable&#34; but that&#39;s where it started.</p><p>He also tells a story about declining a job with Steve Jobs to start 3Com and Steve later coming to his wedding. He also shared a scan of his original pitch deck for 3Com which was a set of transparencies because Powerpoint hadn&#39;t been invented yet. I think I kept a copy of it..

I even got to do the Twilio 5 Minute Demo for one of his classes (circa 2012).</p><p>It was always cool to have someone who shaped our industry just hanging out and chatting with people.

                  <p><span>Absolutely correct. Chatted with him several times circa 2015 to 2016 when working out of Capital Factory in Austin. He was present for all sorts of event such as mentor hours, startup pitches, etc. Funnily enough, he would give you a very stern look if he thought you were taking him for a ride. Have not been there recently as as much as I would like, but I imagine he is still around to be found.</span></p></div></td></tr>

But individual connections to networks grow the pairwise connections by N, so that&#39;s even better.</p><p>broadcast (one to many connections, like giving a speech to a crowd) is an efficiency hack, which is good, and efficiency hacks grow as the number of connections grow, so that&#39;s good too...</p><p>... is more how I think about what Metcalfe was talking about. Which aspects are x, which are x squared, which are log x is interesting, but that&#39;s not all bound up in his simple statment, despite his &#34;as the square&#34; wording.</p><p>and Bob Metcalfe is personally a great guy in all the ways people are saying, but it&#39;s not soooo unique, that&#39;s the way a lot of tech types were as the mantle passed from the Greatest Generation to the Boomers (and what was that one in the middle, &#34;lost&#34; or &#34;invisible&#34; or something) I&#39;m not suggesting we&#39;ve lost that (we may have) just saying that&#39;s how it was, for instance as an undergrad you could walk into any professor&#39;s office and get serious attention.

That&#39;s three.  Additionally another version of the same paper Bob Briscoe contributed data from British Telecom usage that supported the same scaling rule.</p><p>The second paper that you gave is interesting.  Odlyzko was the one who contributed that particular argument.  It is right that there are rational reasons to not interconnect.  But Metcalfe would imply more of a first mover advantage than we actually see.  In social networks we had Friendster, MySpace and Facebook, each of which overtook the other.  How could a new entrant supplant the king?  Not once, but twice?</p><p>Since then new social networks have continued to sprout and succeed.  Facebook managed to stay on top, in part through purchasing other networks.  One of which (Instagram) is on track to surpass Facebook in revenue.</p><p>Now let&#39;s look at the 4 papers that you collected.</p><p>The first and third have the same flaw. They are looking at revenue over time as the network grew.  But the growth of the network is not the only change that happened over time.</p><p>1. The Facebook product improved to become more compelling, even for the same users.  In part by adding new channels through purchasing other networks.</p><p>2. Facebook kept adding new ways to monetize people, improving revenue.</p><p>3. People&#39;s behavior has shifted to more online over time.  Thus it was easier to get value from the same users in 2014 than in 2008.</p><p>Because so much has changed, comparing users in 2008 to users in 2014 is not apples to apples.</p><p>Next, let&#39;s turn to the last paper.  I&#39;m in agreement with patio11 that Bitcoin&#39;s valuation has been driven by the largest Ponzi scheme in history.  Therefore I view most of its valuation as fake.  And so am not inclined to accept arguments from that valuation as valid.</p><p>And I saved the best for last.  In section 2.4 the EU paper argues that Briscoe&#39;s law (I think Odlyzko should be credited, but Bob Briscoe is in the EU) is more accurate than Metcalfe&#39;s law after you hit scale.</p><p>Their argument in effect is a variant of one that was discussed privately before we wrote our paper.  Our immediate perception of the size of a network is based on how much of our personal social groups are on it.  The value we get from that network is based on the same.  Therefore our perception of the size of the network is correlated with the value we get from it.  If the network mostly contains parts of groups, you do get something like Metcalfe&#39;s Law out of this.  But once the network contains a lot of completed social groups, members of those groups slow down how much value they gain as the network continues to grow.</p><p>In other words when the connections in the network are a random sampling of the connections that matter to us, growing the network adds valuable connections.  Once the network contains the connections that we know matters to us, most of us only benefit marginally from continued growth.

                  <p><span>It&#39;s worth mentioning Moore&#39;s Law, which was actually a short term prediction, arguably turned into a business goal. The &#34;law&#34; states that the number of transistors in integrated circuits (like CPUs) will be doubled every two years (or 18 months by some variations). It wasn&#39;t entirely made up, as it was mostly based on advances in manufacturing technology, but it was a prediction made in 1965 that was supposed to hold for ten years. However reality kept up with this prediction for far longer than anticipated until the physical limits of silicon miniaturization became apparent in recent (ish) years, until the mid 00&#39;s (maybe later?).</span></p></div></td></tr>

If decide to measure the &#34;value&#34; of a network based on the number of node connections, then the number of connections for n nodes is n(n-1)/2 = 0.5n^2 - 0.5n which is O(n^2).<p>Of course, the <i>value</i> of something is hard to measure. Typically you measure value as &#34;benefits - costs&#34;, and try to convert everything to a currency. E.g., see: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.asp" rel="nofollow">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-benefitanalysis.as...</a> . But there are often many unknowns, as well as intangible benefits and costs. That make that process - which <i>seems</i> rigorous at first - a lot harder to do in reality.</p><p>So while he may have &#34;made it up&#34; on the spot, he had a deep understanding of networking, and I&#39;m sure he knew that the number of connections is proportional to the square of the number of nodes. So I suspect his intuition grabbed a quick way to estimate value, using what he knew about connection growth. Sure, it&#39;s nowhere near as rigorous as &#34;benefits - costs&#34;, but that is hard to really measure, and many decisions simply need adequate enough information to make a reasonable decision. In which case, he both &#34;made it up&#34; <i>and</i> made a claim that you can justify mathematically.

But, as people at Xerox explained, imagine an entire office full of knowledge workers with their own computers, sending documents and email to each other and to the printer. How much bandwidth would they need? A lot! Someone in Palo Alto had done a whiteboard exercise on the bandwidth required for teleportation, in other words, sending an entire human being through the wire. It wasn’t that they took the prospect of teleportation seriously, but still, it was fun, and she enjoyed being around people who had fun at work.</p><p>Ken scoffed and insisted that Ethernet would never work. This was a recurring argument with them that was starting to annoy her, although usually she’d just smile and change the subject. He kept hurling the word deterministic as if it were a magic talisman. On the Ethernet, you weren’t certain how long you’d have to wait to transmit your data. If the wire was busy when you wanted to talk, you had to wait.</p><p>If someone else tried to transmit exactly when you did, you both had to back off and try again. An engineer could give you the probabilities of various results, but no more. This was not real engineering, and Ken was offended by it. He was even offended by the word “ether” since any beginning physics student knows that ether was a bogus concept that was disproven ages ago.</p><p>The entire communications field that the two of them had studied at MIT was based on strict mathematical calculations and guarantees. For example, when you make a telephone connection, that circuit is yours until you’re done. No other calls interfere with yours. The telephone companies had spent decades perfecting this system, and they had a monopoly. How could any company, even one as big as Xerox, hope to change that?</p><p>She tried telling him that packet-switching was a real discipline, and the Defense Department itself was backing it. It was originally designed to survive a nuclear attack that destroyed some of the military’s communications lines. With packet switching, the message was broken up into pieces, or packets, and the packets might arrive on separate paths. Ken didn’t believe it would ever have commercial applications. People in aerospace had a low opinion of commercial stuff anyway.  1 The original speed goal for the Xerox Wire was 20 megabits/sec. The first controller, for the Dolphin, had independent send and receive buffers, but could only be made to fit on the board using 10-Mbps CRC chips from Fairchild. Furthermore, in the lab, Tony found that 20-Mbps signaling caused spurious collision detects on the cable due to transceiver tap reflections.

This means that it inherits all the complexities of 10GbE, while tolerating cheaper connectors and cables.    
10GbE uses DSQ128 PAM-16 at 800Msym/s. 2.5G just does quarter-rate at 200Msym/s.<p>1000BaseT uses trellis coded PAM-5, a significantly less complex modulation.</p><p>When one factors in the complexity of the line code and all equalisation and other processing in the analog frontend things get expensive.   
Copper 10Gb interfaces run very hot for a reason. It takes quite a bit of signal processing and tricks to push 10Gb over copper, at least for any significant distances.

So far we have assigned ~570 billion addresses via 24/28/36 bit range assignments for the same purpose which represents a little under 1% of the space. So nothing urgent, though if we stuck with Ethernet as much as we use it today then in &lt;100 years I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we were &#34;out&#34;.<p>At the same time there are also 46 bits of locally administered unicast addresses and, unlike IP, Ethernet addresses only care about the local network (and this isn&#39;t a &#34;because we&#39;ve co-opted them to to save space just like NAT broke IP protocols&#34; rather the design intent of Ethernet). Even if you had 10 billion LANs with 100 devices each and they all used this random non-unique assignment there would only be a ~50% chance there one or more devices would have a collision.</p><p>The only real advantage I&#39;ve ever been able to find of programming in unique MAC addresses vs random MAC addresses you can look up what company the MAC was assigned to. It may seem like there is a risk random assignment can be done poorly (e.g. not very randomly) but honestly the same risk exist with assigned ranges as seen by network vendors cheaping out and re-using their MAC blocks (which is significantly more likely to conflict than if they just used random locally administered addresses in the first place).

So there are only 16M blocks of mac addreses available, and it IS possible to run out, if vendors waste the addresses.  I don&#39;t know what registration costs from The IEEE right now, but once the equivalent of $16B is spent on mac addresses, we will run out of blocks.<p>Maybe today they are selling smaller blocks but the MAC is basically divided into 16M blocks (specified by the first 24 bits / 3 bytes) - each with a registered owner or &#34;unassigned&#34;) and 16M MACs within the block (the lower 24 bits).  That&#39;s why you can enter a MAC address into a lookup website and find out who made the NIC (google search &#34;mac address lookup&#34;):</p><p><a href="https://aruljohn.com/mac.pl" rel="nofollow">https://aruljohn.com/mac.pl</a>

This was a better scaling tradeoff. 1x $$$ network device + 100x $ client adapter vs 1x $$ networking device + 100x $$ client adapter.</p><p>- Because of the above, you started to get <i>really</i> cost- and data-efficient networks when the cost of Ethernet switches plummeted.

They have to learn what MAC addresses are behind each port, and build a complex forwarding table and do table lookups in real time.  The larger the switch, the more complex it is.  Its hard to make it scale.<p>Around the same era, Myrinet switches with higher bandwidth (1.2Gb/s if I remember correctly) and higher density at a fraction of the port cost of slower ethernet switches.  This was possible because the Myrinet switches were dumb.. The Myrinet network elected a &#34;mapper&#34; that distributed routes to all NICs.  The NICs then pre-pended routing flits to the front of each packet.  So to forward a packet to its destination, all a Myrinet switch had to do was strip off and then read the first flit, see that it said &#34;exit this hop on port 7&#34;, and then forward it on to the next switch.  Higher densities were achieved with multiple chips inside the cabinet.</p><p>In the mid 2000s we even built one of what was, at the time, one of the worlds largest ethernet switches using (newer, faster Myrinet) internally, and encapsulating the ethernet traffic inside Myrinet.  That product died due to pressure from folks that were our partners, but felt threatened by our incredibly inexpensive high density switches.</p><p><a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/2323306/myricom-rolls-out-switch-for-large-clusters.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.networkworld.com/article/2323306/myricom-rolls-o...</a></p><p>EDIT: fixed routing flit description, added link to PR

It was the bare minimum to do the job, 6-byte station destination, 6-byte source address, 2-byte packet length, a 2-byte Ethertype field (the latter 2 were combined for networks with hardware framing), and 32-bit CRC.  NO arc in the hardware. It leveraged the move to byte-based memories and small CPUs.  It followed the end-to-end principle in system design just about optimally - the most minimal MAC design of all time. EASY TO BUILD UPON AND ENHANCE.<p>Ethernet (CSMA/CD) is a protocol that copies human speech patterns.  After someone stops speaking people hear the quiet (carrier sense multiple access / CSMA) and wait a very short and randomized amount of time and begin to speak.  If two speakers collide they hear the collision and shut up (CD - collision detection).  They both pick a randomized amount of time to pause before trying again.  On the second third etc. collision people wait longer and longer before retrying.</p><p>The thing about original ethernet (1981) is that it wastes 2/3 of the channel because a highly loaded channel has too many collisions and too many back offs.  But deployment and wiring were expensive so running a single wire throughout a building was the cheapest possible way to start (enhanced by thinwire Ethernet and twisted pair to have a less bulky cable a few years later).  The frame design was PERFECT and within ~10 years people were using ethernet frames to build switched networks and today only radio networks are CSMA/CD = Ethernet.

<p>What do you see? What can you build?</p>




<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/magazine_cover.png" alt="The Magazine, a transparent png"/>
</p> 

<h2 id="amagazine">A magazine</h2>

<p>When I first saw <em>The Magazine</em> I smiled. </p>

<p>I smiled because it was so sensible, so rational, and so immediately obvious.</p>

<p>It felt like a platonic mobile-publishing container. No cruft, all substance. A shadow on the wall. The kind of app that&#39;s doing nothing fancy but everything right. The kind of app deemed anathema by Future Publishing Authorities because, quite frankly, it’s boring. </p>

<p>We feel like we&#39;ve seen this before, but — have we?</p>

<p>In a conversation with renowned Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen about the newspaper industry, Joshua Benton remarked, <em>“The perception of the incoming disruptors is that they are low quality, and therefore not really worth paying attention to.”</em><sup id="fn-1"><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Let’s pay attention. </p>




<h2 id="carsamppublishing">Cars &amp; publishing</h2>

<p>In 1967 Honda unveiled the <span>N360</span>. </p>

<p>The <span>N360</span> was a <em>kei</em>, or <em>light</em> style car; a subcompact. </p>

<figure><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/honda-n360-color.jpg"/>
<figcaption>Honda N360 — a sexy little beast — via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kemeko/6971312560/in/photostream/">kemeko1971</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I like to imagine the engineers at Honda huddled together, dumping the sum total of all car design and production technology on our worn, wooden table. Around they gathered and together they asked, <em>“What&#39;s the simplest thing we can build with this?”</em> </p>

<p>With that question in mind, Honda — who had only been making motorcycles since 1949, and cars since 1963 — took one of their motorcycle engines and placed it in a Mini Cooper inspired body. It had 31 horse power. It was reliable. It was affordable. It got <em>39.4 miles to the gallon</em>.<sup id="fn-2"><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <span>N360</span> was something an American car company would never dream of producing. You can’t blame them though: they had no incentive by which to dream such dreams. Unlike the American automotive industry, the Japanese automotive industry wasn&#39;t beholden to industry momentum or legacy. And when you’re not beholden to legacy, you can be excessively brazen.</p>

<p>In the software industry we talk about <span>MVP</span>s, or Minimum Viable Products. The <span>N360</span> was a Minimum Viable Car. </p>

<p>The <span>N360</span> didn’t make it to the States, but the followup — and near equally cute — <span>N600</span> did. Next came the Honda Civic, then soon after, the oil crisis. We all know how the story goes from there. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They started with cheap subcompacts that were widely considered a joke. Now they make Lexuses that challenge the best of what Europe can offer.”<sup id="fn-3"><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup>
    <cite>— Christensen, Skok, Allworth</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honda was a nobody in the car industry. But they gained foothold and marketshare by building a car that was more appropriate for many consumers. They had built a subcompact. </p>

<p>So I ask: <em>where are our digital publishing subcompacts?</em></p>



<h2 id="currentofferings">Current offerings</h2>

<p>There is an intuitive usability implicit to the physicality of our printed books and magazines. A reader is given two possible directions — which one depends on language and culture. And from there, a mostly linear, usually <em>obvious</em> interface.<sup id="fn-4"><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Tablet and smartphone books and magazines are not so obvious. They’re so not obvious that we often need tutorials explaining just how to use them. </p>

<p>Why did we jump to such complex interfaces? </p>



<h3 id="homer">Homer</h3>

<p>Perhaps we <em>Homer’d</em>. </p>

<p>When Homer Simpson was asked to design his ideal car, he made <em>The Homer</em>. Given free reign, Homer’s process was additive. He added three horns and a special sound-proof bubble for the children. He layered <em>more</em> atop everything cars had been. More horns, more cup holders. </p>

<figure><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/thehomer.jpg" alt="The Homer" title="The Homer"/><figcaption>The Homer</figcaption></figure>

<p>In product design, the simplest thought exercise is to make additions. It’s the easiest way to make an Old Thing feel like a New Thing. The more difficult exercise is to reconsider the product in the context of <em>now</em>. A now which may be very different from the <em>then</em> in which the product was originally conceived. </p>


<h2 id="ournow">Our now</h2>

<p>Publishing incumbents have been faced with disruption for years. But a curious, natural thing is happening: another, increasingly difficult to dismiss publishing ecosystem — disconnected from and unbeholden to legacy — is emerging. Bubbling up.<sup id="fn-5"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>A few years back, ‘publishing’ startups<sup id="fn-6"><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a></sup> were usually launched by <em>one</em> of two types of individuals: </p>

<ol>
<li>Technologists disconnected from traditional content ecosystems</li>

<li>Incumbents of traditional content ecosystems disconnected from technologists</li>
</ol>

<p>What publishing startups really needed during that narrow window of time was both: Technologists who got infrastructure and product, coupled with the stewards of the content of the incumbents. What they needed — and often lacked — was a mutual empathy. </p>

<p>Now, it’s not so clear. The content of the incumbents becomes less important as <em>new</em> content creators emerge. And emerging they are. <sup id="fn-7"><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With history as our guide, it shouldn’t be a surprise when new entrants like The Huffington Post and BuzzFeed, which began life as news aggregators, begin their march up the value network. They may have started by collecting cute pictures of cats but they are now expanding into politics, transforming from aggregators into generators of original content, and even, in the case of The Huffington Post, winning a Pulitzer Prize for its reporting. 
  <cite>— Christensen, Skok &amp; Allworth</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can look to even more recent examples to see an evolution of this trend.</p>


<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/matter_logo.png" alt="MATTER logo"/>
</p>
<h3 id="matter">Matter</h3>

<p>Launched on November 14, 2012, Bobbie Johnson and Jim Giles’ new publication <span>MATTER</span> may be indicative of the quality of publishers to arrive in this emergent space. In March, 2012, they raised $140,000 from 2,500 supporters on Kickstarter — the equivalent of an angel round of investing for a technology startup.<sup id="fn-8"><a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>With those funds they built their website, commissioned writers and photographers, and have set out to explore the somewhat uncharted intersection of paid content and high-quality journalism. </p>

<p>In their words: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span>MATTER</span> isn’t quite a website, it’s not really a magazine and it’s not exactly a book publisher either. Instead, <span>MATTER</span> is something else — a new model for high-quality journalism, an area that’s been hit hard by the transition from print to digital media. We think that our focus on selling individual long-form stories for consumption on any device, whether it’s your computer, phone, e-reader or tablet, could be a sustainable way of paying for the hard work required to produce the best reporting.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a great invocation: <em>not quite website, not quite magazine, not quite book.</em> It sums up well the liminal space in which we play as digital publishers.</p>

<p>The first article they published was 7,826 words. You can read a preview or buy it for $0.99. Buying the article gets you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distraction free web edition</li>

<li>eBook for Kindle, iPad or other readers</li>

<li>Invite to a Q&amp;A with the author</li>
</ul>

<p>They also sell memberships — which includes a seat on their editorial board. </p>

<p><span>MATTER</span> is building their most valuable asset: community. They&#39;re <em>hungry</em> and <em>talented</em>. And they&#39;re the tip of an iceberg.</p>

<p><em>Not quite website, not quite magazine, not quite book.</em> Whatever they may be, we’re poised to see more like them — soon. </p>


<p><span id="sub_skeuomorphic">
<h2 id="skeuomorphicbusinessmodels">Skeuomorphic business models</h2>

<p>Skeuomorphism is traditionally attached to design decisions. We bring the mechanical camera shutter sound to digital cameras because it feels good. We render paper page flips in our digital reading applications because it’s familiar. </p>

<p>But skeuomorphism also cuts into business models. </p>

<p>A publisher like <span>MATTER</span> brings the best of the old — an understanding of editorial ethics, storytelling, craft — and changes the shape of the content and distribution models of the content to match digital. This isn’t always the case.</p>

<p>Business skeuomorphism happens when we take business decisions explicitly tied to one medium, and bring them to another medium — no questions asked. Business skeuomorphism is rampant in the publishing industry. The simplest example is with magazines. </p>

<p>Just look at the covers in Newsstand: </p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/newsstand_whatthe.jpg" title="Newsstand"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/newsstand_whatthe.jpg" alt="Apple Newsstand screenshot"/></a><figcaption>Digital Magazine ‘Covers’</figcaption></figure>

<p>Not a single cover is readable. This may <em>seem</em> like design skeuomorphism, but it’s not. No designer looked at those covers in Newsstand and said: <em>&#34;Perfect! Ship it!&#34;</em> It’s driven by business decisions and legacy-facing infrastructure.<sup id="fn-9"><a href="#ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>

<p>The farther out we zoom, the clearer this becomes. A generalized print magazine may be composed of the following qualities: </p>

<ul>
<li>Each issue contains a dozen or more articles. </li>

<li>Issues operate on a monthly cycle. </li>

<li>All articles are bundled and shipped at the same time. </li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all of these qualities are the result of responses to distribution and production constraints. Printing and binding takes a certain amount of time. Shipping the issues takes another chunk of time. In order to find a balance between timeliness of content and shelf-life, a month makes a pretty sensible — if brisk — publishing schedule. </p>

<h3 id="oldintonew">Old into new</h3>

<p>So why do so many of our digital magazines publish on the same schedule, with the same number of articles as their print counterparts? Using the same covers? Of course, they do because it’s easier to maintain identical schedules across mediums. To not design twice. To not test twice (or, at all). </p>

<p>Unfortunately — from a medium-specific user experience point of view — it’s almost impossible to produce a digitally indigenous magazine beholden to those legacy constraints. Why? Not least because we use tablets and smartphones very differently than we use printed publications. </p>

<p>One of the great benefits of being part of the emergent publishing world is that you don’t have multiple mediums to publish across.<sup id="fn-10"><a href="#ref-10">[10]</a></sup> You can and probably should focus squarely on digital. Perhaps later — contingent on market demand and content quality — you can consider publishing a print anthology to give your publication a stronger literal edge.<sup id="fn-11"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup> </p>

<p>So what are these so called <em>‘indigenous’</em> qualities of digital?</p>



<span id="sub_manifesto">
<h2 id="asubcompactmanifesto">A Subcompact Manifesto</h2>

<p>Subcompact Publishing tools are first and foremost straightforward.</p>

<p>They require few to no instructions. </p>

<p>They are easily understood on first blush.</p>

<p>The editorial and design decisions around them react to digital as a distribution and consumption space. </p>

<p>They are the result of dumping our publishing related technology on a table and asking ourselves — what are the core tools we can build with all this stuff?</p>

<p>They are, as it were, little <span>N360</span>s.</p>

<p>I propose <em>Subcompact Publishing</em> tools and editorial ethos begin <em>(but not end)</em> with the following qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small issue sizes (3-7 articles / issue)</li>

<li>Small file sizes</li>

<li>Digital-aware subscription prices</li>

<li>Fluid publishing schedule</li>

<li>Scroll (don’t paginate)</li>

<li>Clear navigation</li>

<li><span>HTML</span>(ish) based</li>

<li>Touching the open web</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these qualities play off one another. Let’s look at them in detail.</p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-pieces.png" alt="Small issues"/>
</p>

<h3 id="smallissuesizes">Small issue sizes</h3>

<p>I’ve written <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/unbinding/">quite a bit</a> about creating a sense of ‘edge’ in digital space. One of the easiest and most intuitive ways to do so is to limit the amount of data you present to the user.<sup id="fn-12"><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s much more difficult for someone to intuit the breadth of a digital magazine containing twenty articles than a digital magazine containing, for example, five. By keeping article number low this also helps decrease file size and simplify navigation.</p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-size.png" alt="small file size"/>
</p>

<h3 id="smallfilesize">Small file size</h3>

<p>Speed is grossly undervalued in much of today’s software — digital magazines inclusive. Speed <em>(and with it a fluid and joyful user experience)</em> should be the thing you absolutely optimize for once you have a minimum viable product.</p>

<p>One way to bake speed into a publishing product is to keep issue file sizes as small as possible. This happens naturally when you limit the number of articles per issue. </p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-price.png" alt="reasonable subscription price"/>
</p>

<h3 id="reasonablesubscriptionprices">Reasonable subscription prices</h3>

<p>Ideally, digital subscription prices should reflect the cost of doing business as a digitally indigenous product, not the cost of protecting print subscriptions. This is yet another advantage digital-first publications have — unlike print publications transitioning to digital, there is no legacy infrastructure to subsidize during this transition.</p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-schedule.png" alt="fluid publishing schedule"/>
</p>

<h3 id="fluidpublishingschedule">Fluid publishing schedule</h3>

<p>With smaller issue sizes comes more fluid publishing schedules. Again, to create a strong sense of edge and understanding, the goal isn’t to publish ten articles a day, but rather to publish just a few high-quality articles with a predictable looseness. Depending on the type of content you’re publishing, days can feel too granular, and months require the payload to be too large. Weeks feel just about right in digital.</p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-scroll.png" alt="scroll"/>
</p>

<h3 id="scrollfornow">Scroll (for now)</h3>

<p>When I originally presented these ideas at the Books in Browsers conference in 2012, the dismissal of pagination was by far the most contentious point. I don’t mean to imply all pagination is bad. Remember — we’re outlining the very <em>core</em> of Subcompact Publishing. Anything extraneous or overly complex should be excised. </p>

<p>I’ve spent the last two and half years deconstructing scrolling and pagination on tablets and smartphones. If your content is formless, then you might be able to paginate with minimal effort. Although, probably not. </p>

<p>Certain kinds of pagination increase the complexity of an application by orders of magnitude. The engineering efforts required to produce beautiful, simple, indigenous, consistent — and <em>fast</em> — pagination are simply too high to belong in the subcompact space.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when you remove pagination, you vastly simplify navigation and thereby simplify users’ mental models around content. </p>

<p>No pagination is vastly superior to pagination done poorly. </p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-nav.png" alt="clear navigation"/>
</p>
<h3 id="clearnavigation">Clear navigation</h3>

<p>Navigation should be consistent and effortless. Subcompact Publishing applications don’t require complex how-to pages or tutorials. You shouldn’t have to hire a famous actor to show readers how to use the app with his nose. Much like a printed magazine or book, the interaction should be intuitive, effortless, and grounding. The user should never feel lost. </p>

<p>By limiting the number of articles per issue, and by removing pagination, many of the routes leading to complex navigation are also removed. </p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-html5.png" alt="HTML"/>
</p>

<h3 id="htmlishbased">HTML(ish) based</h3>

<p>When I say <span>HTML</span> I also mean <span>epub</span> or <spanc>mobi</spanc> or any other format with an <span>HTML</span> pedigree. <span>HTML</span> has indisputably emerged as the future format for all text <em>(and perhaps also interactive)</em> content. By constraining Subcompact Publishing systems to <span>HTML</span> we bake portability and future-proofness into the platforms. We also minimize engineering efforts because most all computing devices come with high-quality <span>HTML</span> rendering engines built in. </p>

<p><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/subcompact-open.png" alt="open web"/>
</p>

<h3 id="openweb">Open web</h3>

<p>Simply: whatever content is published on a tablet should have a corresponding, touchable home on the open web. </p>

<p>Content without a public address is non-existent in the eyes of all the inter-operable sharing mechanisms that together bind the web.</p>


<span id="sub_jobs">
<h2 id="publishingjobstobedone">Publishing jobs to be done</h2>

<p>Clayton Christensen — author of <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em> — likes to look at the relationship between consumers and products from the perspective of the <em>jobs-to-be-done</em> theory.<sup id="fn-13"><a href="#ref-13">[13]</a></sup> In his words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic idea is that people don’t go around looking for products to buy. Instead, they take life as it comes and when they encounter a problem, they look for a solution—and at that point, they’ll hire a product or service.</p>
  
  <p>The key insight from thinking about your business this way is that it is the job, and not the customer or the product, that should be the fundamental unit of analysis. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his recent <em>Nieman Reports</em> piece on disruption in the news industry, Christensen uses the contemporary example of “I’m waiting in line for coffee and have ten minutes to kill.” The person with the problem hires their smartphone to entertain or educate them for those ten minutes. </p>

<h3 id="morecontemporaryjobs">More contemporary jobs</h3>

<p>Within the scope of contemporary digital publishing are many, many, many yet-to-be-satisfied jobs-to-be-done. One that has irked me for years is the lack of a great solution to ‘subscribe,’ for money, to a website or author or publisher. When I find a new writer with whom I’m enamored, there’s usually no effortless or indigenous way to pay for their content. </p>

<p><span>RSS</span> may be fine for a backend protocol and packet structure, but from a ‘normal’ consumer facing point of view, <span>RSS</span> has never made sense. (It’s sort of like <code>git</code> without <code>github</code>.) In effect, creating a better kind of <em>consumer facing</em> <span>RSS</span> is to solve the above problem. </p>

<p>Connected with this generalized notion of subscription is that the output to which you’re subscribed should be quick, lightweight, predictable, reliable and cached locally. If you hire an author or publication to solve a problem, you may partially be paying for the content, but you’ll really be paying for a great reading solution with those attributes. It just happens to have their content. </p>



<span id="sub_outline">

<h2 id="outliningasystem">Outlining a system</h2>

<p>To begin, let’s sketch out the world’s simplest desktop editorial system.   </p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/pubsystem01.png" title="Our simple editorial system"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/pubsystem01.png" alt="A wireframe of a simple editorial system"/></a><figcaption>Our simple editorial system</figcaption></figure>

<p>Our system has three columns: <em>Issues</em>, <em>Articles</em>, and <em>Article Text</em>. You click an issue, it shows you the articles. You click an article, you see the article text. There’s a button that says <code>Publish.</code> That’s it. </p>

<p>So where does it publish to? </p>

<h3 id="theopenweb">The open web</h3>

<p>For most content — in most contexts — a publisher will only <em>benefit</em> from giving their content a publicly referable address. So the first obvious place to publish to is the open web. </p>

<p>Easy. We’ve done that for nearly two decades now and have oodles of mature tools to handle open web publishing. </p>

<p>On the open web, optimize first for reading and second for one or two calls to action: an app download or an email subscription. But whatever you do, <em>don’t</em> undermine the reading experience. To undermine open web reading is to undermine open web sharing <em>(no one wants to share something that’s hard to read)</em> — and that’s the whole point of having our content out there. </p>

<h3 id="tabletsandsmartphones">Tablets and smartphones</h3>

<p>Desktop — the open web — is easy. Tablets and smartphones are still hard. </p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/pubsystem02.png" title="Pushing to tabletos"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/pubsystem02.png" alt="Publishing to tablets?"/></a><figcaption>Publishing to the web is easy, effortlessly publishing to tablets is unpossible</figcaption></figure>

<p>Tablets and smartphones are used differently than desktops and laptops. They’re frequently without an internet connection. Smartphone users ‘snack’ and want content quickly. The open web isn’t always the fastest way to get content: it (usually) doesn’t cache content, and it’s not accessible without an internet connection.</p>

<p>To simplify the tablet equation, let’s assume we’re only interested in publishing to iOS devices. If only someone had built a delivery mechanism to push content from our editorial system to readers seamlessly and in the background … </p>

<h3 id="newsstand">Newsstand</h3>

<p>Ah! But someone did — Apple: Newsstand.</p>

<p>Apple’s Newsstand? <em>&#34;But isn’t that where all those horrible things live?&#34;</em> I hear you say. Or, <em>&#34;Oh? That folder I’ve never opened?&#34;</em> </p>

<p>Newsstand is perhaps the most underutilized, under-imagined distribution tool in the short history of tablet publishing. If you squint your eyes and tilt your head at just the right angle, you’ll notice something magical about Newsstand: given the proper container, it’s a background downloading, offline-friendly, cached <span>RSS</span> machine people can subscribe to. <em>For money.</em></p>

<p>It handily solves our <em>job-to-be-done</em>. </p>



<span id="sub_themagazine">
<h2 id="themagazine">The Magazine</h2>

<p>Which brings us back to <em>The Magazine</em>. </p>

<p>In the words of Marco Arment, creator of the magazine: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t consider The Magazine to be a member of “the magazine industry” any more than blogs are members of “the publishing industry”. Those terms evoke the old and established, while this is the new and experimental.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many iPad magazines are carrying unnecessary and expensive baggage from their print days. Some born-digital magazines even took on print baggage simply because they thought they needed it.<sup id="fn-14"><a href="#ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In one gesture Marco set loose an <span>N360</span>. He’s designed and programmed one of the first truly tablet-indigenous subcompact publications. </p>

<ul>
<li>Each issue contains only four or five articles.</li>

<li>Each issue is less than a few megabytes, meaning they download in seconds, rather than minutes or hours like many other digital magazines. </li>

<li>The subscription price is $1.99 a month. </li>

<li>Subscribing is seamlessly baked into the platform via Newsstand.</li>

<li>It’s published twice a month.</li>

<li>It’s an unpaginated application.</li>

<li>The navigation is consistent and completely intuitive. </li>

<li>It’s <span>HTML</span> based. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="uiandux">UI and UX</h3>

<p>There is almost nothing to the app. On the main reading screen you have three options:</p>

<div>
<div>
  <figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine01.png" title="The main interface"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine01.png" alt="The Magazine&#39;s main interface"/></a><figcaption>The main magazine</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<div>

<ul>
<li>Swipe up or down to scroll and read the current article</li>
<li>Tap the top right button to share the current article</li>
<li>Tap the hamburger button<sup>(Fig. 1)</sup> to slide in the Table of Contents</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. You can’t do anything else. </p>

<p>There’s even less UI when you dig deeper: the share button will be rarely used, and the hamburger button is superfluous; the Table of Contents can be invoked at any time by swiping from left to right across the page. </p></div>
</div>

<p><em>The Magazine</em> doesn’t need a how-to, an instructions page, or a fancy video. This app mimics the intuitive usability of a printed publication as well as anything else we’ve seen.</p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/hamburger.jpg" title="The hamburger button"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/hamburger.jpg" alt="The Hamburger Button" title="The Hamburger Button"/></a><figcaption>Fig. 1: The Hamburger button</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>

<p>By keeping issue size small, <em>The Magazine</em> mitigates Table of Contents complexity. There’s no need to ‘zoom out’ or show a macro  view of the length of each article. When there’s only four or five articles per issue, the user intuitively senses the edges. Navigation need not be more than a simple list.</p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-toc.png" title="Table of contents"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-toc.png" alt="Table of contents as a simple list"/></a><figcaption>The simple, intuitive, edgeful table of contents</figcaption></figure>

<p>Swipe to delete an issue and it collapses down to a neat row. Tap a deleted issue and it downloads again in seconds. </p>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p><em>The Magazine</em> also smartly handles links. Tap a link and you’re shown an annotated version of that link at the bottom of the screen <em>(or in a pop-over on the iPad)</em>. Effectively, they’re footnotes. The author summarizes the link’s content and if you <em>then</em> wish to visit the <span>URL</span>, you can, by tapping again. </p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-links.png" title="Footnotes"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-links.png" alt="Footnotes in The Magazine"/></a><figcaption>Links / Footnote UI</figcaption></figure>

<p>The result is a very <em>solid</em> reading environment. There are no accidental buttons to press. There’s no confusion as to where you are. There’s really only two places to be in <em>The Magazine</em>: reading an article or scrolling through the always succinct ToC. </p>

<h3 id="newsstand">Newsstand</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most magical part of the entire experience is <em>The Magazine’s</em> integration with Apple’s Newsstand. Newsstand provides two critical functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Background downloading of content</li>

<li>Paid subscription conversions</li>
</ul>

<p>Newsstand is the only place in iOS that allows 3rd party applications to download content in the background. What this means is that new articles are available almost immediately after Marco hits publish <em>(or whatever his button says)</em> in <em>The Magazine’s</em> backend. Which means as a reader you don’t have to preemptively load content before getting on an airplane or subway. If there’s new content, it will be waiting and cached for your offline pleasure. </p>

<p>Newsstand also mitigates all complexity and trust issues connected with payments — you’re paying Apple, not Marco. The infrastructure allows you to give readers a free starter subscription, and then later — seamlessly — convert them into a recurring, monthly, payments. </p>

<h3 id="openweb">Open web</h3>

<p>And finally — unsurprisingly — <em>The Magazine</em> also nails the web.</p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-web.png" title="The open web"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-web.png" alt="The Magazine on the open web"/></a><figcaption>The Magazine on the web</figcaption></figure>

<p>the-magazine.org is minimal and optimized for two actions: reading and converting to a <em>The Magazine</em> download. </p>

<p>Presently, the full text of the articles isn’t online. I would love to see an <span>A/B</span> test around full / truncated content conversion. My gut tells me that app downloads / subscription conversions wouldn’t change by switching to full content. But sharing <em>would</em> increase dramatically. </p>

<p>Users are much more likely to share a link to the full-text of an article than a truncated version. Increased sharing means more eyeballs, and more eyeballs — if conversion rates remain static — means more downloads and subscriptions. </p>

<p>Keep in mind Christensen’s jobs-to-be-done — users are probably more excited about paying for the cached, simple, svelte, <em>eminently hirable</em> reading experience <em>The Magazine</em> provides, than simply getting to the full version of any single article. </p>

<figure><a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-all.png" title="Subcompact publishing in seven screens"><img src="https://craigmod.com/journal/images/subcompact_publishing/themagazine-all.png" alt="Subcompact publishing in seven screens"/></a><figcaption>The Magazine: a subcompact publication in seven screen shots</figcaption></figure>

<p>In just a handful of screens, <em>The Magazine</em> cleanly answers the question posed above in our subcompact editorial system: <em>where does your content go when you hit Publish?</em> </p>






<span id="sub_clarity">
<h2 id="clarity">Clarity</h2>

<p>The clarity of <em>The Magazine</em> is exciting. It’s doubly exciting because it’s precisely the sort of app at which incumbent publishers balk. This is expected. Again, from Christensen: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are the new customers: The new readers, the new writers, the new publishers. <em>The Magazine</em> is indeed <em>cheaper, simpler, smaller, and more convenient</em> than most other publishing apps. </p>

<p>It doesn’t take much imagination to connect a minimal container like <em>The Magazine</em> with the deeper investigative editorial ethos of <span><em>MATTER</em></span> and get even more excited.</p>

<p>So why doesn’t a publication like <span><em>MATTER</em></span> just publish to Newsstand? Because the tallest hurdle before Newsstand is that you have to <em>program an iOS application</em> to use it. A cost prohibitively expensive endeavor for many publishers. And, complicating matters, publishers usually aren’t good at producing software.</p>

<p>The fact that Marco — a programmer — launched one of the most ‘digitally indigenous’ contemporary tablet publications is indicative of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Programmers are today’s magicians. In many industries this is obvious, but it’s now becoming more obvious in publishing. Marco was able to make <em>The Magazine</em> happen quickly because he saw that Newsstand was underutilized and understood its capabilities. He knew this because he’s a programmer. Newsstand wasn’t announced at a publishing conference. It was announced at the <span>WWDC</span>. </li>

<li>The publishing ecosystem is now <em>primed</em> for complete disruption.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Paul Graham’s essay <em>Startup Ideas</em><sup id="fn-15"><a href="#ref-15">[15]</a></sup> he talks about the kind of programmer Marco is: the self-motivated producer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you’ll be able to implement them. That’s not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn’t) but it’s an advantage. It’s a big advantage, when you&#39;re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking “That&#39;s an interesting idea,” you can think instead “That’s an interesting idea. I’ll try building an initial version tonight.” It’s even better when you’re both a programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco is not just a publishing-interested engineer, he’s a <em>subcompact publishing magnate</em>. He lives happily outside of anything resembling the incumbent big-P infrastructure. And from this removed stance he produces podcasts, a magazine, a reading application, and curated reading lists … all using simple tools wrapped in minimal containers. </p>

<p>You need technological awareness to be a future publishing disruptor; even if you don’t see yourself as such.</p>

<h3 id="distruptationalisticly">Distruptationalisticly</h3>

<p>We’re on the precipice of a wave of tools and systems that have nothing to do with incumbents and everything to do with the bubbling new wave.</p>

<p>To quote again from Paul Graham’s essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players ignore. It’s particularly good if there’s an admixture of disdain in the big players’ attitude, because that often misleads them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The winter of 2012 will be the first holiday season where a broad swath of consumers will have both an awareness of tablets, and several <em>good enough</em> options to choose from <em>(occupying multiple price points)</em>. If 2013 doesn’t prove to be an inflection year for digital publishing — and particularly for the non-incumbents — then I don’t know what market circumstances would be necessary to make it so.</p>

<p>Our current tools are a bit kludgey, a bit clunky, a bit too tied to the past. <em>The Magazine</em> is a great first example of a subcompact publication, utilizing Newsstand — an <em>existing</em> under-leveraged tool — to indigenously and ingenuously deliver content. </p>

<p>I’d be shocked if there weren’t a dozen other publishers prepping to launch similar magazines. Or, even better: someone building a system by which anyone could launch a Newsstand app like <em>The Magazine</em> — for minimal cost with minimal complexity.</p>

<p>It’s easy to dismiss.<br/> 
There’s lots of disdain.<br/> 
Why not be part of the group that shakes it up?</p>

<p>Take all of our digital publishing nuts and springs, bits and bolts and spread them out on the old table. Climb our ladder and look down and ask yourself:<br/> <em>“What can I build for subcompact publishing?”</em></p>

<h3 id="followupreadinginspirationandthanks">Followup reading, inspiration and thanks</h3>

<p>This essay — the entire concept of <em>Subcompact Publishing</em> — was obviously hugely inspired by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clayton Christensen, David Skok, and James Allworth’s <a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102798/Breaking-News.aspx">Mastering the art of disruptive innovation in journalism</a> in the Fall 2012 issue of <em>Nieman Reports</em>. If <em>any</em> of the above interests you, I can’t recommend more highly going and reading that report. </li>

<li>Marco’s <em>The Magazine</em> — an app that helped crystalize a lot of my thinking around these topics. </li>
</ul>

<p>Christensen did a <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/clay-christensen-on-the-news-industry-we-didnt-quite-understand-how-quickly-things-fall-off-the-cliff/">supplementary interview</a> to the <em>Report</em> piece which is also worth your time. Somewhat related, but also unrelated, he has a wonderful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvos4nORf_Y">TEDx talk</a> on measuring your life. If, like me, you’re not particularly religious, just replace the word &#34;god&#34; with &#34;Google&#34; in your head, and suddenly it makes a lot of sense. <em>(&#34;Google will judge you when you’re gone.&#34; — oh, yes, yes Google will!)</em></p>

<p>There’s a bunch of links in the <em>Noted</em> section below on the <span>N360</span> which really is a neat little car. I’ve become more than slightly obsessed with finding one to take for a drive. </p>

<p>Thank you to all these people (known and unknown — I’m looking at you, unsung post-war Honda engineers) for making these wonderful things.</p>
