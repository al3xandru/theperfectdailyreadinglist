    <blockquote>If you ask StackOverflow or ChatGPT, how to convert an InputStream to a String in Java, you get archaic constructs with buffered readers and tedious loops. In modern Java, you achieve this task and similar ones with a single line of code. Apparently, these one-liners are not common knowledge, so I list a few. Maybe it&#39;ll get me a mention in the the JetBrains Java Annotated Monthly newsletter.</blockquote>
    <p>JetBrains has a <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/java-annotated/">nice monthly newsletter</a> with Java tidbits. Mostly, these links are really useful. But the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2023/04/java-annotated-monthly-april-2023/">April 2023</a> edition included <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/a-complete-guide-on-how-to-convert-inputstream-to">A Complete Guide on How to Convert InputStream to String In Java</a> with the caption: “Eden Allen gives step-by-step instructions on understanding Inputstream [sic] and converting it to String using BufferedReader.”</p>
    <p><img src="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2023-04-09/ThoroughlyModernMillie.jpg" alt=".jpg" loading="lazy"/></p>
    <p>Huh? Why do you need to use <code>BufferedReader</code> for this in 2023? And why is the <a href="https://dzone.com/users/4811023/edenallen.html">author&#39;s web page</a> listed as <a href="https://cheapsslweb.com">https://cheapsslweb.com</a>? Maybe ChatGPT had a hand in this? When I asked OpenAI Chat “How to Convert InputStream to String In Java”, it gave me a five-step procedure with exactly the same code as in the article:</p>
    <pre>public static String convertInputStreamToString(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
    StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    String line;
    while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
        stringBuilder.append(line).append(&#34;\n&#34;);
    }
    bufferedReader.close();
    return stringBuilder.toString();
}
</pre>
    <h2>Hello, it&#39;s 2023</h2>
    <p>Most of the time, when I want to read a string, it&#39;s in a file. Java 11, released in 2018, has  methods</p>
    <pre>public static String readString(Path path) // UTF-8
public static String readString(Path path, Charset cs)
</pre>
    <p>in the <code>java.nio.file.Files</code> class. No need for buffered readers or loops.</p>
    <p>What if I read the string from a URL? Of course, I can use <code>HttpClient</code>, also a part of Java 11:</p>
    <pre>HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder().build();
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
   .uri(URI.create(&#34;https://horstmann.com/index.html&#34;))
   .GET()
   .build();
HttpResponse&lt;String&gt; response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
String result = response.body();
</pre>
    <p>Ok, maybe that&#39;s a bit heavy-handed. I could just call</p>
    <pre>InputStream in = new URL(&#34;https://horstmann.com/index.html&#34;).openStream();
</pre>
    <p>And then I need to turn an <code>InputStream</code> into a string. But not with a loop. In 2017, Java 9 was released, and <code>InputStream</code> gained a method <code>readAllBytes</code>:</p>
    <pre>var result = new String(in.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
</pre>
    <p>And, thanks to <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/400">JEP 400</a>, as of Java 18, you don&#39;t need <code>StandardCharsets.UTF_8</code> anymore. (Assuming, of course, that the contents is actually in UTF-8. But hey, it&#39;s 2023.)</p>
    <h2>Common I/O Tasks Without Loops</h2>
    <p>To read text from a file, use one of these methods:</p>
    <pre>String contents = Files.readString(path);
List&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.readAllLines(path);
Stream&lt;String&gt; lineStream = Files.lines(path);
</pre>
    <p>If you need to read numbers, words, or characters instead of lines, then use a scanner:</p>
    <pre>var in = new Scanner(path);
in.useDelimiter(&#34;\\PL+&#34;);
Stream&lt;String&gt; words = in.tokens();
</pre>
    <p>If you already have your output in a string or a collection of lines, use:</p>
    <pre>Files.writeString(path, contents);
Files.write(path, lines); // <cite>lines is any <code>Iterable&lt;String&gt;</code></cite>
</pre>
    <p>With binary data, there are</p>
    <pre>byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(path);
Files.write(path, bytes);
</pre>

    <p>The “Complete Guide” article proposes a second method for reading a string from an input stream:</p>
    
    <pre>public static String convertInputStreamToString(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    ByteArrayOutputStream result = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int length;
    while ((length = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        result.write(buffer, 0, length);
    }
    return result.toString(&#34;UTF-8&#34;);
}</pre>
    <p>This is also unnecessarily complex. Since Java 9, <code>InputStream</code> has a method <code>transferTo</code>, and the loop can be replaced with:</p>
    <pre>in.transferTo(result);
</pre>
    <h2>What about BufferedReader and BufferedWriter?</h2>
    <p>It is unlikely that you want to use these classes in 2023. If you write your own lexer and read input a character at a time, a <code>BufferedReader</code> still makes sense. But that&#39;s a very specialized task.</p>
    <p>For most text processing tasks, it is simpler to read the entire text into a string or a list of strings, with one of the convenience methods that you just saw. If you need to break up each line into fields, call <code>line.split(delimiterRegex)</code> or construct a <code>new Scanner(line)</code> for each line.</p>    
    <p>I cannot imagine ever needing a <code>BufferedWriter</code>. For hand-crafted output, you are better off with a <code>PrintWriter</code> since it has methods for formatting. Weirdly enough, you still need a <code>File</code>, not a <code>Path</code>, to construct one:</p>
    <pre>var writer = new PrintWriter(path.toFile());
</pre>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol><li>Apparently, <a href="https://foojay.io/today/9-outdated-ideas-about-java">there is a myth</a> that Java has been frozen in time somewhere around 2010. It ain&#39;t so. The API is tweaked all the time, and the language evolves in small and large ways.</li>
      <li>Before writing a loop to transfer blocks of characters or bytes, look whether there is a convenience method. </li>
      <li>You probably don&#39;t need a <code>BufferedReader</code> or <code>BufferedWriter</code>.</li>
      <li>If a common task seems hard to do in Java, check the modern API. The <a href="https://javaalmanac.io">https://javaalmanac.io</a> site is your friend. Or check out <a href="https://horstmann.com/corejava">Core Java</a>, which, all modesty aside, is generally up to date.</li>
      <li>If your task is still onerous with the latest Java API, kvetch to the developers. Find the appropriate <a href="https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo">mailing list</a>, read through the archives, and then post your suggestion. In my experience, thoughtful requests receive thoughtful responses.</li>

For example, learning French.  I would like to speak French.  The consequence of not putting in the hours conjugating verbs means I will not be able to speak French.  That makes me sad.  I consider that sadness, and conclude I would prefer to spend the next hour reinforcing my knowledge of the passe compose of avoir.  That is better than feeling sad.</p><p>Some consequences are not obvious, but cumulative.  I don&#39;t really want to go to the stand-up meeting.  What happens if I don&#39;t go today?  Probably not much.  But what happens if I don&#39;t go for the rest of the week, or my attendance is patchy?  It&#39;ll be noticed, and I&#39;ll have to explain why I am not on the calls.  The thought of the explanation makes me uncomfortable, more uncomfortable than going to the calls.  Therefore I go to the calls.</p><p>Where this technique is powerful is that it enables me to filter out those activities where there is no obvious consequence of not doing the thing, which means the activities that remain on my daily list are generally pretty important.

If nothing else, it makes you dependable and you can be proud of your virtuous follow-through.</p><p>Doing things only to prevent the penalty feels like a negative way of looking at things and, for my monkey mind, one that is ultimately doomed to fail. Instead of aiming for the stars, my mind just gets better at dealing with the penalties. It might just be me though.

Procrastinating is usually done out of desperation, seeking for some way to feel better to hopefully return to the task and make progress. Everything I do is pretty miserable while the task remains to be done. I’m trying to give myself a way to start. “I’ll just do it tonight” would be nearly unthinkable.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Towards &#34;tonight&#34; right away, because it&#39;s just 15 minutes, just to re-schedule it for tomorrow when &#34;tonight&#34;
has arrived. It&#39;s just 15 mins after all, right. &#34;Could do it anytime...&#34;<p>I&#39;d think the definitions seem similar. The avoidance strategies usually have slightly different hotspots, though.

When I was mostly focused on a single issue at a time for long strench of time, I used to be reluctant to call people and didn&#39;t really plan things for my personnal life. As my job shifted towards more organisational responsibilities and I had to start both carefully planning how I use my own time and spending a lot more time contacting people to get things done, these things started slowly expanding to the rest of my time by cheer force of habit. What is one more call to the guy who should have trimmed the tree when you have spent the day asking people why they are behind schedule?<p>I think it goes well with the anxiety explanation. You are obviously less anxious about things which are just business as usual. I guess my take away would be that if you want to start doing something you find hard, it will get easier and easier as you stick with it, which is pretty nice when you think about it.

Then it&#39;s just impossible. Cheapest way to resolve these, which often appears automatically, is quick rationalization - creating a special case, &#34;yes, but&#34;, &#34;this is different&#34; etc. But when you are honest with yourself and observe yourself, do some debugging, it&#39;s impossible to not be doing something you want to be doing (and vice versa).</p><p>For me, it often means not that now I want to do these tasks and I&#39;m going at them, rather, I understand that e.g. I think there are more important things in life to me given the wider context and I&#39;m perfectly fine not doing them.</p><p>I have not been doing anything I wouldn&#39;t want to be doing right now for years.

It helped me get over seeing myself as the center of the narrative, and made me realize everyone else was too trapped in theirs to notice most of the flaws I saw in myself. It also helped me come to terms with how the world being fucked up is neither my fault or something I can fix.
But the real, true house on the cliff is unattainable. In the darkest and most honest moments, I&#39;d admit it&#39;s not even what I want. As my ex&#39;s mother once said, I thrive on crisis. She didn&#39;t mean it well.

You would think cleaning up shit is just that, it sucks regardless. But my experience is different. If you keep repeating to yourself false narration &#34;I don&#39;t want to be doing this&#34; that&#39;s hell.

It&#39;s enough to try to satisfy your needs and doing what you want. But be observant and introspect.</p><p>People who are perceived as egoists are not optimizing for their own well being.

It&#39;s you, it&#39;s your need. It feels good. Not just a fleeting high, but like a feeling about your life in general. We seem to have that built in.</p><p>I mean regardless of the source, just look how it&#39;s unnecessarily nested narration. Your needs vs needs of others, where needs of others is what you feel is needed to do for others. It&#39;s still your needs, if you think you should be helping others it&#39;s you who feels that.

The inner worlds of different human beings can be radically different. Sometimes we forget that and assume our experiences or ways of experiencing are universal. Some people have aphantasia, others (more lucky perhaps) don&#39;t have akrasia or at the very least can sufficiently overcome it by bringing to mind whether or not one wants to do the task at-hand.

It may be tiring, but it just flows. This is what I call effortless in this context. Because it does not require any willpower to do it, even if it requires thinking or strength. You are locked in.</p><p>I mean whether it&#39;s coding or gym, surely you must have experienced it. When you are in the middle of the activity and you are not questioning whether you should be doing it or not.</p><p>The state of flow is familiar to most coders. Coding is nice because your mind is so busy building the castle that there is no place to be thinking about yourself. There is just code. So you are not questioning whether coding is something that you currently want to be doing. The same state can be achieved doing just about anything and to me the trick is to make narration without contradictions. Out of all things in the world, given my current life context writing this comment is the thing I want to do the most. Even if nobody reads it.</p><p>Btw I don&#39;t have that luxury 100% of the time. I can get hang up on the question of what do I actually want (in my case it usually drops down to not being honest with myself regarding the fact that what I really want is more sleep).</p><p>Regarding not liking situation, one that you choose to be in. I&#39;ve had big mental shift from thinking in patterns of &#34;lesser evil&#34; and choosing what you want packages from the reality you are in (i.e. dropping wishful thinking). IT seems subtle but it&#39;s not.</p><p>&#34;You choose to do it because you want it done. It is an axiom.&#34; is the right track. But not liking it, is the same as not liking that the sky is not green. It&#39;s fair, you might have preferred the green sky by a lot, but it&#39;s so ridiculous that you wouldn&#39;t experience anything negative because of that. It&#39;s the same with reality you are in and options available to you.

There&#39;s no reason to try to outsmart yourself. If you are excited about the future associated with some task (or about the future in general) you are excited about doing the task. Some grim outlook on the future makes it rational to optimize short term results. E.g. sleep deprivation gives a glimpse of that.<p>Basically seems pointless to fight with yourself. Maybe you don&#39;t really want the long-term task + result package. Or maybe wishful thinking is causing you to fantasize about getting a result without doing the task. (I&#39;m sorry about using second person, seems most straightforward way to communicate it).</p><p>I guess there&#39;s also some element of narration creating fictional character - e.g. I can&#39;t stop playing chess - playing chess is who I am.

Good luck and Godspeed.</p><p>Maybe I&#39;m more of a clinical case, but for me, whatever I think the source of anxiety is in any given scenario, it&#39;s never that. I can eliminate potential sources one by one, dig in recursively, but it only provides very short-lived feelings of relief, lasting seconds to minutes, before anxiety restarts. To make matters worse, the more I spend time on such investigations, the more anxious I get about not working on the actual thing I wanted/was supposed to.</p><p>The most accurate model/explanation I have for this is: anxiety always comes, unconditionally; any &#34;reason&#34; behind it is just desperate post-hoc rationalization. The only reliable defense I know of is to be doing something so interesting or stimulating that it captures all of the brain&#39;s compute and starves the &#34;anxiety process&#34; entirely. Of course, that process will restart as soon as resources for it become available.</p><p>&gt; <i>For instance, if you have problems submitting your timesheets on time, it could be due to the fact that you&#39;re worried about putting too many hours on the budget. If you remove the worry about putting too many hours on the budget, then you might find yourself doing your timesheets on time.</i></p><p>I have problems submitting my timesheets on time. It&#39;s mostly because it&#39;s a boring, mind-dumbing chore, done using a GUI designed to prove that evil exists in this world. Like all modern timesheet tools, this one resists automation too. It&#39;s an annoyance that distracts me from the actual work I&#39;m already behind on thanks to anxiety, and thus compounding the latter.</p><p>Yes, the task takes maybe 5 minutes. Would, if I could focus. But my focus window for mind-dumbingly boring tasks and routines is around 30 seconds; anything more than that requires ongoing, conscious effort. In reality, those 5 minutes usually turn into one hour, by the end of which I&#39;m all dripping from stress-induced sweating.</p><p>I mean, I could&#39;ve done my timesheets for the last two weeks four times over, in the time it took me to write this comment. Yet somehow, this comment is up, and the timesheets are not.

Some examples:<p>1) As I got used to finally being able to decide to do something, and then actually follow through without first having to win a mini-boss fight in my head, my perception of whole classes of tasks shifted - things I assumed were hard, or instinctively avoided, became things I knew I could do. This is good and how it should be, but what I didn&#39;t realize is that this state of things is still quite fragile. At some point I overloaded myself with responsibilities, and as I hit my limit, I started to slip up, which cracked my newfound trust in my own reliability - and things quickly spiraled down from there. Even though things got better, and they are better than they were before I was diagnosed, my self-image got seriously damaged. Even after half a year, I still haven&#39;t fully recovered.</p><p>2) I am a night person. Always have been. Whatever the reason underlying the reasons for this is, the meds didn&#39;t do much about it. What they did, however, is allow me to get away with much less sleep. This was super useful when my second daughter was born, as it made it easy for me to take the &#34;first shift&#34;, feeding and changing the baby and letting my wife sleep more. Shift the meds schedule around to have one dose at 23:00, and I could do some work <i>and</i> care for the kid until 02:00, then sleep some 5 hours, and feel well-rested in the morning. Of course, this was not sustainable; there were two major bad consequences:</p><p>- &#34;Sleep debt&#34; kept accumulating, but since it was masked by my carefully-tuned med schedule, it took me way too long to notice I&#39;m getting slower and less focused at everything.</p><p>- The whole experience broke my internal rhythm that told me when to go to sleep. And with overall improved executive functioning, it only became easier to stay up late.</p><p>3) It also took me a while to realize that the meds are &#34;sticky&#34;. That is, they make it easy to stay on course - wherever that course lead. While they also make it easier to switch tasks, the improved focus makes it harder to notice that I should switch. As a result, whatever I&#39;m doing when the meds kick in, is what I&#39;ll most likely continue to be doing for the next couple hours. Whether that&#39;s work, or writing HN comments.</p><p>3a) This &#34;stickiness&#34; also makes it easier to waste time going too deep into low-value tangential tasks. Like e.g. that time when I was working on a bug that turned out to be a regex issue - specifically, someone assembled a regex by concatenating some string constants, and didn&#39;t notice a subtle bug. As I fixed it, I decided to make sure such bugs don&#39;t happen again. I started writing some utility functions, and... few days later, I ended up committing a small library for making regexes via composition, which structurally prevented the class of bugs like the one I was originally fixing. Suffice it to say, those few days could&#39;ve been better used on some other tasks. After that experience, I learned to pay attention to early signs of going too far off tangents. That&#39;s definitely a med problem - before diagnosis, my procrastination would&#39;ve stopped me from pursuing such tangents too far.</p><p>(Or, in other words: meds make it easy to do the tasks that, before, I had to fight myself to do - but that fighting also served as a filter, forcing me to repeatedly consider whether the thing is worth doing at all.)</p><p>All in all, I&#39;m still adjusting. Many of the changes - both positive and negative - take a long time to become apparent.

I’d think, “the trash should go out”, which for a procrastinator usually starts a whole internal dialog full of bargaining about how the pickup isn’t for two days so I’ll just take it out the next time I put something in the can and it’ll be fine. And then go back to whatever I was doing or not doing.<p>The first time this happened on the too high dose, the next thing I knew I was standing at the garbage can closing the lid, and wondering how the fuck did that happen? Now I was having side effects too but the feeling of mild disassociation was deeply disturbing, and got stronger when the pills wore off and I could reflect back on the day. So we cut the dose by about 40%.</p><p>I suspect half of why it works is that anything that treats depression probably also reduces anxiety and self defeating behaviors, in addition to stringing longer lists of tasks together, which is why it works off label for some classes of notorious procrastinators.</p><p>I was talking to my therapist about this a couple weeks ago (I’m trying something different now and it’s not working), and I asserted that a procrastinator - or at least an adult one - will never willingly take a mind altering substance that 100% eliminates the thought of procrastination because while it’s absolutely not the best part of who we are, it <i>is</i> part of who we are. Ideally for me, and I think for many others, you would hit the point were your brain still says, “we could do this tomorrow!” sometimes, but you choose to ignore that voice and do it anyway.

I&#39;m hyperthyroid;</p><p>- I&#39;m busy being afraid of something that could happen to me soon, over which I have no control, or the only control I have is to turn a probable bad thing into 100% sure bad thing; because of that, I am fully on auto-pilot and unable to process anything that requires expending effort to stay focused;</p><p>- What? What task? Oh sorry, I was busy trying to calm myself down from an anxiety attack and completely forgot. But now you reminding me is shooting my anxiety back, so kindly please GTFO; I may or may not do the thing, depending on how long it&#39;ll take me to calm myself down again.</p><p>Etc.</p><p>&#34;Lazy&#34; is a pure judgement. It doesn&#39;t care about reasons - it&#39;s a statement that &#34;this person cannot be relied on&#34;. Which would be fair if used only to manage expectations, but it&#39;s actually used as a blunt weapon - a crude attempt to <i>make</i> someone reliable by guilt-tripping and peer pressure.</p><p>EDIT: a few more reasons:</p><p>- Whenever I attempt this task, my mind blanks out. Don&#39;t know why. But it&#39;s so bad that I can&#39;t even break things down into smaller steps.</p><p>- Two or three times, I poured all my heart and effort into doing this, and not only you weren&#39;t satisfied with the results, you actually ridiculed me for them and accused of not caring, while at no point explaining what your definition of &#34;good result&#34; is. So guess what, this thing got crossed off the list of possible things I could be doing, at a subconscious level. I&#39;m unable to recognize this is a task to be done, unless you request it directly. Which I hope you won&#39;t. Fuck you.</p><p>- <i>(4 year old version of the above)</i> I tried my best, you didn&#39;t even notice, told me I did nothing, and even screamed at me. I&#39;m now experiencing a panic attack when you ask me to do it, which blanks my mind out and freezes me in place. You calling me lazy and screaming more and throwing away my toys doesn&#39;t help. Good job at parenting you&#39;re doing there.</p><p>- <i>(with apologies to &#39;coldtea)</i> The reason you see me constantly &#34;relaxing&#34; and &#34;having fun&#34; is because I&#39;m constantly 5 minutes away from curling up on the floor and crying. There is no &#34;fun vs. work&#34;, there is only &#34;fun vs. pain&#34;.</p><p>All of the reasons I listed are things I&#39;ve either experienced or dealt with people who were experiencing them.

So it&#39;s completely meaningless, except for the part of describing behavior, and cannot be used as an explanation - i.e. &#34;he didn&#39;t do his homework because he&#39;s lazy&#34; is a circular statement.

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read articles or watched videos precisely about procrastination etc. just like this article -- and it did nothing to help you with your own procrastination (and the other millions of people that are procrastinating). Every such article has a goal of &#34;be happier&#34; &#34;be less anxious&#34; &#34;stop procrastinating&#34; etc. but what they&#39;re essentially saying is &#34;be happy&#34;, or &#34;don&#39;t procrastinate&#34; etc. After stating the overall trite, they go into personal details about what worked for them to address the trite. However the details are usually highly personal and won&#39;t work for you or anyone really who doesn&#39;t have the same belief (system/thought pattern/mentality/personality) as the author. In fact the author mentioned this himself in the article by pointing out that not everyone thinks the same as you (So then: why are you telling us about the implementation details of the solution to the trite instead of really drilling into what thinking led for the implementation to be effective?) At which point do you stop drilling into your meta-thinking? It&#39;s hard to know, and it&#39;s hard to drill-down as well and as you drill-down things become more personal and not applicable to a general audience.</span></p></div></td></tr>

However, when the author finally reached out, Fallon expressed appreciation and saw it as a sign of thoroughness rather than a burden. This interaction made the author question other ideas they had deemed bad. The article suggests asking simple questions to challenge our assumptions: Why do I think it&#39;s a bad idea? How do I actually know it&#39;s a bad idea? Am I the only one who thinks this? What&#39;s the worst that can happen if I&#39;m wrong? The author encourages seeking social information and considering others&#39; experiences before making a decision. They also share a personal realization about asking for favors, discovering that it can strengthen relationships instead of burdening others. The article concludes by encouraging readers to take risks, embrace possibilities, and engage with the world to gain experiences and potentially benefit others. The author also refers to a previous newsletter about focusing on one&#39;s strengths rather than trying to do everything.

&#34;Are we to assume Lee had a hand in creating every Marvel character?&#34; Neal Kirby, son of the influential Marvel co-creator, says.</p>

<a href="https://ew.com/article/2014/09/29/why-kirby-v-marvel-mattered/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Jack Kirby</a>&#39;s son released a blistering statement about the newest Disney+ documentary about the life and legacy of Marvel legend <a href="https://ew.com/person/stan-lee/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">Stan Lee</a>.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2">
In the memo shared by his daughter Jillian on social media, Neal Kirby challenges the notion that Lee &#34;had a hand in creating every Marvel character,&#34; arguing that his father, the late <a href="https://ew.com/books/2017/10/27/jack-kirby-king-of-comic-books/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Jack Kirby, the co-creator of many Marvel hits</a> including Fantastic Four, Hulk, and Thor, and Lee&#39;s frequent collaborator, has for too long been overshadowed by Lee.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">
&#34;It&#39;s not any big secret that there has always been controversy over the parts that were played in the creation and success of Marvel&#39;s characters,&#34; Kirby began, acknowledging that he understands that the documentary is about, well, Lee. &#34;Stan Lee had the fortunate circumstance to have access to the corporate megaphone and media, and he used these to create his own mythos as to the creation of the Marvel character pantheon. He made himself the voice of Marvel.&#34;
</p>



<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-8">
&#34;It should also be noted and is generally accepted that Stan Lee had a limited knowledge of history, mythology, or science,&#34; Kirby wrote. &#34;On the other hand, my father&#39;s knowledge of these subjects, to which I and many others can personally attest, was extensive. Einstein summed it up better: &#39;More the knowledge, lesser the ego. Lesser the knowledge, more the ego.&#39;&#34;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-10">
He continued, &#34;Are we to assume Lee had a hand in creating every Marvel character? Are we to assume that it was never the other co-creator that walked into Lee&#39;s office and said, &#39;Stan I have a great idea for a character!&#39; According to Lee, it was always his idea.&#34;
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-12">
&#34;My father retired from comic books in the early 1980s and of course passed away in 1994,&#34; Kirby added. &#34;Lee had over 35 years of uncontested publicity, much naturally, with the backing and blessing of Marvel as he boosted the Marvel brand as a side effect of boosting himself.&#34; Citing Lee&#39;s many cameos in Marvel films, &#34;thus cementing his status as the creator of all things Marvel,&#34; Kirby added, &#34;My father&#39;s first screen credit didn&#39;t appear until the closing crawl at the end of the film adaptation of Iron Man in 2008, after Stan Lee, Don Heck, and Larry Lieber.&#34;

&#34;The battle for creator&#39;s rights has been around since the first inscribed Babylonian tablet,&#34; Kirby concluded. &#34;It&#39;s way past time to at least get this one chapter of literary/art history right.&#34;

In <em>Stan Lee</em> (out now on Disney+), director David Gelb traces Lee&#39;s upbringing as Stanley Leiber to his rise to influence in the world of comic books and pop culture in Lee&#39;s own words, via personal archive material. <a href="https://ew.com/news/2018/11/12/marvel-comics-legend-stan-lee-dies-at-95/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Lee died in 2018</a> from heart failure at age 95. Kirby, who similarly died of heart failure in 1994 at age 76, was also an influential comic book writer and artist behind iconic superheroes Black Panther, Captain America, the Celestials, and the X-Men, among others.

EW has reached out to Lee&#39;s estate and Disney+ for comment on Kirby&#39;s statement.
