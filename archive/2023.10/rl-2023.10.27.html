The lunch rush. The columns of headphone-equipped tech workers rushing in and out of train stations. The lanyard-wearing visitors who crowded the sidewalks when a big conference was in town.</p><p>There was a time three years ago when a walk through downtown San Francisco was a picture of what it meant for a city to be economically successful. Take the five-minute jaunt from the office building at 140 New Montgomery Street to a line-out-the-door salad shop nearby.</p><p>The 26-story building, an Art Deco landmark that was once the <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://140nm.com/%23:~:text=140%20Stories-,A%20HISTORIC%20ICON,dominating%20the%20city&#39;s%20young%20skyline." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tallest in the city</a>, began its life as the headquarters for the Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. Decades later, it served as the home of the local search company Yelp. The nearby salad store was part of a fast-growing chain called <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.mixt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mixt</a>.</p><p>Yelp and Mixt had little more than proximity in common, which at that time was enough. Yelp was an idea that became billions of dollars in value on the internet. Mixt was a booming business serving lunchtime salads to the workers who traveled on electrified trains and <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-longer-for-punks-skateboards-cater-to-yuppie-commuters-1401847791" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">skateboards</a> to their jobs in downtown cubicles.</p></div><div><p>Their virtuous cycle of nearness, of new ideas becoming new companies, feeding other ideas that become other companies, was the template for urban growth. Businesses like Yelp took root in the high-energy, high-density city; chains like Mixt flourished alongside them as their workers ventured out for lunch. As downtowns have emptied out, their once-symbiotic relationship is coming undone.</p><p>“This area was always packed with people,” recalled Maria Cerros-Mercado, a Mixt manager who built her career in food service downtown. “People would get off the BART, buy coffee, buy this, buy that. There was always just so much walking.”</p><p>Today San Francisco has what is perhaps the most deserted major downtown in America. On any given week, office buildings are at about 40 percent of their prepandemic occupancy, while the vacancy rate has jumped to 24 percent from 5 percent since 2019. Occupancy of the city’s offices is roughly 7 percentage points below that of those in the average major American city, according to Kastle, the building security firm.</p></div><div

that its downtown business district — the bedrock of its economy and tax base — revolves around a technology industry that is uniquely equipped and enthusiastic about letting workers stay home indefinitely. In the space of a few months, Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, went from running a company that was rooted in the city to vacating Yelp’s longtime headquarters and allowing its roughly 4,400 employees to work from anywhere in their country.</p></div><div><p>“I feel like I’ve seen the future,” he said.</p><p>Decisions like that, played out across thousands of remote and hybrid work arrangements, have forced office owners and the businesses that rely on them to figure out what’s next. This has made the San Francisco area something of a test case in the multibillion-dollar question of what the nation’s central business districts will look like when an increased amount of business is done at home.</p><p>“Imagine a forest where an entire species suddenly disappears,” said Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies urban real estate. “It disrupts the whole ecosystem and produces a lot of chaos. The same thing is happening in downtowns.”</p><p>The city’s chief economist, Ted Egan, has warned about a looming loss of tax revenue as vacancies pile up. Brokers have tried to counter that narrative by talking up a “flight to quality” in which companies upgrade to higher-end space. Business groups and city leaders hope to recast the urban core as a more residential neighborhood built around people as well as businesses but leave out that office rents would <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/business/office-buildings-real-estate-vacancy.html" target="_blank" title="">probably have to plunge</a> for those plans to be viable.</p><p>Below the surface of spin is a downtown that is trying to adapt to what amounts to a three-day workweek.

email service before morphing into the local review and directory site that is now worth about $2 billion. That he had a good idea was less important to the company’s success than the Bay Area’s tech ecosystem — the experience and social connections Mr. Stoppelman gained from his previous job at PayPal helped him procure $1 million in start-up funding.</p></div><div><p>Another factor, Mr. Stoppelman said, was a crucial decision, unusual at the time, to locate the company in a San Francisco office building instead of a Silicon Valley office park.</p><p>“I’m not sure that Yelp would have succeeded if we weren’t in the city,” he said. “When you’re in a city, there’s lots of places you might go, and an efficient way to sort through the possibilities is important. Yelp was a killer app for the city.”</p><p>San Francisco is about 40 miles from the heart of Silicon Valley, which for the most part consists of low-slung suburban cities that sit along U.S. 101 and have sprawling office campuses surrounded by acres of parking. Until fairly recently, however, the city was considered a subpar place for start-ups.</p><p>The downtown business district had historically revolved around banks and insurance companies. And the wave of tech companies that sprouted up in San Francisco during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s became symbols of that period’s delusions when they went out of business during the dot-com bust. Mr. Stoppelman said the surplus of fly-by-night companies gave credence to a joke that circulated around PayPal: Start-ups do better in the suburbs because their workers have less to do outside the office.</p><p>But the bust provided an opportunity in the form of cheap office space that proliferated through the city’s South of Market neighborhood, which sits next to the financial district. Besides, for a new generation of start-up founders like Mr. Stoppelman, who was in his 20s and single when Yelp started, the city just seemed more fun.</p><p>In San Francisco, and around the country, a growing preference for urban living was showing up in surveys, condo prices and pour-over coffee shops. Economists like Edward Glaeser at Harvard and Richard Florida at the University of Toronto distilled this movement into a sort of new urban theory that said cities were benefiting from several converging trends, including a more tech-driven economy, plunging crime rates and the bubble of young millennials entering the work force.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" old-srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" old-srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" old-srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="An empty downtown San Francisco." decoding="async" loading="lazy" new-cursrc="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp" old-src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" old-srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/12/18/multimedia/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2/15Downtown-walkway-1-32f2-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" src="https://archive.ph/Env83/fe10eb7fcad04e2034da43c9dada980b01d106bc.webp"/></picture></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Downtown San Francisco is trying to adapt to what amounts to a three-day workweek.

He parlayed the book’s success into a consulting firm, the Creative Class Group, which advises cities on strategies for attracting young workers.</p></div><div><p>The advice — find educated workers, create dense fun neighborhoods and embrace social liberalism — could be reduced, effectively, to “become more like San Francisco.”</p><p>An irony of San Francisco’s emerging status as an economic bellwether was that until the Great Recession, when a plunge in tax revenue prompted the local government to go scrambling for ways to stimulate growth, the city had made no special effort to attract tech companies. In the wake of the downturn, however, the city altered its tax code to be more welcoming to start-ups, while office owners started offering the shorter leases start-ups desire and open floor plans that allow companies to cram more people together.</p><p>Less than a decade later, a city that was never more than a Silicon Valley satellite was the epicenter of a new boom, with companies like Twitter, Lyft, Uber, Dropbox, Reddit and Airbnb all setting up inside the city limits. And the employees who worked there needed lunch.</p><p>Ms. Cerros-Mercado, who grew up in the city, watched this unfold while building her career at Specialty’s, a local cafe and sandwich chain known for its giant cookies. She started working there for about $10 an hour and regarded it as a stopping off point that would help support her children as she went through college, with the hopes that she would later go to nursing school.</p><p>But she came to like it and rose from being a cashier to a kitchen manager and then general manager who made $80,000 with time off, along with dental and health benefits. The main location where she worked was downtown, next to a Mixt restaurant whose lines spilled onto the street.</p><h2 id="link-2a894e35">The Creative Class and Its Discontents</h2></div><div

looking for the trifecta of fast, healthy and filling, few meals are more efficient than a pile of veggies and some dressing swirled with tofu or grilled chicken. Unfortunately, the aspirations of a salad are often dashed by the difficulty of making one that is actually good. The ingredients come from every corner of the supermarket, and if they aren’t combined in the right proportions, or if they are made too far in advance, every bite is a drag.</p><p>Ms. Silverglide, 42, the chief executive of Mixt, tried to solve this problem with a setup in which customers proceeded down a counter and called out ingredients like grilled chicken and roasted brussels sprouts while stipulating exactly how much dressing they wanted. She said the naysayers of the time told her that there weren’t enough salad eaters to sustain her company, or that only women would eat there.</p><p>Instead, lines extended down the block, and Yelp’s users gave the business three and a half stars. People like Mike Ghaffary discovered a healthier kind of lunch in a restaurant where customization was encouraged.</p><p>Mr. Ghaffary is a former Yelp executive and serial optimizer who went to Mixt in search of a vegan meal that was high in protein and low in sugar. The salad he came up with paired lentils, chickpeas and quinoa with greens and a cilantro jalapeño vinaigrette.</p><p>Over the next several years, as Yelp grew and went public, Mixt thrived alongside it, adding a dozen locations through downtown and other city neighborhoods. Mr. Ghaffary became something of a Mixt evangelist (“He was very proud of the beany salad he came up with,” Mr. Stoppelman said) and ordered his vegetal concoction so frequently that the salad was added to the permanent menu and still sits on the board under the name “Be Well.”</p><p>In the city, however, well-being was taking a hit.</p><p>The tech companies that San Francisco had tried so hard to attract were now the target of regular protests, including some by demonstrators who at the end of 2013 began blocking commuter buses from Google and other companies to show their rage at rents that now sit at a <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/market-trends/san-francisco-ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">median of $3,600</a>. This was an opening gesture in what would become an ongoing debate about gentrification and the effect of tech companies on the city — a debate that played out in arguments over <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/billionaire-tech-investors-support-divisive-plan-to-ban-san-franciscos-homeless-camps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">homeless camps</a>, votes to stop <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Moratorium-on-new-Mission-District-housing-is-6609187.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">development</a> and countless more protests.</p><p>All of this was rooted in the cost of housing, which had been expensive for decades but had morphed into a disaster. A local government that had all but begged tech companies to set up shop there was now pushing a raft of new taxes to deal with its spiraling affordable housing and <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco,_California,_Proposition_C,_Gross_Receipts_Tax_for_Homelessness_Services_(November_2018)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">homelessness problems</a>.

Such is the case with Yelp, which long ago started moving employees in response to San Francisco’s rising cost of living, opening sales offices around the country and new engineering hubs in London and Toronto.</p><p>Still, it was hard to see how that might pose any kind of threat to the city, whose greatest challenge seemed to be dealing with the <em>too many </em>jobs it already had.</p><p>Expansions aside, Yelp was still ensconced in its headquarters at 140 New Montgomery, and by early 2020, it had every intention of signing a new lease. The company’s ties to San Francisco, the hold of the creative class and all that, were too strong to imagine anything in its place.</p><h2 id="link-5beb4acc">Headquartered in the Cloud</h2><p>“Have you heard about Covid?”</p><p>Ms. Cerros-Mercado remembers asking a regional manager at Specialty’s that question sometime in February or early March of 2020. The virus had been in the news for weeks, but it didn’t seem like more than a seasonal bug until her 19-year-old daughter’s school trip to Spain was canceled. The manager she asked wasn’t so sure.</p><p>“He’s like, ‘Oh, it’s just a flulike virus; it will go away,’” she said. “And I’m looking at him and telling him, ‘No, this is actually really serious.’”</p><p>Ms. Cerros-Mercado described the following weeks as a blur of plunging sales and eerie moments like standing in a coffee shop with no customers or hearing from a janitor that the offices above them were clearing out. By May, Specialty’s had filed for <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2020/05/28/specialtys-liquidation-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Chapter 7 bankruptcy</a> after a conference call in which she and other managers were thanked for their service and told they would be employed for three more days, during which they would deliver the news they had just received to the people who worked for them.</p></div><div><p>“One of the hardest conversations was having to talk to my team,” she said. “I had some team members that were crying because they weren’t sure where their income was going to come from.”</p><p>In that moment, the question was when life would return to how it was. But as Mr. Stoppelman discovered that he could run a publicly traded company from his home with no loss of business, he decided that for his company, anyway, the new normal was better. Yelp abandoned its headquarters when the lease at 140 New Montgomery lapsed, joining a growing list of tech companies that had replaced free cafeterias and Ping-Pong breakrooms — which for more than a decade had been rationalized by a belief that a social company was a more innovative company — with slogans like “headquartered in the cloud.”</p><p>Yelp ended up adding back about 50,000 feet for employees who want an occasional desk, but for the city that figure is even smaller than it seems. The new offices are one-third of its former footprint; Yelp subleased the space from Salesforce — the city’s largest private employer, which is also <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.sfchronicle.com/realestate/article/Salesforce-gives-up-another-big-chunk-of-office-17301088.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cutting back</a> on local offices.</p><p>The emptying of American downtowns after Covid was followed by a boom in <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/29/business/economy/new-home-building-suburbs.html" target="_blank" title="">exurban housing</a> and in cities like <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/magazine/real-estate-pandemic.html" target="_blank" title="">Austin</a> and <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Env83/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/economy/spokane-housing-expensive-cities.html" target="_blank" title="">Spokane</a>, trends reflected in where Yelp’s work force has landed. Cortney Ward, 41, a Yelp product designer, bought a home in Austin after leaving her one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco’s Nob Hill. Yelp workers also invented new habits and left holes in the businesses that relied on them. When Diego Waxemberg, 30, a software engineer, left the Bay Area for Charlotte, N.C., he started lunching on leftovers instead of sometimes buying a $17 Mixt salad with tri-tip steak. Mackenzie Bise, 30, who works in user operations, moved to the Sacramento area, and during a recent online search discovered that her favorite San Francisco lunch spot had gone out of business.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div

Cerros-Mercado went through a spell of unemployment before landing at another restaurant chain and later at Mixt. But downtown business was still somewhere between lagging and nonexistent. Mixt laid off hundreds of workers, closed most downtown stores for more than a year and subsisted on business from neighborhood and suburban stores.</p><p>“If we didn’t have the neighborhood restaurants, we wouldn’t have survived — point blank,” Ms. Silverglide said.</p></div><div><p>But for all the daily rhythms that were upended by home offices, the desire for a specially prepared lunch seems to have endured. Consider Mr. Ghaffary, creator of the Be Well salad, who used the pandemic as a challenge to recreate Mixt’s setup in the kitchen of his Marin County home. He started with fresh ingredients but got tired of his frequent trips to the grocery store and shifted to preparing them in bulk.</p><p>“I’d make like four or five days of Tupperware,” he said. “First I tried making the whole salad, and then it would get soggy. Then I made half the salad and would finish the rest at the end.”</p><p>“I was very proud of my streamlined production methods,” he continued. “And then I was kind of like, ‘I don’t want to be making these salads.’”</p><p>Mr. Ghaffary told this story over salad at Mixt’s Mill Valley store, the one Ms. Cerros-Mercado manages, which opened in July and had lines of customers in athleisure. Operations are slightly more difficult because some employees commute an hour or more to get there, most relying on buses and one sometimes trying to catch a ride in Ms. Cerros-Mercado’s Uber. When a worker misses the bus, Ms. Cerros-Mercado spends her morning trying to cover for holes in the setup line.</p><p>But the business was steady, and according to Ms. Silverglide it extends until 9 at night, catering to families and a growing salad-for-dinner segment that pairs plates of greens with the various wines and craft beers recently added to the menu. She is fairly confident that Mixt’s “neighborhood locations,” like the Mill Valley one, will drive the business’s expansion. Business in downtown San Francisco has been picking up — but it’s unclear how long that will last, or how close to prepandemic traffic it will ever reach. The offices, after all, haven’t even hit 50 percent.</p><h2 id="link-2ca9514c">Better Together</h2></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure

								<p>VMware released Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3. After five years of Spring Framework 5, these releases start a new generation for the Spring ecosystem. Spring Framework 6 requires Java 17 and Jakarta EE 9 and is compatible with the <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/09/jakarta-ee-10-updates/">recently released</a> Jakarta EE 10. It also embeds observability through Micrometer with tracing and metrics. Spring Boot 3 requires Spring Framework 6. It has built-in support for creating native executables through static Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation with GraalVM Native Image. Further details on these two releases may be found in <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/11/spring-6-spring-boot-3-launch/">this InfoQ news story</a>.</p>

<p>InfoQ spoke with <a href="https://www.infoq.com/profile/Josh-Long/">Josh Long</a>, Java Champion and first Spring Developer Advocate at VMware, about these two releases. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juergenhoeller">Juergen Hoeller</a>, Spring Framework project lead at VMware, contributed to one answer.</p>

<p><b>InfoQ: As a Spring Developer Advocate, you give talks, write code, publish articles and books, and have a podcast. What does a typical day for Josh Long look like?</b></p>


								<blockquote>
<p><strong>Josh Long</strong>: It&#39;s hard to say! My work finds me talking to all sorts of people, both in person and online, so I never know where I&#39;ll be or what work I&#39;ll focus on. Usually, though, the goal is to advance the will of the ecosystem. So that means learning about their use cases and advancing solutions to their problems. If that means talking to the Spring team and/or sending a pull request, I&#39;ll happily do that. If it means giving a presentation, recording a podcast, writing an article or a book or producing a video, then I&#39;ll do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: VMware gets feedback about Spring from many sources: conferences, user groups, issue trackers, Stack Overflow, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, and so on. But happy users typically stay silent, and the loudest complainers may not voice essential issues. So, how does VMware collect and prioritize user feedback?</b></p>


								<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: This is a very good question: everything lands in GitHub, eventually. We pay special attention to StackOverflow tags and do our best to respond to them, but if a bug is discovered there, it ultimately lands in GitHub. GitHub is a great way to impact the projects. We try to make it easy, like having labels for newcomers who want to contribute to start somewhere where we could mentor them. GitHub, of course, is not a great place for questions and answers — use Stackoverflow for that. Our focus on GitHub is so great that even within the teams themselves, we send pull requests to our own projects and use that workflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: There are many projects under the Spring umbrella. VMware has to educate Spring users about all of them. How does VMware know what Spring users don’t know so it can teach them?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: In two words: we don&#39;t. We can surmise, of course. We spend a lot of effort advancing the new, novel, the latest and greatest. But we also are constantly renewing the fundamental introductory content. You wouldn&#39;t believe how many times I&#39;ve redone the &#34;first steps in...&#34; for a particular project :) We&#39;re also acutely aware that while people landing on our portals and properties on the internet might be invested long-time users, people finding Spring through other means may know less. So are constantly putting out the &#34;your first steps in...&#34; introductory content. And anyway, sometimes &#34;the first steps in…&#34; changes enough that the fundamentals become new and novel :) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Java legacy applications often use older versions of Java and frameworks. Microservices allow developers to put new technology stacks into production at a lower risk. Do you see this more as an opportunity for Java to showcase new features and releases? Or is it more of a threat because developers can test-drive Java competitors like .NET, Go, JavaScript or Python?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: Threat? Quite the contrary: if Java reflects poorly when viewed through the prism of other languages, then it&#39;s better for that to be apparent and to act as a forcing function to propel Java forward. And, let&#39;s be honest: Java can&#39;t be the best at everything. Microservices mean we can choose to use Spring and Java for all the use cases that make sense — without feeling trapped in case Java and Spring don&#39;t offer the most compelling solution. Don&#39;t ask me what that use case is because I have no idea…</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Spring 5 added explicit Spring support for Kotlin. In your estimate, what percentage of Spring development happens in Kotlin these days?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s the second most widely used language on the Spring Initializr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Scala never got such explicit support in Spring. Why do you think that is?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: It did! We had a project called Spring Scala <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2012/12/10/introducing-spring-scala">way back in 2012</a>.  We really wanted it to work. Before we announced Spring Scala, we even had a Spring Integration DSL in Scala. We tried. It just seems like there wasn&#39;t a community that wanted it to work. Which is a pity. These days, with reactive and functional programming so front-and-center, I feel like the Java and Scala communities have more in common than ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Spring 5 also added reactive applications. Now you’re a proponent of reactive applications and even wrote a book about it. What makes reactive applications so attractive to you?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: I love reactive programming. It gives me three significant benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li role="presentation">A concise DSL in which to express the movement of state in a system — in a way that robustly addresses the volatile nature of systems through things like backpressure, timeouts, retries, etc. This concise DSL simplifies building systems, as you end up with one abstraction for all your use cases.</li>
	<li role="presentation">A concise DSL in which to write concurrent, multithreaded code — free of so much of the fraught threading and state-management logic that bedevils concurrent code.</li>
	<li role="presentation">An elegant way to write code in such a way that the runtime can better use threads to scale (i.e., handle more requests per second).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: For which problems or applications is reactive development a perfect fit?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: If reactive abstractions are suitable to your domain and you want to learn something new, reactive programming is a good fit for all workloads. Why wouldn&#39;t you want more scalable, safer (more robust), and more consistent code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ:  Where is reactive development not a good fit?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: Reactive development requires a bit of a paradigm change when writing code. It&#39;s not a drop-in replacement or a switch you can just turn on to get some scalability like Project Loom will be. If you&#39;re not interested in learning this new paradigm, and you&#39;re OK to do without the benefits only reactive programming can offer, then it makes no sense to embrace it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Common complaints about reactive development are an increased cognitive load and more difficult debugging. How valid are these complaints in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: I don&#39;t know that we&#39;re doing all that much to address these concerns directly in Spring Boot 3. The usual mechanisms still work, though! Users can put breakpoints in parts of a reactive pipeline. They can use the Reactor Tools project to capture a sort of composite stack trace from all threads in a pipeline. They can use the <code>.log()</code> and <code>.tap()</code> operators to get information about data movement through the pipeline, etc. Spring Boot 3 offers one notable improvement: Spring now supports capturing both metrics and trace information through the Micrometer Metrics and Micrometer Tracing projects. Reactor even has new capabilities to support the new Micrometer Observation abstraction in reactive pipelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: How important is tool support (such as IDEs and build tools) for the success of a framework? At least experienced users often bypass wizards and utilities and edit configuration files and code directly.</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: This is a fascinating question. I have worked really hard to make the case that tooling is not very important to the experience of the Spring Boot developer. Indeed, since Spring Boot&#39;s debut, we&#39;ve supported writing new applications with any barebones Java IDE. You don&#39;t need the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition, specialized support for Spring XML namespaces, or even the Java EE and WTP support in Eclipse to work with Spring Boot. If your tool supports <code>public static void main</code>, Apache Maven or Gradle, and the version of Java required, then you&#39;re all set! </p>

<p>And there are some places where Spring Boot got things that might benefit from tooling, like ye ole <code>application.properties</code> and <code>application.yaml</code>. But even here, you don&#39;t need tooling: Spring Boot provides the Spring Boot Actuator module, which gives you an enumeration of all the properties you might use in those files.</p>

<p>That said: it doesn&#39;t hurt when everything&#39;s literally at your fingertips. Good tooling can feel like it&#39;s whole keystrokes ahead of you. Who doesn&#39;t love that? To that end, we&#39;ve done a lot of work to make the experience for Eclipse and VS Code (and, by extension, most tools that support the Eclipse Java Language Server) developers as pleasant as possible. </p>

<p>I think good tooling is even more important as it becomes necessary to migrate existing code. A good case in point is the new Jakarta EE APIs. Jakarta EE supersedes what was Java EE: All <code>javax.*</code>  types have been migrated to <code>jakarta.*</code>. The folks at the Eclipse Foundation have taken great pains to make on-ramping to these new types as easy as possible, but it&#39;s still work that needs to be done. Work, I imagine, your IDE of choice will make it much easier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: For the first time since 2010, a Spring Framework update followed not one, but two years after the previous major release - version 5.3 in 2020. So it seems Spring Framework 6 had two years of development instead of one. What took so long? :-)  </b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: Hah. I hadn&#39;t even noticed that! If I&#39;m honest, it feels like Spring Framework 6 has been in development for a lot longer than two years. This release has been one of incredible turmoil! Moving to Java 17 has been easy, but the migration to Jakarta EE has been challenging for us as framework developers. First, we had to sanitize all of our dependencies across all the supported Spring Boot libraries. Then we worked with, waited for, and integrated all the libraries across the ecosystem, one by one, until everything was green again. It was painstaking and slow work, and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s behind us. But if we&#39;ve done our jobs right, it should be trivial for you as a developer consuming Spring Boot.</p>

<p>The work for observability has also been widespread. The gist of it is that Micrometer now supports tracing, and there&#39;s a unified abstraction for both tracing and metrics, the Observation. Now for some backstory. In Spring Boot 2.x, we introduced Micrometer to capture and propagate metrics to various time-series databases like Netflix Atlas, Prometheus, and more. Spring Framework depends on Micrometer. Spring Boot depends on Spring Framework. Spring Cloud depends on Spring Boot. And Spring Cloud Sleuth, which supports distributed tracing, depends on Spring Cloud. So supported metrics at the very bottom of the abstraction stack and distributed tracing at the very top.</p>

<p>This arrangement worked, for the most part. But it meant that we had two different abstractions to think about metrics and tracing. It also meant that Spring Framework and Spring Boot couldn&#39;t support instrumentation for distributed tracing without introducing a circular dependency. All of that changes in Spring Boot 3: Spring Framework depends on Micrometer, and Micrometer supports both tracing and metrics through an easy, unified abstraction. </p>

<p>And finally, the work for Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation with GraalVM Native Image landed officially in Spring Framework 6 (released on November 15, 2022). It has been in the works in some form or another since at least 2019. It first took the form of an experimental research project called Spring Native, where we proved the various pieces in terms of Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x. That work has been subsumed by Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3. </p>

<p><b>InfoQ:  As announced last year, the free support duration for Spring Framework 6.0 and 6.1 <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework#support">will be shorter</a>. Both are down 20% to 21.5 months, compared to 27 months for Spring 5.2. In contrast, the free support duration for Spring Boot 3.0 remains one year. Why is that?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: We standardized the way support is calculated in late 2021. We have always supported open-source releases for 12 months for free. Each project can extend that support based on release cycles and their community needs, but 12 months of open-source support and 12 months of additional commercial support is what all projects have as the minimum. It’s normal for us to further extend support for the last minor release in a major generation (as we are doing with Spring Framework 5.3.x).</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the standardization of support timelines happened at the end of 2021. We had zero major or minor Spring Framework releases since that happened. Spring Framework 6 will be the first under the new guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Juergen Hoeller: </b>It’s worth noting that the commercial support timeframe for Spring Framework 6.0 and 6.1 is shorter as well. We are not shortening the support of open-source releases in favor of commercial releases. Rather, it&#39;s all a bit tighter — the expectation is that people upgrade to the latest 6.x feature releases more quickly. Just like they also should be upgrading their JDK more quickly these days. In that sense, Spring Framework 5.x was still very much attached to the JDK 8 usage style of &#34;you may stay on your JDK level and Java EE level.&#34; Spring Framework 6.x is meant to track JDK 17+ and Jakarta EE 9+ (both release more often than before) as closely as possible, adapting the release philosophy accordingly. </p>

<p><b>InfoQ: Spring Boot 3 supports the GraalVM Native Image AOT compiler out of the box. This produces native Java applications that start faster, use less memory, have smaller container images, and are more secure. In which areas of cloud computing does this put Java on more equal footing against competitors such as Go?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d characterize Java as less or more on equal footing with Go. Regardless of Go, Java hasn&#39;t been the most memory-efficient language. This has foreclosed on some opportunities like IoT and serverless. AOT compilation with GraalVM Native Image puts it in the running while retaining Java&#39;s vaunted scalability and productivity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: In which areas of cloud computing will native Java not move the needle?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: I don&#39;t know. It feels like GraalVM Native Image will be a suitable replacement for all the places where the JRE might have otherwise been used. Indeed, GraalVM opens new doors, too. Developers can write custom Kubernetes controllers using Spring Boot now. You can write operating-system-specific client binaries like CLIs (hello, Spring Shell!).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Downsides of native Java are a slower, more complex build pipeline, less tool support, and reduced observability. The build pipeline disadvantages seem unavoidable — AOT compilation takes longer, and different operating systems need different executables. But how do you think tool support and observability in native Java will compare against dynamic Java in the medium term?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: IntelliJ already has fantastic support for debugging GraalVM native images. I don&#39;t think most people will mourn the loss of Java&#39;s vaunted portability. After all, most applications run in a Linux container running on a Linux operating system on a Linux host. That said, there is a fantastic GitHub Action that you can use to do cross-compilation, where the build runs on multiple operating systems and produces executables specific to those operating systems. You can use tools like Buildpacks (which Spring Boot integrates with out of the box, e.g.: <code>mvn -Pnative spring-boot:build-image</code>) to build and run container images on your macOS or Windows hosts. GraalVM&#39;s observability support has been hampered a bit because Java agents don&#39;t run well (yet) on in native executables. But, the aforementioned Micrometer support can sidestep a lot of those limitations and yield a more exhaustive result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Talking about observability: That’s another headline feature of Spring 6. It encompasses logging, metrics, and traces and is based on Micrometer. Java has many observability options already. Why bake another one into Spring? And why now?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: Java doesn&#39;t really have a lot of things that do what Micrometer does. And we&#39;re not baking another one — we&#39;re enhancing an existing one that predates many distinct and singly focused alternatives. Micrometer has become a de-facto standard. Many other libraries already integrate it to surface metrics:</p>

<ul>
	<li role="presentation">RabbitMQ Java client</li>
	<li role="presentation">Vert.x?</li>
	<li role="presentation">Hibernate</li>
	<li role="presentation">HikariCP</li>
	<li role="presentation">Apache Camel</li>
	<li role="presentation">Reactor</li>
	<li role="presentation">RSocket</li>
	<li role="presentation">R2DBC</li>
	<li role="presentation">DS-Proxy</li>
	<li role="presentation">OpenFeign</li>
	<li role="presentation">Dubbo</li>
	<li role="presentation">Skywalking</li>
	<li role="presentation">Resilience4J (in-progress)</li>
	<li role="presentation">Neo4J</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: How can I view and analyze the observability data from Spring 6 and Spring Boot 3 besides reading the data files directly?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: Micrometer provides a bevy of integrations with metrics tools like Graphite, Prometheus, Netflix Atlas, InfluxDB, Datadog, etc. It works with distributed tracing tools like OpenZipkin. It also integrates with OpenTelemetry (&#34;OTel&#34;), so you can speak to any OTel service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Spring Boot 3 <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/10/spring-boot-3-jax-london">won’t fully support Native Java and observability</a> in all its projects and libraries at launch. How will I know if my Spring Boot 3 application will work in native Java and provide complete observability data?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: This is only the beginning of a longer, larger journey. The surface area of the things that work well out-of-the-box with GraalVM Native Image grows almost daily. There&#39;s no definitive list, but you should know that all the major Spring projects have been working on support. It&#39;s our priority. Check out our <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests">Spring AOT Smoke Tests</a> to see which core projects have been validated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Which upcoming feature of Java excites you the most?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: I am super excited about three upcoming bodies of work: Project Loom, Project Leyden, and Project Panama. Project Loom <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/java-virtual-threads">brings lightweight green threads to the JVM</a> and promises to be a boon to scalability. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/06/project-leyden-delays-aot">Project Leyden</a> seems like it&#39;ll give the application developer more knobs and levers to constrain and thus optimize their JVM applications. One of the more dramatic constraints looks to be GraalVM Native Images. And Project Panama looks to finally make Foreign-Function access as pain-free as it is in languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, .NET, etc. These three efforts will bring Java to new frontiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: If you could make one change to Java, what would that be?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: Structural lambdas! I want real lambdas in Java. Right now, lambdas are a bit more than syntax sugar around single-abstract method interfaces. All lambdas must conform to a well-known single abstract method (SAM) interface, like <code>java.util.function.Function&lt;I,O&gt;</code>. This was fine before Java added the <code>var</code> keyword, which I love. But it&#39;s aesthetically displeasing now because of the need to tell the compiler to which interface a given lambda literal conforms. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some code in Kotlin:</p>

<pre><code>val name = &#34;Karen&#34; // a regular variable of type String
val myLambda: (String) -&gt; Int = { name -&gt; name.length } // a lambda taking a string and returning an int</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s the equivalent code in Java:</p>

<pre><code>var name = &#34;Karen&#34;;
var myLambda = new Function&lt;String, Integer&gt;() {
  @Override
  public Integer apply(String s) {
    return s.length();
  }
};</code></pre>

<p>There are ways around this: </p>

<pre><code>var name = &#34;Karen&#34;;
Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; myLambda = s -&gt; s.length(); 
</code></pre>

<p>This is what I mean by it being aesthetically displeasing: either I abandon the consistency of having both lines start with <code>var</code>, or I abandon the conciseness of the lambda notation. </p>

<p>Is this likely to ever get fixed? Probably not. Is it a severe issue? Of course not. On the whole, Java&#39;s a fantastice language. And most languages should be lucky to have gotten to Java&#39;s ripe old age with as few idiosyncratic syntax oddities as it has!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: And what would your one change to Spring or Spring Boot be?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Long</b>: This is a tough one! I wish we could bring back and renew Spring Rich, a now long-since defunct framework for building desktop Swing-powered client applications. Griffon is the only thing that addresses this space. It&#39;s a shame, because Spring could be great here, especially now that it has deeply integrated GraalVM Native Image support. Admittedly, this is probably a niche use case, too :) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>InfoQ: Josh, thank you for this interview.</b></p>

				<p>The concept behind frameworks and libraries is to provide reusable code that you can use to perform everyday tasks so that developers don’t have to write all of the code from scratch for every project.</p>
<p>Frameworks and libraries are designed to be modular and reusable, meaning they can be used in multiple projects without needing to rewrite the code. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort and also help to improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.</p>
<p>In addition to providing reusable code, frameworks and libraries can offer a set of best practices and conventions for structuring and organizing code, which can help developers build more scalable and maintainable applications.</p>
<p>However, there are some differences that you need to understand as you start writing code, which I will cover in this article.</p>
<h2>Libraries and frameworks: Basics</h2>
<p>A library is a group of operations that programmers can call at a whim and still have complete control over the software application’s flow. The actions that libraries are expected to take are stated carefully and precisely.</p>
<p>An application describes the substance of the action by requesting the developer to fill in the blanks in a framework, which is a structure. The developer specifies the functionality with the end-user in mind, while a framework establishes the notion using a set of libraries or tools to accomplish the task.</p>
<p><strong>What are libraries?</strong></p>
<p>A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks. Libraries are often used to reduce the amount of code a programmer needs to write by providing reusable functions or classes that can be called upon as needed.</p>
<p>All libraries are shared into two classifications. All libraries are either Static or Dynamic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27133/dynamic-library%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=A%20dynamic%20library%20is%20a,performance%20for%20reduced%20memory%20consumption.%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Dynamic libraries</a></strong>: Dynamic libraries are loaded at runtime rather than linked with a program at compile time. This allows programs to use the library without having to be re-compiled if the library is updated. In addition, dynamic libraries are often used to provide platform-specific functionality or to allow multiple programs to share a single copy of the library in memory.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27132/static-library%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Static libraries</a></strong>: These are compiled into a program’s executable code, making it self-contained and independent of external changes. Static libraries are linked with a program at compile time, resulting in a single executable file that includes all of the code from the library. As a result, static libraries are often used to improve the performance of a program by avoiding the overhead of loading a library at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can write libraries in most programming languages, and they can be used by programs written in that same language or a different language. For example, a library written in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">C++</a> could be used by a program written in <a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Python</a>.</p>
<p>While there are two main classifications of libraries, there are many different types of libraries, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://devopedia.org/standard-library%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Standard libraries</a></strong>: These are libraries that are included with a programming language by default. These libraries provide a set of standard functions and utilities that are useful for many applications. For example, the <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/library-function%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">C standard library</a> includes functions for input/output, string manipulation, memory allocation, and mathematical operations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/third-party-libraries%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Third-party libraries</a></strong>: These libraries are developed by organizations or individuals other than the creators of the programming language. These libraries can provide additional functionality that is not included in the standard library and may be distributed as open-source or commercial products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Libraries can perform various tasks, such as file input and output, data manipulation, network communication, and more. They can also provide access to system resources, such as the file system or hardware devices.</p>
<h2>What are Frameworks?</h2>
<p>A framework is a set of libraries or tools that provide a structure for building applications. It typically includes <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/code-library%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">code libraries</a>, templates, and guidelines for how to use the libraries to develop applications.</p>
<p>Frameworks can be useful for developers because they provide a standardized way to build and organize code, which can help streamline the development process and make it easier to build and maintain complex applications. They can also help developers to build applications that are more reliable and scalable, as the framework provides a set of best practices and conventions to follow.</p>
<p>Frameworks are used in various programming sectors like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web development: This employs a variety of languages, including <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">JavaScript</a> (Angular), <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Python</a> (<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Django</a>), and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">PHP</a> (<a href="https://codeigniter.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">CodeIgniter</a>, <a href="https://laravel.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Laravel</a>).</li>
<li>Popular artificial intelligence frameworks include <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Tensorflow</a>, <a href="http://accord-framework.net/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Accord.Net</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Development of mobile apps: <a href="https://nativescript.org/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Native Script</a>, <a href="https://reactnative.dev/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">React Native</a>, and <a href="https://flutter.dev/?gclid=CjwKCAiAkrWdBhBkEiwAZ9cdcJNT4dBf24xvpUlbQd2qQgCfDZXczwqFJVrCiqQnJTNBlSyADf8lvxoCyMMQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Flutter</a> is a few of the well-liked frameworks. </li>
</ul>
<p>These are many different types of frameworks available, ranging from web application frameworks to game development frameworks to mobile application frameworks. Some examples of popular frameworks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, a web application framework for the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Ruby programming language</a></li>
<li><a href="https://angular.io/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Angular</a>, a JavaScript framework for building single-page web applications</li>
<li><a href="https://unity.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Unity</a>, a game development engine for building 2D and 3D games</li>
</ul>
<p>Each framework has its own set of features and capabilities, and developers can choose the one that best meets their needs for a particular project.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Libraries and Frameworks</h2>
<p>When choosing between frameworks and libraries, it is important to take into account all of their possibilities, advantages, and disadvantages.</p>
<h3>Pros of libraries</h3>
<p>There are several benefits to using programming libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Programming libraries allow you to reuse code that has already been written and tested, saving you time and effort. This means you don’t have to reinvent the wheel whenever you want to perform a common task.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong>: Programming libraries are typically well-tested and debugged, so you can be confident that the code is reliable and will work as intended.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Programming libraries can make maintaining your code easier over time. Since the library code is separate from your code, you can update or upgrade the library without affecting your codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Community support</strong>: Many popular programming libraries have large user bases and active communities, so you can often find help or resources online if you have questions or run into issues.</li>
<li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Programming libraries help ensure that your code is consistent and follows established best practices. This can make it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code.</li>
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Ignores global state management issues like HTTP and routing in favor of concentrating directly on the functionality that the library implements.</li>
<li><strong>Developer time:</strong> Lowers the cost of developing applications by providing pre-built solutions to handle random tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons of libraries</h3>
<p>There are equally some potential drawbacks to using programming libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: Using programming libraries can introduce dependencies into your codebase. This means that if the library changes or is no longer supported, it could break your code or require you to make changes. This is particularly a problem with dynamic libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Bloat</strong>: Depending on the size and complexity of the library, it could add unnecessary bloat to your codebase, which could impact the performance of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Not all libraries are compatible with all programming languages or platforms. This means you may have to choose a different library or find a way to make it work with your technology stack.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of control</strong>: When you use a programming library, you have to rely on its functionality. This means you may have less control over how a particular task is performed than writing your code from scratch.</li>
<li><strong>Learning curve</strong>: Using a new programming library can take time to learn and understand. This can be a barrier for some developers, especially if the library has a steep learning curve or needs better documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: A <a href="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/what-is-a-wrapper/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">wrapper</a> is required when using a library in an unsupported environment, which slows the application.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros of Frameworks</h2>
<p>There are several benefits to using frameworks in programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure and organization</strong>: Frameworks provide structure and organization for your code, making it easier to develop and maintain common types of applications by bringing together the libraries and tools needed. This can be especially helpful for large or complex projects.</li>
<li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Frameworks often include reusable components or libraries that can save you time and effort. This means you can write less code from scratch and offers quicker solutions for web development.</li>
<li><strong>Best practices</strong>: Frameworks often embody established best practices and design patterns, which can help ensure that your code is well-designed and maintainable.</li>
<li><strong>Community support</strong>: Many popular frameworks have large user bases and active communities, so you can often find help or resources online if you have questions or run into issues.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Frameworks are often designed with scalability in mind, which means they can handle large requests or traffic without performance issues. This can be especially important for applications that are expected to grow or have high usage levels.</li>
<li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The entire application is unaffected by a change to a single component.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Encourages the development of cross-platform applications.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong>: Creates rich, <a href="https://www.omniconvert.com/what-is/dynamic-content/%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=Dynamic%20content%20(aka%20adaptive%20content,a%20user%20requests%20a%20page.%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">dynamic content</a> that offers a better user experience with less skill required.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/data-binding%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Data binding</a>: Because several JavaScript frameworks, like Angular, are built on a common architectural pattern called <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mvc_framework/mvc_framework_introduction.htm%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">MVC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of frameworks</h2>
<p>There are a few potential drawbacks to using frameworks in programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Some frameworks can be complex and have a steep learning curve, which can be intimidating for beginner developers.</li>
<li><strong>Limited flexibility</strong>: Frameworks often have a specific way of doing things, which can be inflexible if you want to do something outside the framework’s scope. Also, a framework’s ready-to-use features restrict programmers from fully knowing the programming language.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/23591/how-do-people-measure-performance-overhead%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Performance overhead</a></strong>: Some frameworks can add a performance overhead, which can impact the speed of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency on the framework</strong>: If you build your application using a specific framework, you may become reliant on it, making it more challenging to switch to a different one.</li>
<li><strong>Lock-in</strong>: Using a framework can also lead to lock-in, where you are tied to a specific set of technologies and unable to switch to alternatives easily.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: For example. in MVC, separating the presentation layer from the business logic might be challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Only a browser environment that supports JavaScript can use JavaScript frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Unexpected consequences</strong>: As an example, if recommended framework guideline is not followed while developing, there is a chance of a security breach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Libraries and frameworks: Similarities and differences</h2>
<p>Libraries offer pre-set functions and classes to developers to streamline their work and speed up the development process. Contrarily, a framework is akin to the base upon which programmers create apps for specific platforms.</p>
<p>Both libraries and frameworks are collections of pre-written code that developers can utilize to speed up the creation of software programs. In addition, they offer several classes or functions that can carry out typical activities, such as communicating with databases, managing user input, or producing graphics.</p>
<h3>Similarities</h3>
<p>There are several similarities between libraries and frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both libraries and frameworks provide functions or classes that developers can use to perform everyday tasks.</li>
<li>Both libraries and frameworks are designed to be reusable, so developers do not have to write the same code repeatedly.</li>
<li>The process for installing libraries and frameworks is the same (e.g, installing the <a href="https://numpy.org/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Numpy</a> library and the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> framework on a computer can both be done using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">pip package installer</a> by running the command “<code>pip install numpy</code>” and “<code>pip install tensorflow</code>“, respectively, in the command line. The process for installing the library and the framework is the same, as both are done using the same package installer and the same type of command.). </li>
<li>Both libraries and frameworks can save time and effort when building software applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to illustrate the similarities between libraries and frameworks is with an example. Suppose you are building a web application that needs to authenticate users and allow them to upload and download files. You can use multiple libraries or a more complete framework to provide the necessary functionality for these tasks.</p>
<p>For example, you could use a library like “<a href="https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Authlib</a>” to handle <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/user-authentication%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=User%20authentication%20verifies%20the%20identity,to%20confirm%20a%20user&#39;s%20authenticity.%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">user authentication</a>. This library provides a set of functions you can call in your code to handle tasks such as creating new user accounts, logging in and out, and verifying user credentials. Then get a different library for handling file transfers, or write your own.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could use a framework like “<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Django</a>” to handle both user authentication and file uploads/downloads. Django is a full-stack web framework with many out-of-the-box functionalities, including user authentication and file storage. When using Django, you would write your code within the structure provided by the framework, following its conventions and patterns.</p>
<p>Both libraries and frameworks can be valuable tools for building software applications, and the choice of which to use will depend on the specific needs of your project. However, both libraries and frameworks provide pre-written code that can save time and effort when building software, and they can be easily installed and used in a project.</p>
<h2>Differences</h2>
<p>These are some key differences between libraries and frameworks which I will discuss further in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>Libraries are designed to be flexible and can be used in various ways. Developers can choose how to use a library and incorporate it into their code in any way that makes sense for their project. </p>
<p>Consider the mathematical library.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how a mathematical library can be used in a simple mathematical operation, using the Math library in Python:</p>


		<div id="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-653bb45bd1008773102735" data-settings=" minimize scroll-always">

					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>


<p>In this example, the Math library provides functions for performing various mathematical operations, such as calculating square roots, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. The developers can use these functions in any way they see fit. They can call any of the functions provided by the library and use the return values of these functions in any way they like. Hence, this example showcases the flexibility of a library.</p>
<p>In contrast to libraries, frameworks tend to impose a specific structure or pattern on the principle that the developer writes. This means that developers must follow the system set by the framework when using it.</p>
<p>Now consider a framework like “<a href="https://rubyonrails.org/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Rails</a>.” Rails is a web application framework that provides a range of functionality for building web applications, including routing, database interaction, and rendering views. When using Rails, a developer must follow the structure and conventions of the framework. For example, they might write code like this:</p>


		<div id="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-653bb45bd1013259750394" data-settings=" minimize scroll-always">
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>class</span><span> </span><span>UsersController</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>ApplicationController</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>show</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>@</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:</span><span>id</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>end</span></p><p><span>end</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>


<p>In this example, the developer must define a controller class that inherits from “<code>ApplicationController</code>” and define a “show” action within that class. They must also use instance variables (such as @user) in a specific way, as they will be used to render views.</p>
<h3>Inversion of control</h3>
<p>This has a vital difference in libraries and frameworks. It refers to managing control flow in an application that uses a library or framework. In a standard library, the developer writes code that calls the library’s functions or methods. The developer controls the program’s flow and can decide when to call the library’s functions. This is known as “procedural control.”</p>
<p>This example reflects procedural control in a library:</p>


		<div id="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-653bb45bd1015758060605" data-settings=" minimize scroll-always">
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p>#<span> </span><span>Import</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>library</span></p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>authlib</span></p><p>#<span> </span><span>Use</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>library</span><span>&#39;s functions to perform tasks</span></p><p><span>user = authlib.create_user(username=&#39;</span><span>jane</span><span>&#39;, password=&#39;</span><span>123456</span><span>&#39;)</span></p><p><span>authlib.login(username=&#39;</span><span>jane</span><span>&#39;, password=&#39;</span><span>123456</span>&#39;<span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>


<p>In contrast, in a framework, the framework calls the code that the developer writes. The developer writes code that conforms to the structure and conventions of the framework, and the framework calls this code at specific points in the application’s execution. This is known as “inversion of control.”</p>


		<div id="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-653bb45bd1016594178549" data-settings=" minimize scroll-always">
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>Here</span><span> </span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>an</span><span> </span><span>example</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>inversion</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>control</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>framework</span><span>:</span></p><p>#<span> </span><span>Import</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>framework</span></p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Django</span></p><p>#<span> </span><span>Use</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>framework</span><span>&#39;s structure to build the application</span></p><p><span># Define a Django &#34;view&#34; function to handle a request</span></p><p><span>def handle_request(request):</span></p><p><span>  # Perform some action based on the request</span></p><p><span>  ...</span></p><p><span># Define a Django &#34;urlpattern&#34; to map the view function to a URL</span></p><p><span>urlpatterns = [</span></p><p><span>  path(&#39;</span><span>/</span>&#39;<span>,</span><span> </span><span>handle_request</span><span>)</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>]</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>


<p>In this example, the developer has defined a “view” function called handle_request that Django will contact to handle incoming HTTP requests. The developer has written this function within the structure provided by the Django framework, and the framework will call the function at the appropriate time when a request is received. This represents an inversion of control, as the framework calls the code that the developer has written rather than the other way around.</p>
<h3><strong>Scope of functionality</strong></h3>
<p>The scope of functionality refers to the range of tasks that a library or framework is designed to handle. Libraries are focused on a specific task or set of tasks and provide a narrow range of functionality that can be used to perform these tasks. For example, a library might be designed to handle user input, interact with a database, or perform data parsing.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how a library might be used in code to handle user input:</p>


		<div id="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-653bb45bd1017318113637" data-settings=" minimize scroll-always">
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p>#<span> </span><span>Import</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>library</span></p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>inputlib</span></p><p>#<span> </span><span>Use</span><span> </span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>library</span><span>&#39;s functions to handle user input</span></p><p><span>name = inputlib.get_string(&#39;</span><span>Enter</span><span> </span><span>your</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span>&#39;)</span></p><p><span>age = inputlib.get_int(&#39;</span><span>Enter</span><span> </span><span>your</span><span> </span><span>age</span><span>:</span>&#39;<span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>


<p>In contrast, frameworks are designed to provide a wide range of functionality and are often used to build complete applications. A framework will typically include a set of libraries and other tools that can perform a wide range of tasks, such as handling user input, rendering graphics, and interacting with a database.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how a framework might be used in code to build a complete web application:</p>


		<div id="urvanov-syntax-highlighter-653bb45bd1018207374580" data-settings=" minimize scroll-always">

<p>Here, the developer is using Django to build a complete web application. The developer has defined a “view” function to handle incoming HTTP requests and has used Django’s built-in libraries to define a model for storing user data in a database. This demonstrates a framework’s broad scope of functionality, including tools for handling user input, interacting with a database, and building a complete web application.</p>
<h3><strong>Ease of use</strong></h3>
<p>Libraries are generally easier to use than frameworks, as impose far less specific structure or pattern on the code written by the developer. This can make them more flexible and easier to work with, especially for developers who are new to a particular language or platform.</p>
<h2>Is it wrong to use Libraries and Frameworks interchangeably?</h2>
<p>Although they have similarities, developers shouldn’t confuse libraries for frameworks or use both terms interchangeably. </p>
<p>Understanding the distinction will make it easier for you to make sense of all the resources that are already accessible for web application development and all the ones that will undoubtedly emerge in the future.</p>
<p>You can also combine different resources in the same application by knowing whether each is a framework or a library. Can you combine, for instance, Angular and Express? React and Rails? React and Angular? Express and Rails?</p>
<p>Some of these tools are frontend or backend intended and you can only combine them if you follow the guide below… </p>
<h2>Mixing Frameworks</h2>
<p>Typically, you wouldn’t combine two frameworks, especially that have overlapping purposes, but there are common reasons why you might.</p>
<ul>
<li>The “MEAN” stack (Express and Angular) is an exception to the rule , because both frameworks are lightweight and concentrate on different aspects of the application.</li>
<li>Although one is a framework and the other is a library, Angular and React offer front-end rendering paradigms. Thus, combining the two generally wouldn’t make sense.</li>
<li>Since one is a robust framework for full-stack apps and the other is a library for front-end rendering, you can combine Rails and React. </li>
<li>However, since Rails and Express offer back-end framewor ks, you shouldn’t combine the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you may (and typically must) incorporate a framework and a library. Furthermore, you usually need to integrate your framework with many libraries because each library excels at doing one particular task, and applications frequently employ a variety of libraries because they must perform various tasks efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>An application can be quickly developed and deployed using a framework. By utilizing a framework, we may use resources to expedite the development and improve user experience. A library is used to increase an application’s functionality. We can use the functions from our library in a variety of applications.</p>
<p>Who controls the execution flow is the key technical distinction between a framework and a library. You decide when to call the library, if at all when using a library. However, while using a framework, you write code to fill in the framework’s gaps because the framework manages the execution flow. The code that’s written is called the framework.</p>
