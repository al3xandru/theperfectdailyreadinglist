Every so often, a near past style was frozen and called a genre, you could call it a major version. Once the jazz as most people know it was part of a movement pushing those boundaries, but so was debussy, chopin, or almost any other composer. Now, this jazz has little freedom and has more in common with classical music, as most boundaries of the genre are fixed. Of course  other jazz is still pushing, and because of that it is a less clear defined part of the genre.<p>My personal favorite is Keith Jarrett, clearly owing to Monk, with the Tokyo concert. His Koln concert is better known, and less avant guarde, the Tokio requires full attention from the listener.</p><p>I like the articles focus on a single person, as jazz itself grew so wide it is hard to say anything about it. The concept jazz can be better understood by learning about the individual concrete parts of it, rather than sweeping generalizations.

                  <p><span>Yes and how people talk about hip hop in our era is how people talked about jazz in an earlier one. Mainstream audiences and white critics <i>hated</i> it for a long time, dismissed it as unserious or unmusical. A lot of that dynamic is paved over by its later prestige and unmistakable role as a cultural force. But a lot of the people who hate hip hop would have hated jazz too, if they had lived contemporaneous with its rise.</span></p></div></td></tr>

It is literally a jazz piece, used as backing for a very lyrical rap. A jazz piece even, that already solidified in the jazz era of the early 20th century. Musically Kendricks track pushes no boundaries and is an easily recognized style that exists for almost a century.<p>Of course Kendricks work is pushing boundaries. He has an excellent produced voice, the rap a timbre and meter that is fresh. These are musical components of his words, but mere details in all the music in this track. However, the words in his rap are not details.</p><p>Personally I have never been into words in music. I barely could hear them growing up listening to metal, and still only register a phrase or two in music today. If you see music and lyrics as different things, I see how you would give rap a bad rap, musically speaking.</p><p>My current fav (I can only  understand every fifth word obviously): <a href="https://soundcloud.com/icespiceee/ice-spice-no-clarity" rel="nofollow">https://soundcloud.com/icespiceee/ice-spice-no-clarity</a>

When I hear something I like, I add it to a playlist. I&#39;m planning to do the same with Downbeat&#39;s readers poll[2] and, now that I&#39;ve seen it, with the Jazzwise list linked by parent.</p><p>I also go to my local jazz club about once a month.

And you hear that same segment repeated three times before the tune is done. That&#39;s a lot of repeated b-flats.</p><p>Like any jazz player, Monk plays that tune at the beginning. Then it&#39;s the part of jazz where he&#39;s supposed to solo-- that is, show his prowess at improvising and creating new melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. To do so, he... just keeps hammering those fucking b-flats! I mean there are other little flourishes and ideas in there, but he <i>always</i> comes back to those incessant b-flats.</p><p>To top it all off, he gives both a four-bar intro and four-bar outro with... guess what? Yep, the b-flats. And he <i>drags</i> over them every time, giving each one plenty of time and volume. There may be other artists from the time who played slower than Monk, but Monk <i>feels</i> slower than any other jazz artist I know.</p><p>I think a lot of the praise his contemporaries heaped on him was revisionist. We know Miles Davis initially found his comping distracting. I&#39;d bet there were <i>a lot</i> more who thought he was essentially &#34;doing jazz wrong,&#34; but they couldn&#39;t easily dismiss him because he could obviously swing. Just listen to his surprise acceleration 19 seconds in to &#34;Don&#39;t Mean a Thing&#34; above. He doesn&#39;t even retain the &#34;correct&#34; number of measures for that part. Who else was doing stuff like that at the time? Art Tatum is the only one who comes to mind, and he was usually playing solo piano.</p><p>Edit: Oops, that&#39;s actually the record skipping! Hehe. But I also noticed that after a few choruses the repeated b-flats start to <i>infect</i> the other part of the phrase and take it over, so there&#39;s that. (And regardless, Art Tatum <i>did</i> actually do jump cuts like this in his own playing. There&#39;s even a recording of him playing a Chopin waltz where he takes that technique to an extreme.)</p><p>It&#39;s as if Monk was &#34;wrong warping&#34; through jazz. The only comparable thing I can think of was Debussy internalizing Wagner&#39;s mature operas and then writing What-Would-Wagner-Not-Do tone poems and character pieces. And unlike, say, a Brahms or a Coltrane-- whose styles typically featured long chains of continual development that left us with clear proof of their compositional work-- Debussy and Monk have a lot of output where there&#39;s often <i>nearly nothing there</i>.</p><p>It&#39;s very difficult to write like that without either falling into incoherence, or convincing your contemporaries that there&#39;s something wrong with you.</p><p>But then it&#39;s dangerous to try to point out <i>exactly</i> what Monk was doing wrong-- after all, one could end up accidentally revealing one&#39;s own confirmation biases and assumptions that hamper one&#39;s own creativity. Hence, the Diogenes comparison.

Miles paused for a long time, then he said I love those old tunes but they&#39;re in the past and I can&#39;t go back there. I got to keep moving.<p>I really respected him for that, but when I got to college the music program was so focused on the past. It looked like the only prof who was doing contemporary stuff was the percussion guy and I played trumpet. I got booed out of the room once for suggesting it&#39;d be cool to mix jazz and hip-hop (this was 1989).</p><p>If I&#39;d stuck with it I probably would have discovered all kinds of new stuff going on, but I followed what Miles said and got into electronic music.

Teachers don&#39;t know what the new stuff is, how could they teach it :-)</p><p>I took organ lessons from an established jazz-pianist as a teenager. I was an all time beginner but he got his job  from a music store where we bought the electric organ, so he couldn&#39;t choose his students. :-)</p><p>He made me practice old pop tunes like &#34;Moon River&#34; I remember. I told him I&#39;m getting tired of this crap I don&#39;t like these oldies but goldies. Why can&#39;t you teach me jazz or rock or something cool. He told me listen, maybe you don&#39;t like these songs, or maybe you don&#39;t like the way you play them.  Then he played it and dropped in some cool jazz chords and syncopation. I was amazed and inspired. I realized I couldn&#39;t do what he did unless I learned to play the song the old way first.
