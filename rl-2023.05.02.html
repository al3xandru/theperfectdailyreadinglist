Reading the thought-provoking &#34;<a href="https://without.boats/blog/patterns-and-abstractions/">Patterns &amp;
Abstractions</a>&#34; post reminded me of a long-held opinion I have about
programming language design: we have a tendency to keep adding
features to a language until it becomes so big <span>[1]</span>
that its sheer size makes it difficult to use reliably. Since most of us
spend most of our time programming in one language, it can be difficult
to see a common trend amongst languages in general.


</p><h2>Language size over time</h2>
<p>Let me start with a concrete example. I started using Python around version
1.3, though the first version I really remember was 1.4 <span>[2]</span>. Python 1.5 was a real improvement, adding the <code>assert</code>
statement, nested packages (&#34;hierarchical modules&#34; in the release notes), and
the <code>re</code> regular expression module — things that I suspect
nearly every modern Python programmer finds useful. At that point, Python was
still a relatively small language, to the extent that you could reasonably
expect to store nearly every detail about it (and its implementation!) in your
head.

</p><p>Python 1.6 added support for unicode — support that was clearly
useful, but which turned out to be sufficiently awkward that (somewhat) fixing
that awkwardness turned out to be a major cause underlying the schism between
Python 2 and 3. As Python 1.6 turned to 2.0 and beyond, this formerly small
language kept adding features, many of which I find useful (e.g. list
comprehensions), but each of which has inevitably made the language bigger.

</p><p>In retrospect, Python 1.5 was probably the last version of Python that
someone with my limited brainpower could reasonably expect to fully understand.
By the time of Python 2.7, Python was definitely a big language, and it has
only grown in size since then. I doubt there are many people who could claim
they understood every detail of Python 2.7, and there is probably no one who
claims that of recent versions of Python 3.


</p><h2>The criteria for language features</h2>
<p>How did Python become a big language? The initial version of Python
was small, and the first several versions deliberately tried to maintain
that smallness: most feature suggestions were explicitly rejected on the
grounds that they would make the language too big. At some point (perhaps
between Python 1.6 and Python 2.0?) it seemed to me that something changed:
features were not rejected solely on the grounds of making the language too
big, but on the grounds that they didn&#39;t fix an important enough problem.

</p><p>The difference between these two criteria might seem minor, but &#34;reject a
design if it doesn&#39;t solve an important problem&#34; implicitly downgrades the size
of the language as a concern in and of itself. As soon as a language&#39;s
designers stop worrying about the size of the language, it seems inevitable to
me that the language will grow almost without bound. Certainly, Python
looks set to keep on adding new features.

</p><p>Although I&#39;ve used Python as an example, I could have chosen many other
languages. For example, although Java was never what I&#39;d call a small
language, it had many years of fairly minor language changes before adding
generics to Java 1.5 — that seemed to be the point at which
Java began its journey to the large language it now is. Haskell started
off as a fairly small ML-inspired language, but is now a very large language
(albeit one can opt-in or out from many features in the standard compiler).
JavaScript has gone from a long-weekend design to a rather large
language. I know a lot less about languages like C# and the like, but I
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they&#39;ve gone, or are going, through something similar.

</p><p>These days I do most of my programming at Rust, a language which
is already big, but which is perhaps now being forced to think about whether
it wants to become very big or not. For example, if preventing Rust
getting too big is a goal, it&#39;s hard to imagine the recently proposed <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/02/23/keyword-generics-progress-report-feb-2023.html">keyword
generics initiative</a> being accepted, even though it clearly solves a
problem. On the other hand, Rust has already added dedicated support
for async/await, so is it a good idea to cleave the library system in two?
Whatever the outcome is, some people will be unhappy — these
decisions aren&#39;t easy!

</p><p>Why does this happen? Well, no programming language is perfect: there are
always use cases it doesn&#39;t support well. In many cases, growing the language
in size helps it better support those use cases better. Since there are an
unbounded number of potential use cases, there is thus always &#34;more&#34; language
design that we can do, each time making the language a little bigger. As
<a href="https://without.boats/blog/patterns-and-abstractions/">Patterns &amp;
Abstractions</a> points out, one continual temptation is to move
&#34;patterns&#34; (i.e. standard idioms of use) to &#34;abstractions&#34; (i.e. language
features). There are advantages to such moves: languages can, for
example, give better error messages and better optimise &#34;abstractions&#34;. But
there is also a cost: patterns do not affect a language&#39;s size, but abstractions
do. Only some user&#39;s of a language will encounter a given pattern, but nearly
every user is at some point confronted by nearly every abstraction. This
quote from Bjarne Stroustrup in a <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/how-to-write-a-proposal.pdf">1992 document on
suggested C++ extensions</a> is relevant to many languages:

</p><blockquote>
Please also understand that there are dozens of reasonable extensions and
changes being proposed. If every extension that is reasonably well-defined,
clean and general, and would make life easier for a couple of hundred or couple
of thousand C++ programmers were accepted, the language would more than double
in size. We do not think this would be an advantage to the C++ community.
</blockquote>
<h2>Must all languages grow in size?</h2><p>

There are some interesting exceptions to the trend of languages growing over time.

</p><p>Lisp-based languages, particularly those in the Scheme tradition, tend to
maintain fairly small language cores. However, because of the extensive use of
macros, it&#39;s sometimes difficult to know how to classify &#34;language size&#34; in
such languages. I&#39;m far too out of date with, say, modern Racket to have an
informed opinion on its size.

</p><p>Lua was, and is, a small language — and, probably not
coincidentally, so is its implementation. Interestingly, as far as I have been able
to tell, one of the ways Lua&#39;s designers have kept the language evolving is to
regularly force (generally small) breaking changes on its user base. It&#39;s an
interesting trade-off, and not one that has been taken by any other language
that I can think of.

</p><p>Perhaps the best known (partial) exception is C. Modern C is a surprisingly
different language to the original C, but that evolution happens
rather slowly these days, with new versions of the C standard coming out around every 8-12
years. Each new versions tends to add few new language features, or even
standard functions, and tends to put at least as much effort into clarifying
parts of the language&#39;s semantics that have either always been unclear or which
have been rendered unclear by new hardware (see <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2023/why_arent_programming_language_specifications_comprehensive.html">Why
Aren&#39;t Programming Language Specifications Comprehensive?</a> for some
examples).

</p><p>My impression of C, as someone from the outside occasionally looking in, is
that those responsible for the C language standard probably consider
themselves to be more &#34;maintainers&#34; than &#34;designers&#34;: they want C to be a
useful language in the modern world, but they also clearly want to balance
that with not letting C grow too much bigger.

</p><p>One advantage C has is, ironically, C++: anyone who
wants &#34;C but with lots of new features&#34; can be told to go and use C++ instead
of growing C in size. Although it&#39;s difficult to distinguish cause from
effect, perhaps this has dissuaded those people who like adding new features
to languages from considering proposing them for C, when C++ is likely to be far
more receptive to their suggestions. Certainly, C++ is a huge language which keeps on
growing: Bjarne Stroustrup&#39;s recent-ish plea to &#34;<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0977r0.pdf">Remember
the Vasa</a>&#34; strikes a cautionary note that few would make about C.


</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>

Language designers face challenging trade-offs. Their languages can always be
made better for more users by adding new features, but doing so makes the
language bigger. At some point, languages become big enough that few users can
understand all of the language — but nearly every user of a language will
at least occasionally encounter nearly every feature. When users encounter
features they don&#39;t understand, their reactions can vary from surprise to worry
— if they notice at all! The larger a language is, the easier it is
for users to misuse it without even knowing it.

</p><p>There is no easy way for us to to evaluate whether a new feature is
worth increasing a language&#39;s size for. It&#39;s also easier for those
people who will benefit from a feature to advocate for it than for those people
whose lives might (unwittingly) be made worse by it to advocate against it.
Even talking about &#34;size&#34; in anything other than a vague way <span>[3]</span> is hard: quantitative metrics like the size of a language&#39;s grammar or
compiler do not always correlate with the inherently qualitative measure of
&#34;cognitive load&#34; that two new features may impose on humans.

</p><p>Perhaps in an ideal world, language designers would at some point declare
their languages &#34;complete&#34;, capping the language&#39;s size. However, hardware and
other external factors change in ways that sometimes force even the most
conservative language to adapt. Even a language like C, which evolves slowly,
still evolves. And for as long as a language must evolve, it must have
designers. And for as long as a language has designers, there will always be
the temptation to add shiny new features.

</p><p>However, I think language designers can learn something useful from C&#39;s
example. While we can&#39;t declare our languages &#34;complete&#34; we can at some point
declare them to be in &#34;minimal evolution&#34; mode. This is decidedly less sexy than,
and offers fewer job opportunities to, language designers than continually adding new
features — but it also allows users to focus on the tasks they want to program,
rather than having to deal with ever more complexity. Slowly, over time, new
languages will come along which take the best ideas, simplify and unify them,
and can keep the field moving forwards. In general, in my opinion, that&#39;s
shown itself to be a more successful tactic than hoping that ever-bigger
languages can satisfy all users.

    <h3><em>Down with The Platform, up with Developer Enablement</em></h3>
  <h6>Posted on Feb  8 2023</h6>


  <p>This year (2023) is the year of platform engineering. Don’t believe me? Here is the esteemed (and it has to be said lovely) Charles Humble totally accurately quoting the ravings of some madman on twitter:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“This is going to be year of platform engineering.” <a href="https://twitter.com/samnewman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@samnewman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTFIsCloudNative?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WTFIsCloudNative</a></p>— Charles Humble (@charleshumble@mastodon.social) (@charleshumble) <a href="https://twitter.com/charleshumble/status/1621152793150226432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2023</a></blockquote>




<p>See? The industry is all ablaze about the idea. I mean, even <a href="[Gartner%20IT%20Infrastructure,%20Operations%20&amp;%20Cloud%20Strategies%20Conference%202022%20London:%20Day%201%20Highlights](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-11-21-gartner-it-infrastructure-operations-and-cloud-strategies-conference-2022-london-day-1-highlights)">Gartner</a> has come to the party, so it must be a thing, right? If Gartner says something, it <em>must</em> be true. I fully expect we&#39;ll see the announcement of PlatformCon 2023 to be held at the Moscone Center, with &#34;Con&#34; taking on many, many, meanings.</p>

<p>But, let’s pump the brakes for a bit. I fear that we’ve come too far from the original intention of a developer platform. We’re in danger of being drowned under an orgy of vendor-driven mis-direction, which will allow existing IT structures to carry on as if nothing ever happened as they can slap a new label on old practices.</p>

</figure>

<p>A cynic might argue that the (as of time of writing)  $66.8 BILLION raised to fund the Cambrian explosion of products around Kubernetes means that a lot of VCs are looking for their payday. And I suspect that much like the early days of attempts to monetise Agile, DevOps and the API Economy, the pickings have been slim. But a new term they can get behind, leaving aside the confusing term “Cloud Native”? Count them in! Marketing suddenly got a whole lot simpler.</p>

<figcaption>Are we not entertained?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The reality is, Kubernetes is everywhere, and just like every successful fungus continues to spread (I kid, I kid!).</p>

<p>Let’s get some things out of the way. Kubernetes, vanilla Kubernetes, not whatever horrific private cloud your company has cobbled together, is not in any way shape or form developer friendly. To be fair, that’s not what it was created to be. But fundamentally, the out of the box experience is fine for infrastructure automation nerds like me, but friendly for the bulk of developers? Hell no.</p>

<p>Kubernetes, again vanilla Kubernetes, not that complex expensive disappointment your CIO purchased, also doesn’t do much. At its heart, its main job is to help schedule containers. It was successful for a number of reasons. Firstly, because it has a pretty good API allowing for extensibility. Secondly, because it was competing against solutions that were by turns too expensive (PCF), confusingly complex (Mesos), or suffering an identity crisis (like Docker Swarm - I can only assume the marketing geniuses at Docker ended up in charge of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-meet-duo-video-chat-app-merger/">naming stuff at Google</a>). Thirdly, and most importantly, because a bunch of people got scared by AWS and thought backing the project might stop Amazon becoming the dominant cloud platform for deploying software. On that front, it&#39;s been a huge success, right? Right?</p>

<p>Kubernetes was extensible, and allowed an ecosystem to grow around it. It’s easy to use the CNCF landscape as a source of snark (and as you can see, I do) - but it’s a sign of success. It’s also a sign of a bewildering array of options available to anyone considering building a solution on top.</p>

<figcaption>What could possibly go wrong?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think I finally started to understand how crazy everything had got after watching this great talk from V Körbes. After watching this engaging talk, I needed a lie down. The bewildering array of options to solve the same problems can take an expert like V to navigate, was a concern to me back in 2019 when this talk was from. Since then, can anyone say it&#39;s got better?</p>

<p>So, now we have a towering edifice, created out of software which is well meaning and apparently simple in isolation, that ends up as a rube Goldberg machine of operational overhead, latency blackholes, and ever increasing budgets. The VCs are rubbing their hands, the rest of us are staring into the abyss - but this time, it&#39;s got an API.</p>

<h3 id="the-past-experience">The past experience</h3>

<p>I was far from the only person worried about the complexity of the Kubernetes ecosystem in the pre-pandemic times, in fact rather than just bitching about it down at the pub, a number of folks actually started talking about it more to try and share better ways of thinking about this space. Developer experience, typically shortened to DevEx or DX, became a hot topic for a while.</p>

<p>Although I do a lot of general vendor bashing (hey, my company has two people - I consider vendor bashing to be very much punching up!), a lot of the talk about DevEx was coming from the vendor space. People building technical developer-focused products, wanting to understand how to make their tooling easy to use and sharing tips with the wider industry.</p>

<p>Daniel Bryant from DataWire in particular was talking about these ideas back then, his talk in 2019 giving a great overview of the challenges we have to deal with.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44e_H-BURR0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Remember 2019? Simpler times. Very much pre-pandemic, and back when we thought “jeez, the whole Kubernetes ecosystem is a bit much, isn’t it?”. Here we are in 2023, and how is that going for us?</p>

<h3 id="enter-the-platform">Enter The Platform</h3>

<p>2023 is here. Developer Experience is dead, long live The Platform.</p>

<p>So now, we’ve arrived at The Platform. Note the capital ’T’ and ‘P’. This is it. The time has come. We brought all this stuff, now we have to make it work together.</p>

<p>The reality is, much of the effort around platform engineering is NOT about empowering developers, it’s about hiding the towering pile of crap we’ve assembled and now have to hide from the people we apparently got it for in the first place. It’s like buying a bunch of presents for a child, then having to hide them because they’re too dangerous for them to use, and in reality you really got them for yourself. Did your kid <em>really</em> need that compound hunting bow?</p>

<p>It’s not about the experience. It’s not about enablement. It’s about serving the idol of technology, doubling down on our sunk cost. The Platform Above All Others. It should be here to serve, but instead it ends up bending those who use it to their will.</p>

<h3 id="topologically-topical">Topologically Topical</h3>

<p>Into this morass, wades Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton, who outline a vision for modern software delivery organisations in their book <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book">Team Topologies</a>. In it, they describe long-lived stream aligned (outcome-oriented) teams who work with high degrees of autonomy. Empowered to get things done, and get software out of the door and into the hands of their customers as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book"><img src="https://samnewman.io/img/blog/2023/TeamTop_cover_RGB_flat_stroke.jpg" alt="The front cover of the Team Topologies book, written by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton, with a foreword by Ruth Malan"/></a>
</p>

<p>To support this mission, these poly-skilled teams need help. Other types of teams - enablement teams in Team Topologies speak - exist to help these teams get things done.  Functions like security, architecture, design, go from being gatekeepers to enablers - their job is to provide support to get things done.</p>

<p>In the book, the authors also make it clear that these teams need enablement in terms of the developer tooling they need too, hence the need for some sort of platform. The book positions a Platform Team as being somehow different to an enablement team, but personally I see the platform team as just another type of enablement team. The mission of the platform team, should you choose to accept it, is about enabling these stream aligned teams to get things done.</p>

<p>Above all though, as great as the content is in the book (and I highly recommend it to anyone in a leadership role in software development), I do wish they hadn’t codified the concept of the platform team. Naming is important - it pushes a direction - &#34;we exist to build a platform&#34;. But read the words of the book, and that’s not really the role they should play.</p>

<p>The book goes on to outline a vision for the ideal platform. It should be developed like a consumer-facing product. Think about customer needs. Most controversially of all, they make an argument that the platform should be optional..</p>

<p>Making the platform optional is very challenging for some people. It cost so much, we need to justify the cost. So people have to use it! Otherwise we wasted time and money. And as Matthew and Manuel point out, when something becomes mandatory, interesting thing happens, When you make people use the platform, you stop caring about making it easy to use, <em>because they don’t have a choice</em>. You aren&#39;t incentivised to improve the user experience to attract people to the platform, as they have to be there anyway.</p>

<p>Matthew, Manuel, and myself are far from the only people banging the drum for developing an internal developer platform like a consumer-driven product. Another ex-colleague of mine, Evan Bottcher, put forward a compelling vision for what a developer platform should be back in 2018 <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/talk-about-platforms.html">What I Talk About When I Talk About Platforms</a>:</p>

<p>But those of us with no products to sell don’t have the marketing budgets of those who do. Remember that $66.8 billion raised by companies on the CNCF landscape? That money doesn’t just go into building the stuff. Pushing back against the weight of money in this space with this blog post is a bit like trying to stop a tornado with a kazoo. It’s not very effective, but at least I enjoy the funny sounds it makes.</p>

<p>The vision for The Platform has gone from being a vision for a better experience for developers, where the platform exists to serve developers, and has instead come to serve the Kult Of Kubernetes, and it&#39;s worshipers.</p>

<h3 id="whats-in-a-name">What&#39;s In A Name?</h3>

<p>Whenever you come across a team which is named after a specific tool or technology, you have a potential problem. The API Gateway Team. The Enterprise Service Bus Team. And yes, The Platform Team.</p>

<p>The problems occur on two fronts. Firstly, for &#34;technical&#34; single-issue teams like this, they become the bottleneck, the silo. They end up owning key technical infrastructure, in much the same way as a dragon hordes its gold. Making changes to these pieces of key infrastructure to suit the needs of the developers that use them can often be like getting Gollum to share the ring, if Gollum used Jira.</p>

<figcaption>My Precious, etc.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a more subtle concern with single-issue teams like this though. It speaks to confused motivations, a lack of focus. Their job becomes about managing the tool. Are they ever going to be in a position to think about alternatives? To realise a better way to solve the problems at hand? These are teams where they have only one tool, one hammer - and all problems better be a nail. Or else.</p>

<p>An old colleague of mine succinctly differentiated the two world views at play. Sriram Narayan described <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html">ActivityOriented</a> teams as  those driven to carry out a certain activity:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html">
“... activity-oriented teams are prone to optimize for their own activity and not for the bigger picture of delivering useful software. This is a consequence of what they are held responsible for and how they are measured. It is common for a team of only developers to only be measured by their velocity. If they are only tasked with delivering scope, they will not think about whether it is going to solve the problems it was meant to.“

- <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html">Sriram Narayan</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Sriram suggests instead that the solution to this is to instead think in terms of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html">OutcomeOriented</a> teams, where teams are focused on delivering an outcome, rather than slavishly locked into a certain implementation detail.</p>

<p>We want our Platform Team to be about outcomes - but we are hamstringing them from the beginning by calling the Platform Team in the first place, and worse could follow by codifying &#34;Platform Engineering&#34; as a thing.</p>

<p>Naming things is important. For a team inside an organisation, it can change how you are viewed, and what people expect you to be able to offer. For people in the team itself, it&#39;s one of the simpler ways you can help set direction - rightly or wrong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for these reasons that I argue we should name the team after the outcomes we wanted them to achieve, rather than in terms of a technical solution they might want to use. Quite aside from the fact that you might need more than one platform (so Platform Team has to become Platforms Team?), often the best way to improve the experience of developers may have nothing to do with a platform in the first place. Better names might be “Delivery Support” or even better “Delivery Enablement”.</p>

<p>A platform <em>might</em> be the best way to reduce the cognitive burden on developers and allow them to get more done, but at best it is a means to an end. But we need to encourage people in charge of this function to be able to think more broadly. Matthew Skelton:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if the most important part of &#34;platform engineering&#34; is maintaining a high quality wiki with proven, empathic patterns for Stream-aligned teams to follow? 📄 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/platformengineering?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#platformengineering</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevOps?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DevOps</a></p>— Matthew Skelton #BLM 💙🌻 (@matthewpskelton) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton/status/1581191123300913152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote>


<p>If you&#39;re a team who cares about empowering developers, you&#39;ll think about offering training, doing outreach, embedding yourself in delivery teams to help them use the tools and also get feedback on if the solutions you are offering are appropriate. All of those things seem like they&#39;d be the responsibility of the Delivery Enablement team, don&#39;t they? The Platform Team though? Sorry, I&#39;ve got a Kubernetes cluster to polish.</p>

<p>Just as with DevOps (It&#39;s The Culture, Stupid!) we&#39;re in danger of missing the point all over again.</p>

<h3 id="so-what">So What?</h3>

<p>When writing the 2nd edition of Building Microservices, I revisited the concept of habitability - a concept which I visit in the context of developer platforms <a href="https://samnewman.io/talks/pump-it-up/">in a talk last year</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDSMDJXmOps" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Habitability, in the broadest sense, describes how nice (or not) the experience is for the people who have to live in a system. From a building, to a codebase, to the ecosystem of developer tools we deliver for our workforce. In the talk, and in my most recent book, I make the argument that we ignore habitability at our peril. Those of us in a place to shape the lived experiences of our colleagues have a duty of care to ensure that we take their needs to heart.</p>

<p>Delivering a habitable experience requires empathy for the people that will live and work there. Having a clear focus, and vision, for the people who are responsible for this is much more important than any particular technology.</p>

<p>And so, I come back once again, to the name. If we want to have a hope of coming out the other side with a better lived experience for our delivery teams, I urge you to consider making at least one small change inside your own organisation.</p>

<p>No more platform team. Kubernetes, containers, the cloud, the platform - it’s all means to an end. Down with The Platform, up with Developer Enablement.</p>

<p><strong>Stoic serenity</strong></p>
<p>&#34;Stay calm and serene regardless of what life throws at you,&#34; advised the Roman philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Sounds easier said than done, you would think. But in fact, the Stoic Aurelius had a knack for making calmness seem easy to achieve. </p></div></div><div id="culture/article/20230120-five-ways-to-be-calm-and-why-it-matters-p0dxdcx3"><picture><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0dxdcx3.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0dxdcx3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0dxdcx3.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0dxdcx3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdcx3.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdcx3.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="The philosopher Epictetus and other Stoics believed that finding calm was essential – and within our control (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdcx3.jpg" alt="The philosopher Epictetus and other Stoics believed that finding calm was essential – and within our control (Credit: Alamy)" id=""/></picture><div><p>The philosopher Epictetus and other Stoics believed that finding calm was essential – and within our control (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p>Aurelius&#39;s famous work <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/35489/meditations-by-marcus-aurelius-edited-and-trans-by--martin-hammond-intro--diskin-clay/9780141395869">Meditations</a> is, according to John Sellars – <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/312681/lessons-in-stoicism-by-sellars-john/9780141990040">author</a> and Reader at <a href="https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/">Royal Holloway</a>, University of London –  all about &#34;putting our everyday cares and concerns into wider perspective&#34;. As emperor of Rome, Aurelius faced huge pressures but, Sellars tells BBC Culture: &#34;He often reminds himself how brief his life is compared to the vastness of time, and how small it is compared to the whole of the cosmos.&#34;</p>
<p>In line with his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200930-why-embracing-change-is-the-key-to-a-good-life">Stoic life view</a>, Aurelius also reminds himself constantly that &#34;whatever frustration or negative emotions he might be feeling are ultimately the product of his own judgments or interpretations about situations, and so, as a consequence, things within his power to control,&#34; says Sellars. </p></div><div><blockquote><h2>In order to make good decisions we need a calm frame of mind so that we can pause and reflect, rather than behaving merely reactively – John Sellars</h2></blockquote></div><div><p>But why the emphasis on being calm? Is it really that important to find peace? In the Stoic mindset, it seems, calmness is everything – it is strength. As Aurelius writes in Meditations: &#34;The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.&#34;</p>
<p>Sellars explains: &#34;Calmness is essential to living a good, happy life, Marcus and his fellow Stoics would insist. This is because a disturbed or troubled mind isn’t going to be able to make sensible, rational decisions. The person in the grip of violent emotions, for instance, literally isn&#39;t thinking straight. They have been overcome and may act impulsively or violently. In order to make good decisions we need a calm frame of mind so that we can pause and reflect, rather than behaving merely reactively.&#34; </p>
<p>According to the Stoics, we just need to see that calmness is within our control. Whatever is going on in the world, &#34;it all depends on our judgments and interpretations of situations, not the situations themselves,&#34; explains Sellars. The philosopher Epictetus, he adds, who was Aurelius&#39;s primary influence, wrote: &#34;When we are frustrated, angry or unhappy, never hold anyone except ourselves – that is, our judgements – accountable.&#34;</p>
<p>This core Stoic idea was, says Sellars, &#34;a huge influence on the founders of modern cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and its effectiveness has been proven by the many studies of CBT that have been made&#34;. </p></div><div id="culture/article/20230120-five-ways-to-be-calm-and-why-it-matters-p0dxdd1y"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0dxdd1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0dxdd1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0dxdd1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0dxdd1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0dxdd1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0dxdd1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0dxdd1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0dxdd1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="The electronic album Stellar Drifting by George FitzGerald is inspired by the cosmos – Setting Sun is a particularly tranquil listen (Credit: George FitzGerald)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0dxdd1y.jpg" alt="The electronic album Stellar Drifting by George FitzGerald is inspired by the cosmos – Setting Sun is a particularly tranquil listen (Credit: George FitzGerald)" id=""/></picture><div><p>The electronic album Stellar Drifting by George FitzGerald is inspired by the cosmos – Setting Sun is a particularly tranquil listen (Credit: George FitzGerald)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>Electronic escape</strong></p>
<p>From supposedly soothing pan pipes to ambient rainforest sounds, we are all accustomed to the stock idea of soundscapes as a calming backdrop. But of course the sounds that each of us find restful are by definition a personal thing, and there is no one-size-fits-all soundtrack that will promote peacefulness for all.</p>
<p>Just as the Stoics emphasised perspective and how small each of us is compared to the whole of the cosmos, electronic music artist George FitzGerald looked to the universe and the stars for inspiration for his 2022 album <a href="https://www.george-fitzgerald.com/">Stellar Drifting</a>. The musician <a href="https://musictech.com/features/interviews/george-fitzgerald-interview-new-album-stellar-drifting/">told MusicTech</a>: &#34;To me, [space] represented the furthest point away; the grandest vision of humanity.&#34; FitzGerald spent time in New Mexico driving in the desert and stargazing. &#34;Space gets you out of yourself. It reminds you that we&#39;re tiny and insignificant.&#34;</p>
<p>He took images of the universe collected by Nasa and, by feeding them into new software programmes, converted them into sounds, which he then developed into the 10 tracks on the album. He also used audio recordings from probes that were floating around the solar system.</p>
<p>Electronic, garage and house music have for decades been a form of escapism, first evolving in the interesting margins of society, and uniting disparate groups. And according to FitzGerald, the stars in the sky are an escapism, one that connects all of us. Probably the most calming track on the album is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXNr-Uvvszw">Setting Sun</a>, to be enjoyed not necessarily on a busy dancefloor, but rather lying on a sofa or standing on a hillside, contemplating the vastness of the universe – and our own insignificance.</p></div><div id="culture/article/20230120-five-ways-to-be-calm-and-why-it-matters-p0dxdcmj"><picture><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0dxdcmj.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0dxdcmj.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0dxdcmj.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0dxdcmj.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdcmj.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdcmj.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Hilma af Klint&#39;s The Ten Largest, Group IV, No. 3 Youth 1907 will feature in an upcoming exhibition at the Tate Modern (Credit: Tate/ Courtesy of the Hilma af Klint Foundation)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdcmj.jpg" alt="Hilma af Klint&#39;s The Ten Largest, Group IV, No. 3 Youth 1907 will feature in an upcoming exhibition at the Tate Modern (Credit: Tate/ Courtesy of the Hilma af Klint Foundation)" id=""/></picture><div><p>Hilma af Klint&#39;s The Ten Largest, Group IV, No. 3 Youth 1907 will feature in an upcoming exhibition at the Tate Modern (Credit: Tate/ Courtesy of the Hilma af Klint Foundation)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>Art of tranquillity</strong></p>
<p>Likewise in visual art, one viewer&#39;s tranquil, meditative experience is another&#39;s intense psychodrama. The New Yorker describes the work of Swedish artist Hilma af Kilmt as &#34;fearfully esoteric&#34; and resonating with a &#34;restlessly searching mood in present culture&#34;. For other spectators, masterpieces such as The Ten Largest, Group lV, No. 3 Youth 1907 are quintessentially peaceful in their enigmatic otherworldliness.  </p>
<p>A Swedish mystic and painter, Af Klint developed her own lexicon of pastel-hued shapes several years ahead of other more feted abstract artists. <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/hilma-af-klint-piet-mondrian">An exhibition</a> this April at London&#39;s Tate Modern will explore her work alongside that of Piet Mondrian. &#34;At the heart of both of their artistic journeys was a shared desire to understand the forces behind life on Earth,&#34; says the Tate.</p></div><div><blockquote><h2>Like others before her, Af Klint viewed our existence as only a small element in the larger scheme of things</h2></blockquote></div><div><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20181012-hilma-af-klint-the-enigmatic-vision-of-a-mystic">Af Klint</a> began her career as a landscape painter, inspired by nature, and then her work began to represent natural forms that veered towards abstraction. Spirituality, theosophy and philosophy were central to her out-there vision, and her work reflects that sense of something bigger than us at play – in fact she actually believed her works were painted under the direction of higher spirits. Like others before her, she viewed our existence as only a small element in the larger scheme of things.</p>
<p>Undeniably woo-woo though her vision was, her interest in metaphysics and theosophy was intricate, even semi-scientific, and with its own internal logic – she was drawn to both the spiritualist writings of the founder of the Theosophical Society, Madam Blavatsky, and the philosophical ideas of the Medieval mystic Christian Rosenkreuz. She wanted her work to facilitate spiritual mediation that would transcend physical reality, and to visualise a kind of astral world.</p>
<p>Who knows the precise motivation or meaning behind these extraordinary, liminal, enigmatic artworks? And perhaps that mystery and other-worldliness is what makes the act of looking at them, to some of us at least, such a profoundly peaceful experience.</p>
<p><strong>Harmony of haiku</strong></p>
<p>The traditional form of Japanese poetry, haiku, which consists of 17 syllables in three lines, is widely considered to have a calming effect on the reader. The structure of haiku follows a strict syllable count, and it encourages the poet to focus on a single image or moment, which in itself has a meditative effect. The use of nature imagery in haiku also evokes feelings of serenity and peace. The brevity and simplicity of haiku allows the reader to contemplate and consider the meaning and the imagery without feeling overwhelmed by excessive ideas and language.</p>
<p>Matsuo Bashō of the Edo period, the best known haiku poet – his complete poetry is translated in the book <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/35095/on-love-and-barley-by-basho-trans-lucien-stryk-illus-taiga/9780140444599">On Love and Barley: Haiku of Basho</a> – was born in Iga-ueno near Kyoto in 1644, and he began writing verse while acting as a companion to a local aristocrat. Bashō was not only a master of haiku, but also a Buddhist monk and a great traveller – when he travelled he relied entirely on the hospitality of temples and fellow poets. </p>
<p>His gnomic poems combine the Zen idea of a oneness with creation with <em>kurami</em>, or lightness of touch. Each of his poems evokes a scene from the natural world – a leaping frog, a summer moon, cherry blossom, winter snow – which suggest the smallness of human life in the context of the vastness of nature. Pithy and spare, his most famous haiku is The Old Pond: &#34;Old pond/ A frog jumps in –/ The sound of water&#34;. Another is A Leafless Branch: &#34;On a leafless branch/ A crow comes to rest –/ Autumn nightfall&#34;.</p>
<p>Bashō led a solitary life completely free from possessions. Arguably, his haiku are the result of a keen eye and a meditative mind that have been left clear from the distraction of &#34;stuff&#34;, and so he is more alive to the beauty of the world around him – and closer to his own intuition.</p></div><div id="culture/article/20230120-five-ways-to-be-calm-and-why-it-matters-p0dxdc36"><picture><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0dxdc36.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0dxdc36.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0dxdc36.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0dxdc36.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdc36.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdc36.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="The wandering poet Matsuo Bashō was the master of haiku – he renounced all belongings and travelled far and wide, finding inspiration (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0dxdc36.jpg" alt="The wandering poet Matsuo Bashō was the master of haiku – he renounced all belongings and travelled far and wide, finding inspiration (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""/></picture><div><p>The wandering poet Matsuo Bashō was the master of haiku – he renounced all belongings and travelled far and wide, finding inspiration (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>As Daisetz T Suzuki writes in <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691182964/zen-and-japanese-culture">Zen in the Japanese Culture</a>: &#34;A haiku does not express ideas but… puts forward images reflecting intuitions. These images are not figurative representations made use of by the poetic mind, but they directly point to original intuitions, indeed they are intuitions themselves.&#34; The suggestion is that the composition of haiku is so intuitive, it is almost unconscious.</p>
<p>Haiku and their close attention to the details of nature are part of the wider Japanese concepts of <em>nagomi</em> and <em>ikigai</em>, which roughly translated equate to a sense of meaning and harmony. &#34;[Haiku] gives us an insight into why the word ikigai exists in Japanese,&#34; writes Yukari Mitsuhashi in <a href="https://www.hachette.co.uk/titles/yukari-mitsuhashi/ikigai/9780857835406/">Ikigai: Giving Every Day Meaning and Joy</a>. &#34;In our everyday lives, whether we are immersing ourselves in nature or devouring traditional Japanese food, paying attention to detail grabs our focus on to what is right in front of us, instead of wondering about our to-do lists in our head… permitting us to find joy and ikigai in simple, everyday things.&#34;</p>
<p>And the principles of haiku can be calming when applied to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20221206-japans-most-zen-like-minimalist-interiors">other areas of life</a>, too. In his book <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/305840/goodbye-things-by-sasaki-fumio/9780141986388">Goodbye Things</a>, Funio Sasaki writes: &#34;Traditional paintings have few figures in them and value negative space. Japanese calligraphy and brush paintings are in black and white. Haiku is the shortest poem form in the world. These are a few examples of a minimalistic aesthetic in Japanese art and culture.&#34; In the book, Sasaki, like Bashō all those centuries before, decides to give away most of his possessions, and explores the feeling of calm and tranquillity that results: &#34;There are more things to gain from eliminating excess than you might imagine: time, space, freedom, and energy, for example.&#34;</p>
<p><strong>Find your flow</strong></p>
<p>Calmness is regarded by some with suspicion – is a state of calmness really just a state of passivity? A surrender of engagement, giving up, or, worse, a sociopathic disconnection?</p>
<p>But being calm need not equate with being passive or numb. When we&#39;re absorbed in something we love – music, gardening, drawing, knitting, writing, whatever it is – we can enter an almost trance-like state of calm, mesmerised by what we are doing. As Mitsuhashi argues in her book about ikigai, immersing ourselves in nature or a particular activity makes us focus on what is in front of us, freeing up our minds from other things, and enabling us to find peace.</p>
<p>In her classic work The Artist&#39;s Way, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210105-why-being-creative-is-good-for-you">Julia Cameron</a> encourages the reader to &#34;make a commitment to quiet time&#34;. She writes: &#34;Creativity occurs in the moment, and in the moment we are timeless&#34;.</p>
<p>And author Mihaly Csiksezentmihalyi argues that what really makes us feel not only calm and peaceful, but also glad to be alive, is unlocking a more fulfilling state of being. He calls this state of mind &#34;flow&#34;. In his book <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/346351/flow-by-csikszentmihalyi-mihaly/9781846046957">Flow: The Psychology of Happiness</a>, he throws light on the idea that many philosophers before him have posited – that the way to peace doesn&#39;t lie in mindless detachment, but in mindful challenge. Each of us finds our flow in different ways, and our sense of calm.</p>
