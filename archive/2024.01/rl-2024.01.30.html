To start at the beginning, click </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2023/01/01/well/happiness-challenge" title=""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Predicting how a future event will make us feel is known in psychology as affective forecasting — and most human beings are pretty lousy at it. “People are terrible at knowing what is good for them,” said Dr. Bob Waldinger, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, “and we seem particularly bad at forecasting the benefits of relationships.”</p><p>It can be tempting to just stay home rather than socialize, said Dr. Waldinger, who is an author of the new book “The Good Life.” “We’ll think, ‘I know I’m going to be happy if I stay home and watch Netflix but not if I go to that party.’”</p><p>But interacting with other people, he said, often “improves our mood and makes us happier than we expect it will. Making the choice to go out and be with people involves risk, usually a small one — but offers the possibility for encounters that are enlivening, interesting or just plain fun.”</p><h2 id="link-32aa204a">Happiness Challenge Day 6: Put a social plan on the calendar</h2><p>Your exercise for today is to make a social plan — a walk with the old friend you never seem to see, lunch with the former co-worker who always made you laugh — and put it on the calendar. If you’ve ever told someone you like that you should get coffee “sometime,” today’s the day to make it official. Do not cancel or postpone.</p></div><div><p>“Many of us might be out of shape when it comes to socializing,” said Philip Gable, an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Delaware. Motivate yourself to go out by setting small goals instead of larger ones, he suggested. Instead of committing to be at a party for three hours, he said, give yourself a half-hour, or vow that you’ll chat with three people. And of course it doesn’t have to be a party. A face-to-face human interaction of any sort, especially one that might build toward more social dates in the future, is what we’re aiming for today.</p><h2 id="link-733703eb">There’s a group out there for everybody</h2><p>A good way to build ties is by joining a group that meets regularly — say, a pickle-ball team at the local gym. Researchers call that regular proximity with other humans <a href="https://sk.sagepub.com/reference/socialpsychology/n422.xml" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">propinquity</a> and have shown that the more propinquity we have, the greater the chances are that we’ll form friendships.</p><div><div id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"><hr/><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

There are a ton of addons, knobs, and work that has to be doen to build a sustainable and &#34;production ready&#34; version of K8s (for my requirements) in AWS.<p>K8s is NOT easy, and I do not believe that in it&#39;s current form it is the pinnacle of deployment/orchestration technologies. I am waiting for what is next, because the pain that I have personally experienced around K8s that I know others are feeling as well does not make it a perfect solution for everything, and definitely not usable for others.</p><p>At the end of the day it&#39;s a tool, and it is sometimes difficult to work with.

Let&#39;s not dismiss other&#39;s experience just because it doesn&#39;t match our own, the truth is most likely somewhere in the middle. Especially when so many people are clamoring saying that they had pain using K8s.<p>The initial deployment for EKS requires multiple plugins to get to something that is &#34;functional&#34; for most production workloads. K8s fails in spectacular ways (even using Argo, worse using Argo TBH) that require manual intervention. Local disk support for certain types of workloads is severely depressing. Helm is terrible (templating Yaml... &#39;nuff said). Security groups, IAM roles, and other cloud provider functions require deep knowledge of K8s and the cloud provider. Autoscaling using Karpenter is difficult to debug. Karpenter doesn&#39;t gracefully handle spot instance cost.</p><p>I could go on, but these are the things you will experience in the first couple days of attempting to use k8s. Overall, if you have deep knowledge of K8s, go for it, but It is not the end-all solution to Infra/container orchestration in my mind.</p><p>I fought with a workload for over a day with our K8s experts, it took me an hour to deploy it to an EC2 ASG for a temporary release while moving it back to K8s later. K8s IS difficult, and saying it&#39;s not has a lot of people questioning the space.</p><p>The way I see it is it starts off easy, and quickly ramps up to extremely complex. This should not be the case.</p><p>I worked at a company that had their own deployment infra stack and it was 1000x better than K8s. This is going to be the next step in the K8s space I believe and it may use K8s underneath the covers, but the level of abstraction for K8s is all wrong IMO and it is trying to do too much.

    ansible.builtin.group:
      name: somegroup
      gid: 2000
      state: present
  
  - name: Ensure that we have a user that belongs to the group
    ansible.builtin.user:
      name: someuser
      uid: 3000
      shell: /bin/bash
      groups: somegroup
      append: yes
      state: present
</code></pre>
This can help you setup some monitoring for the nodes themselves, install updates, mess around with any PKI stuff you need to do and so on, everything that you could achieve either manually or by some Bash scripts running through SSH. Better yet, the people who just want to run the containers won&#39;t have to think about any of this, so it ensures separation of concerns as well.<p>Deploying apps through Ansible directly can work, but most of the container orchestrators might admittedly be better suited for this, if you are okay with containerized workloads. There, they all shine: Docker Swarm, Hashicorp Nomad, Kubernetes (K3s is really great) and so on...

Here&#39;s one way to avoid the issues you described on bare metal:<p>- Only get servers with IPMI so you can remote reboot / power cycle them.</p><p>- Have said servers netboot so they always run the newest OS image.</p><p>- Make sure said OS image has a config that isn&#39;t broken so you don&#39;t get full inodes and so it cycles logs.</p><p>- Have the OS image include journalbeat to ship logs.</p><p>- Have your health checks trigger a recovery script that restarts or moves containers using one of a myriad of tools; monitoring isn&#39;t exactly a new discipline.</p><p>Yes, it means you have to have a build process for OS images. Yes, it means you need to pick a monitoring system. And yes, it means you need to decide a scheduling policy.</p><p>I wrote an orchestrator pre-K8S that was fewer LOC than the <i>yaml config</i> for my home test K8S cluster. Writing a custom orchestrator is often not hard, depending on your workload, - writing a generic one is.</p><p>K8S provides <i>one opinionated version</i> of what people build manually, and when it&#39;s a good fit, it&#39;s great. When it isn&#39;t, I all to often see people spend more time trying to figure out how to make it work for them than it would&#39;ve taken them to do it from scratch.

I think anyone that&#39;s been a Systems Engineer that&#39;s over 30 has probably deployed every one of these.</p><p>One thing I&#39;ve learned over my mixed SWE and SE career is that infrastructure is expensive and grows regardless of revenue. I didn&#39;t truly appreciate this until I launched Kubernetes on Digital Ocean and began running my personal cloud on it. It was costing me over $100/m for very little. That money was gone whether I pushed a ton of VPN traffic over my mesh or not. It didn&#39;t care about how much I stored in the disk I reserved, and frankly, that cost was going to grow as time went on. I pulled the plug, setup servers in my house, wired up Traefik and Docker Compose V2 with a little Tailscale sprinkled on. The servers stay up to date with some scripts, I deploy new apps on select servers with Docker Compose and Docker profiles.</p><p>It&#39;s possible for companies to do similar things, but not to the extremes I took it to. A really good infrastructure SWE generally goes for $300k. You can pay people with an expertise in these things who can streamline them and create maintainable products out of your infrastructure or you can pay for Legos and glue from a managed service provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure. At some point the latters costs will not scale, you&#39;ll pivot and cost reduce many times - maybe even begin rearchitecting. I think there&#39;s a lot of companies that are noe realizing the cheap money is gone, and the cloud has somewhat relied on cheap money.

I come from a background of running small startups on a shoe string budget. I need to make tough choices when it comes to this stuff. I can either develop features or start spending double digit percentages of my development budget on devops. So, I aim to minimize cost and time (same thing) for all of that. At the same time, I appreciate things like observable software, rapid CI/CD cycles, and generally not having a lot of snow flakes as part of my deployment architecture. I actually have worked with a lot of really competent people over the past two decades and I like to think I&#39;m not a complete noob on this front. In other words, I&#39;m not a naive idiot but actually capable of making some informed choices here.<p>That has lead me down a path of making very consistent choices over the years:</p><p>1) no kubernetes and no microservices. Microservices are Conways Law mapped to your deployment architecture. You don&#39;t need that if you do monoliths. And if you have a monolith, kubernetes is a waste of CPU, Memory, and development time. Complete overkill with zero added value.</p><p>2) the optimal size of a monolith deployment is 2 cheap VMs and a load balancer. You can run that for tens of dollars in most popular cloud environments. Good enough for zero down time deployments and having failover across availability zones. And you can scale it easily if needed (add more vms, bigger vms, etc.).</p><p>3) those two vms must not be snow flakes and be replaceable without fanfare, ceremony, or any manual intervention. So use docker and docker-compose on a generic linux host, preferably of the managed variety.  Most developers can do a simple Dockerfile and wing it with docker-compose. It&#39;s not that hard. And it makes CI/CD really straight forward. Put the thing in the container registry, run the thing. Use something like Github actions to automate. Cheap and easy.</p><p>4) Use hosted/managed middleware (databases, search clusters, queues, etc). Running that stuff in some DIY setup is rarely worth the development time and operational overhead (devops, monitoring, backups, upgrades, etc). All this overhead rapidly adds up to costing more than years of paying for a managed solution. If you think in hours and market conform rates for people even capable of doing this stuff, that is. Provision the thing, use the thing, and pay tens of dollars per month for it. Absolute no brainer. When you hit thousands per month, you might dedicate some human resources to figuring out something cheaper.</p><p>5) Automate things that you do often. Don&#39;t automate things that you only do once (like creating a production environment). Congratulations, you just removed the need for having people do anything with teraform, cloudformation, chef, puppet, ansible, etc. Hiring people that can do those things is really expensive. And even though I can do all of those, it&#39;s literally not worth my time. Document it, but don&#39;t automate it unless you really need to and spend your money on feature development.</p><p>But when I need to choose between hiring 1 extra developer or paying similarly expensive hosting bills, I&#39;ll prefer to have the extra developer on my team. Every time. Hosting bills can be an order of magnitude cheaper than a single developer on a monthly basis if you do it properly. For reference, we pay around 400/month for our production environment. That&#39;s in Google cloud and with an Elastic Cloud search cluster included.</p><p>Other companies make other choices of course for all sorts of valid reasons. But these work fine for me and I feel good about the trade offs.

I think system design interviews are partly to blame because they select for people who think that the only way to design a system is the cargo cult method that interview prep books and courses preach, which is:<p>- break everything into microservices</p><p>- have a separate horizontally scalable layer for load balancing, caching, stateless application server, database servers, monitoring/metrics, for each microservice.</p><p>- use at least two different types of databases because it&#39;s <i>haram</i> to store key-value data in a RDBMS</p><p>- sprinkle in message-passing queues and dead-letter queues between every layer because every time you break one system into two, there can be a scenario where one part is down but the other is up</p><p>- replicate that in 10 different datacenters because I&#39;ll be damned if a user in New York needs to talk to a server in Dallas</p><p>And all this for a service that will see at most 10k transactions per second. In other words, something that a single high-end laptop can handle.</p><p>99.9% of the time your architecture does NOT need to look like Facebook&#39;s or Google&#39;s. 99% of tech startups (including some unicorns) can run their entire product out of a couple of good baremetals.

I&#39;m currently working at the opposite of a startup with a shoestring budget. We&#39;re a medium-sized company with 100 - 150 techies in there. As a unique problem, we&#39;re dealing with a bunch of rather sensitive data - financial data, HR data, forecast and planning data. Our customers are big companies, and they are careful with this data. As such, we&#39;re forced to self-host a large amount of our infrastructure, because this turns from a stupid decision into a unique selling point in that space.<p>From there, we have about 7 - 12 of those techies working either in my team, saas operations, our hardware ops team, or a general support team for CI/images/deployment/buildserver things. 5 - 10% of the manpower goes there, pretty much.</p><p>The interesting thing is: Your perspective is our dream vision for teams running on our infrastructure.</p><p>Like - 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3: Ideally, you as the development team shouldn&#39;t have to care about the infrastructure that much. Grab the container image build templates and guidelines for your language, put them into the template nomad job for your stuff, add the template pipeline into your repository, end up with CD to the test environment. Add 2-3 more pipelines, production deployments works.</p><p>These default setups do have a half life. They will fail eventually with enough load and complexity coming in from a product. But that&#39;s a &#34;succeed too hard&#34; kinda issue. &#34;Oh no, my deployment isn&#39;t smooth enough for all the customer queries making me money. What a bother&#34; And honestly, for 90% of the products not blazing trails, we have seem most problems so we can help them fix their stuff with little effort to them.</p><p>4 - We very much want to standardize and normalize things onto simple shared services, in order to both simplify the stuff teams have to worry about and also to strengthen teams against pushy customers. A maintained, tuned, highly available postgres is just a ticket, documented integrations and a few days of wait away and if customers are being pushy about the nonfunctional requirements, give them our guarantees and then send them to us.

It&#39;s zero maintenance and really simple. Plus its ability to weave together different services (like configuring Fastly and Route53 from the same place) is handy, too.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Once you go above that size then having to manage IAM starting becoming a pain. Usually around the same point public cloud costs start becoming noticeable to your finance team and so you have to start dealing with questions around that. Usually that&#39;s a good point to do a sanity check before things get even bigger and more expensive.</p><p>Similar k8s works well for certain classes of problem, but doesn&#39;t work well for all classes of problem. Any form of k8s has an operational overhead and you really need to make sure that you are going to get the ROI from the effort of maintaining the stack for it to be worthwhile.

  3) deployments are tricky if there&#39;s nothing before the executable (stop, update, restart =&gt; downtime)

  4) if cache is in-process, on a restart it will have to be repopulated from scratch, leading to temporary slowdowns (+ and maybe a thundering herd problem) which will happen *every time* you deploy an update

I think much of it is ignoreable if the site is just a personal blog or a static site. But if the site is a real time &#34;web application&#34; which people rely on for work, then you still need:<pre><code>  1) some kind of containerization, to deal with inevitable entropy (when a container is restarted, everything is back to the initial clean state)

  2) at least two instances of the application: one instance crashes =&gt; the second one picks up traffic; or during rolling updates: while one instance is being killed and replaced with a new version, traffic is routed to another instance

  3) persistent data (and sometimes caches) need to be replicated (and backed up) -- we&#39;ve had many hardware issues corrupting DBs

  4) automatic failover to a different machine in case the machine is dead beyond repair

&gt;not some external monster tool like k8s<p>What can you use instead of k8s for this kind of scenario? (an ultra reliable setup which doesn&#39;t need a whole cluster)

And even then, two identical boxes (instead of binpacking into a cluster, increasing failure probability) go a very long way.<p>It&#39;s a vicious circle. We build distributed multi-node systems, overlay software-configured networks, self-healing clusters, separate distributed control planes, split everything into microservices, but it all makes systems <i>more</i> fragile unless enough effort is spent on supporting all that infrastructure. Google might not have a choice to scale vertically, but the overwhelming majority of companies do. Hell, even StackOverflow still scales vertically after all these years!

Many bugs are pretty rare bugs which are triggered only under specific conditions (a user, or the system, must do X, Y, Z at the right moment). So it doesn&#39;t happen all the time. But when it happens, the whole server crashes or starts behaving in a funky way and other users are affected. Sure you may say if it&#39;s a rare bug, then users will be rarely affected. But we don&#39;t have a single bug like that, there&#39;s always N such bugs lurking around (we never know how many of them in a large application); multiply it by N bugs and you have server crashes for different reasons quite often, making your paying customers dissatisfied. It also assumes you can fix such a bug immediately while it&#39;s not always true, there&#39;s often Heisenbugs it takes weeks to root out and fix, while your customers are affected (sure the application will restart but ALL users (not just the one who triggered the bug) can loose work, get random errors when the app is not available -- not a good experience). So having several app instances for backup allows to soften such blows, because there will always be at least one app instance which is available.</p><p>&gt;Entropy increases with complex setup. The whole point of not having a complex setup is to reduce entropy and make the system as whole more predictable</p><p>I agree that entropy increases with complex setup, but there&#39;s also base entropy which accumulates simply because of time (which I think is more dangerous). Like make a sufficient number of changes to the setup of your application (which you often need if you release often) and eventually someone or something somewhere will make a mistake or expose a bug somewhere, and you will need to repair it and you won&#39;t be able do it easily because your setup is not containerized which would allow to return to the clean state quite easily with no effort. We&#39;ve had issues like that with our non-containerized deployments and it&#39;s a very complex and error-prone undertaking to do it flawlessly (no downtime or regressions) compared to containerized deployments.</p><p>&gt;Plus modern CPUs are incredibly fast and can process several GBs of data per second. Even in the worst cases, you should be able to rebuild all your caches in a second</p><p>Hm, usually caches are placed in front of disk-based DB&#39;s to speed up I/O, i.e. it&#39;s not a matter of slow CPU&#39;s, it&#39;s a matter of slow I/O. Rebuilding everything which is in the caches from DB sources is not super fast.

You can&#39;t address that problem by moving from EKS back to ECS, like one commenter suggested.</p><p>* They&#39;ve decided to move from K8s to mrsk, a system they developed. They&#39;re fuzzier about why they did that, but the two fairly clear claims they made: (1) their deployments under K8s are a lot more complicated, and (2) they slashed their deploy times (because a great deal of their infra is now statically defined).</p><p>I feel like there&#39;s more productive debating to be done about K8s vs mrsk than there is about EKS vs. mrsk. By all means, make the case that applications like Tadalist are best run on K8s rather than a set of conventions around bare-metal container/VMs (which is all mrsk is).

I think the only robust solution at the time was openshift which was well, k8s without being vanilla k8s.<p>Also most tools that were build to manage k8s cluster were nice to deploy a new cluster, not so much to upgrade a cluster so you would have to create new clusters every time you wanted an upgrade. It can scale when clusters and blast radius is small but can be complicated when it involves contributions from n teams.
For this reason when we were managing our own k8s cluster on prem, we were using kubespray which worked but upgrades were a multiple hours affair.

For nodes, pick something reasonable. We&#39;re naive so we pick us-west1 and a cheap SKU with 2 vCPUs 8 GB is ~$30/mo after discounts. We&#39;re scrappy so we eschew multiple zones (it&#39;s not like the nearby colo is any better) so let&#39;s grab two of these at most. Now we&#39;re in $60/mo. We could go cheaper if we want.</p><p>We&#39;ve click-opsed our way here in about 25 minutes. The cluster is up and ready for action.</p><p>I write a Dockerfile, push my container, install k3d locally, write about 200 lines of painstaking YAML that I mostly cribbed off of stack overflow, and slam that through kubectl into my local cluster. Everything is coming up roses, so I kubectl apply to my GKE cluster. My app is now live and I crack open a beer. Today was a good day.</p><p>Later, whilst inebriated from celebration, I make some changes to the app and deploy live because I&#39;m a cowboy. Oops, the app fails to start but that&#39;s okay, the deployment rolls back. No one notices.</p><p>The next day my app hits the front page of HN and falls over. I edit my YAML and change a 2 to a 10 and everything is good again.</p><p>Things I did not need to care about:</p><p>- permissions (I just used the defaults and granted everything via clickops)</p><p>- ssh keys (what&#39;s ssh?)</p><p>- Linux distributions or VM images (the Goog takes care of everything for me, I sleep better knowing I&#39;ll wake up to patched OS)</p><p>- passwords</p><p>- networking, VIPs, top of rack switches, hosting contracts, Dell, racking and stacking, parking, using my phone</p><p>And all without breaking the bank.</p><p>---</p><p>Okay so I cheated, you weren&#39;t looking for a GKE vs on-prem/Colo case. You asked</p><p>&gt; make the case that applications like Tadalist are best run on K8s rather than a set of conventions around bare-metal container/VMs</p><p>to which I say: that&#39;s all kubernetes is.</p><p>Did you even read their blog post? virtio? F5? MySQL replication?? How is this a good use of engineering time? How is this cost efficient? On what planet is running your own metal a good use of time or money or any other godforsaken resource. They&#39;re not even 40 people for crying out loud. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re, say, Fly.io and trying to host arbitrary workloads for customers. They&#39;re literally serving rails apps.</p><p>Want to start small with k8s? Throw k3s or k3d on a budget VPS of your choosing. Be surprised when you can serve production traffic on a $20 Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>If you <i>care</i> about Linux distributions, and <i>care</i> about networking, and <i>care</i> about database replication, and <i>care</i> about KVM, and <i>care</i> about aggregating syslogs, and <i>love</i> to react to CVEs and patch things, <i>and if it&#39;s a good use of your time</i>, then sure do what 37signals did here. But I&#39;m not sure what that planet is. It&#39;s certainly not the one I live on today. 10-15 years ago? Sure. But no longer.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe just how ridiculous this entire article is. I want to find quotes to cherry pick but the entire thing is lunacy. You can do so <i>so much</i> on a cloud provider before approaching the cost of even a single 48U in a managed space.</p><p>At some scale it makes sense, but not their scale. If I never have to deal with iDRAC again it&#39;ll be too soon.</p><p>You have a horse in this race: apps like Tadalist are best run on something like Fly or knative/Cloud Run or Heroku rest in peace. But a set of conventions around bare-metal containers/VMs? Give me a break.</p><p>I don&#39;t think you intended it, but I find it disingenuous to separate cloud hosting and kubernetes. The two are connected. The entire premise is that it should be a set of portable conventions. I can run things on my laptop or desktop or raspberry pi or $10/mo budget VPS or GCP or AWS or Azure or Linode or god willing a bunch of bare-metal in a colo. It&#39;s fundamentally a powerful abstraction. In isolation it makes little sense, which TFA handedly demonstrates. If you eschew the conventions, it&#39;s not like the problems go away. You just have to solve them yourself. This is all just NIH syndrome, clear as day.</p><p>Forgive the long winded rant, it&#39;s been a long day.

                  <p><span>Agree, I would never want to go back to the old bad days of managing a real rack at a datacenter, with exactly the same guarantees of a single region deployment inside any cloud.
BUT it is true that all the multi region/AZ guarantees + logs + dashboards + network services @ AWS costs tend to skyrocket in a couple of years.
And here is where k8s really shines, in my opinion: allowing you to abstract your deployment away from a cloud even on cheap hosting.
All the rest outlined in the article is just reinventing the wheel.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Apps were all running on VMs anyway so the complexity was not seen by the same people. Storage were a multiple years deal. The biggest issue was storage estimation and paying from day 1 a storage that would be used fully only on year 5. But I don&#39;t think it was that expensive, just an accountability gymnastic comparing to a pay as you go system. And hyperconvergence was kind of meant to solve that although I didn&#39;t really had the chance to experiment with it in virtualized environments on prem.

It&#39;s actually one of the most very straight forward and thoughtfully designed platforms I&#39;ve ever worked with.<p>What I&#39;ve found in my experience is that applications in general are complex -- more complex than people assume -- but the imperative style of provisioning seems to hide it away, and not in a good way. The inherent complexity hides behind layers of iterative, mutating actions where any one step seems &#34;simple&#34;, but the whole increasingly gets lost in the entropic background, and in the end the system gets more and more difficult to _actually_ understand and reproduce.</p><p>Tools like ansible and terraform and kubernetes have been attempts to get towards more definition, better consistency, _away_ from the imperative. Even though an individual step under the hood may be imperative, the goal is always toward eventual consistency, which, really only kubernetes truly achieves.  By contrast, MRSK feels to be subtly turning that arrow around in the wrong direction.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it was fun to build, but one could have spent 1% of that time getting to understand the &#34;complexity&#34; of kubernetes - by the way, which quickly disappears once it&#39;s understood. Understandably, though, that would feel like a defeat to someone who truly enjoys building new systems from scratch (and we need those people).

You cannot limit them to X bytes.  So, if you give a single service a volume, it might just take the whole disk.  Well, technically, it might just take the whole filesystem, which, if you have multiple disks used by a single filesytem, will mean it&#39;ll take all of them.<p>Obviously, you cannot move local volumes around.</p><p>And if you are setting up a database in Kubernetes... oh, you are in such a pit of troubles, that dealing with local volumes isn&#39;t really even worth mentioning.  Surprisingly, your problems don&#39;t even start with storage, they start with memory.  Databases really like memory, but use it very opportunistically, and scale well with load.  So, when you configure your database, you tend to give them all the memory you have, but when they use it, it will really depend on the load and the kind of queries, how well they optimize it.  Since Kubernetes scheduler doesn&#39;t really do well with reservations, you may run into situations where your database OOMs or just slows everything down, or doesn&#39;t perform well at all...</p><p>Next comes fsync.  Unlike many unsophisticated applications, databases don&#39;t like losing data.  That&#39;s why they want to use fsync in some capacity.  But this creates problems sharing resources, again, well beyond anything Kubernetes can help with.</p><p>Next comes provisioning of high-quality storage for databases... and storage likes to come in the form of a device, not filesystem, but Kubernetes doesn&#39;t know how to deal with devices, so, it needs a help from CSIs of all sorts to do that, and depending on technology you choose, you&#39;ll have a very immersive journey into the world of hacks and muti-thousand page protocol descriptions telling you how to connect your storage and Kubernetes.</p><p>It might appear though, at the first glance, that things work well w/o much intervention, and there&#39;s a Helm chart for this or the other provider, and it&#39;s all at the tips of your fingers... but, as it often is in the world of storage, things get extremely complicated extremely quickly in case of errors.  In such situations, Kubernetes will only obscure the problem.  Oh, and errors in storage don&#39;t usually happen in the next hour or day or even year after you&#39;ve set it up.  It hits you few years later, once you&#39;ve accumulated a ton of useful data and you&#39;ve entirely forgotten how things have been set up, and folks in Kubernetes had moved on and broke stuff.</p><p>---</p><p>So, not only do you need small scale, you also need a very short temporal scale: don&#39;t expect your Kubernetes cluster to work well after about a year of being deployed. Probably not at all after five years.</p><p>But then... if it only works at small scale and for short time? -- is it really worth the trouble? I mean, Kubernetes isn&#39;t a small thing, it takes away a big constant share of your resources, which it promises to amortize with scale.  You are essentially preaching the same idea as Electron-based desktop applications or Docker containers that create a lot of duplication of entire Linux user-space + a bunch of common libraries if you aren&#39;t extremely careful with that. Doesn&#39;t it become an argument for producing hot garbage as fast as possible so that someone else who can do a better job won&#39;t get a chance of selling their goods because they didn&#39;t have time to deliver?

You just can&#39;t know it when you start developing. It takes a bit of ego and ambition to go that path, but sometimes it pays off. And my guess is that if it paid off in the past, you&#39;re more likely to try it again.
