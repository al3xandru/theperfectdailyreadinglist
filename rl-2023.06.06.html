						<p>Dear readers, it is with troublesome news I break my three months of silence.</p>
<p>The statistics all point towards the same conclusion: we have a global outbreak of fuckarounditis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fuckarounditis is a behavioral disorder characterized by a mediocre physique and complete lack of progress, despite significant amounts of time spent in the gym.</p>
<p>Fuckarounditis most commonly manifests itself as an intense preoccupation with crunches, curls, cable movements, belts, gloves, balance boards, Swiss Balls and Tyler Durden. Fear of squats and deadlifts is another distinguishing trait. Physical exertion is either completely lacking or misapplied (towards questionable or unproductive training practices).</p>
<p>Despite an alarming increase of fuckarounditis in recent years, prevalance may vary greatly depending on location. However, in most commercial gyms, it has been estimated that 90-100% of individuals are afflicted to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Environment and social networks are crucial factors for triggering the disease. It has been proposed that the roots of the disease stems from misinformation and counterproductive training advice found in popular media (“fitness magazines”) and information hubs on the Internet.</p>
<p>Human nature and the so-called “laziness”, “magic bullet” and “complacency” genes plays a permissive role for allowing the disease to take hold.</p>
<p>The disease spreads rapidly, as carriers of the disease communicate with other individuals in locker rooms, Internet discussion forums and other arenas of interaction and information exchange in real life or otherwise.</p>
<p>The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood and may go undiagnosed for a lifetime. Diagnosis is set by a professional and based on observed behaviors and physique progress.</p>
<p>Symptoms, preventative measures and intervention strategies are reviewed and discussed.</p>
<cite>Berkhan, M. (2011)</cite><br/>
	<cite>“Targeting The Fuckarounditis Epidemic: Preventative Measures and Intervention Strategies.”</cite></blockquote>
<h2>Fuckarounditis: A Serious Threat</h2>
<p>I have been trying to cure people of fuckarounditis since the late 90’s, starting from the day I was first cleansed from it myself. Ever since I recognized the disease, I have acknowledged it as a serious threat to physique development and mental well-being. It is therefore with shock and horror I have watched an increasing number of people fall victim to the disease and the dubious training practices it inspires.</p>
<p>In educating myself of good strength training practices, I was very lucky. Yes, I wasted some time with the usual bench’n’curl/bodybuilding magazine-inspired crapola all my friends were doing, spending my time in the gym joking around more than doing any actual training. I was 16 or so when I first set my foot at the gym. (See <a href="https://leangains.com/tag/my-transformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“My Transformation”</a> for pictures from this time period.)</p>
<p>However, I did not spend more than a few months fooling around with my friends. I found that I enjoyed strength training, so I started to take an increasing interest in the topic. I started to explore and I eventually came across an excellent resource that set the tone for my entire approach and attitude. The resource was the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9963916368/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwleanga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=9963916368" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond Brawn</a> by Stuart McRobert, and it taught me the value of working hard at the right things.</p>
<p>However, I may have never been lucky enough to find this tome of wisdom if I had first lost myself in the malicious maze that resides behind…<em>the illusion of complexity.</em></p>
<h3>The Illusion of Complexity</h3>
<p>The Internet provides a rich soil for fuckarounditis to grow and take hold of the unsuspecting observer. Too much information, shit, clutter, woo-woo, noise, bullshit, loony toon theories, too many quacks, morons and people with good intentions giving you bad advice and uninformed answers. Ah yes, the information age.</p>
<p>Some of it is bullshit wrapped up in a fancy paper with scientific terms, elaborate detail, promising cutting edge strategies based on the latest research. This makes it easier to swallow for intellectuals and those seeking a quick fix; two different groups, both equally susceptible to bullshittery and easy prey for scam artists.</p>
<p>Yes, if anything has surprised me so far in my work, it’s the complete disassociation between IQ and “exercise intelligence” (essentially common sense and knowledge in regards to training fundamentals). I have many clients from academic circles, many clients that are very successful financially and in their each respective field, but some were complete idiots with regards to their training before they came to me.</p>
<p>The problem at the core of the fuckarounditis epidemic is the overabundance of information we have available to us. If there are so many theories, articles and opinions on a topic, we perceive it as something complex, something hard to understand. An illusion of complexity is created.</p>
<p>We must read everything. Think long and hard about our choices. Only then can we hope to make an informed choice, we reason. And there are <em>so many choices</em>. Finally, that which we perceive as a good and informed choice is often the complete opposite, usually the result of whatever fad routine is trendy at the moment. Sometimes we do a little bit of everything – “can’t be bad trying to be ‘well-rounded’ now, can it?” we foolishly argue.</p>
<p>When it comes to strength training, the right choices are limited and uncomplicated. There are right and wrong ways to do things, not “it depends”, not alternative theories based on new science that we need to investigate or try. Basic do’s and don’t’s that never change. Unfortunately, these fundamental training principles are lost to many, and stumbling over them is like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>Isn’t it the same with nutrition? Do we have diet-related fuckarounditis? Sure enough, there’s diet-related fuckarounditis; people who live in the fear of insulin faeries, avoid carbs like the plague for a few days and then binge the hell out of a few boxes of cereal, and never manage to get lean, for example.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to training-related fuckarounditis, rates of diet-related fuckarounditis have remained fairly stable. The lipophobes have merely been replaced by carbophobes. On the whole, I might even venture to say that people have been getting a bit smarter with regards to nutrition. Not so with training practices, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Yes, the global prevalence of fuckarounditis is increasing at an alarming rate. The plethora of bad choices increases at a much higher rate than the good choices. Soon the bad choices will all but drown out the good ones, I fear.</p>
<h3>“I See Weak People”</h3>
<p>In my dreams? No. In gyms? Yes. Walking around like regular people. They don’t see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don’t know they’re weak.</p>
<p>The afflicted are everywhere; the Shape Magazine-reading receptionist who greets you at the gym, the 135-lb skinny-fat PT who tells you that deadlifts are off limits, the bandana wearing bro in the cable-cross machine and the guy with entire day devoted to “abs”. All of them suffer to varying degrees of the debilitating disorder known as fuckarounditis. Yes, even you might be among the afflicted. Today you shall find out if there is cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a disease that sneaks up on you and then progresses gradually. Some people walk around with a mild case of fuckarounditis that do not completely impair their results in its initial stages. In others, the disease has reached a severe state, which dramatically interferes with their progress and usually stalls it completely.</p>
<p>Finally, there are those who are all but lost and for whom there is little hope of a cure. Unfortunately, these people will probably never read this. They are too busy emulating the latest bodybuilding pro, doing the Biceps Blaster routine, or rolling around on a Swiss Ball somewhere.</p>
<p>How can you tell if you are suffering from the fuckarounditis? Ultimately, it boils down to your results and whether your progress is reasonable relative to the time you put in.</p>
<p>Let’s be concrete and talk numbers. After all, there needs to be some overarching and objective way of judging whether you are afflicted or not.</p>
<h3>Progress and Goals</h3>
<p>For someone interested in aesthetics, which I assume most my readers are, relative strength is the single best measure of progress and the quality of your physique. Before seeing a picture of a client, I can easily get a very good idea of his or hers body composition by simply knowing three stats: weight, height and strength. Relative strength is therefore the parameter that will be used to determine reasonable rates of progress, which will then tell you whether you might be suffering of  fuckarounditis or not.</p>
<p>Within two years of consistent training on a decent routine, the average male should be able to progress to the following levels of strength (1RM):</p>
<p><strong>Strength Goals: Intermediate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bench press: body weight x 1.2</li>
<li>Chin-ups or pull-ups: body weight x 1.2 or 8 reps with body weight.</li>
<li>Squat: body weight x 1.6</li>
<li>Deadlift: body weight x 2</li>
</ul>
<p>These numbers are for a raw (no straps, belt or knee wraps) single repetition.</p>
<p>The progress towards the intermediate strength goals should be fairly linear, meaning that there should be no plateaus that cannot be solved in an uncomplicated manner. By “consistent” training I do not mean never missing a training day, nor do I consider taking 2-3 months off from training consistent.</p>
<p>By “decent training routine”, I mean “not doing blatantly stupid shit” (training 5-6 days/week, 20-25 sets for chest and arms, etc.). I do not mean optimal and flawless.</p>
<p><strong>Strength Goals: Advanced </strong></p>
<p>Under the exact same conditions as the previous example, 3 out of 4 of the following goals should be reached within five years, along with all of the strength goals listed under “intermediate”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bench press: body weight x 1.5</li>
<li>Chin-ups or pull-ups: body weight x 1.5 or 15 reps with body weight.</li>
<li>Squat: body weight x 2</li>
<li>Deadlift: body weight x 2.5</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strength Goals: Highly Advanced </strong></p>
<p>Under the exact same conditions, all of the following goals should be reached within ten years. Alternatively, 3 out of 4 should be reached, and one should be “Elite”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bench press: body weight x 1.5, or x 1.8 (elite)</li>
<li>Chin-ups or pull-ups: body weight x 1.5 or 15 reps with body weight, or x 1.8 / 20 reps (elite)</li>
<li>Squat: body weight x 2, or x 2.4 (elite)</li>
<li>Deadlift: body weight x 2.5, or x 3 (elite)</li>
</ul>
<p>“Elite” denotes one lift that is often ahead of the others. For example, people who are natural pullers (long arms) may very well hit a 3 x body weight deadlift before a 1.5 x body weight bench, and vice versa for the presser (short arms, stocky and barrel-chested) benching 1.8 x body weight but not being able to pull 2.5 x body weight in the deadlift.</p>
<p>The highly advanced strength goals falls in line with what could be considered the pinnacle of physique and strength development <a href="https://leangains.com/maximum-muscular-potential-of-drug-free-athletes-updated-dec-31st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for most average and natural trainers</a>. At this point, progress is very slow.</p>
<p>A 185-lb male that has been training consistently for 5-10 years should therefore be expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bench press 275-280 lbs.</li>
<li>Do a chin-up with 90-95 lbs hanging from his waist.</li>
<li>Squat 370 lbs.</li>
<li>Deadlift 460-465 lbs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Respective goals for women:</strong></p>
<p>For women in the 115-155-lb range, the corresponding advanced strength goals are 0.9 x body weight bench, 1.1 x body weight chin-up, 1.5 x body weight squat and 1.8 x body weight deadlift. Relative to men, women have much less muscle mass around the chest area and shoulder girdle (men have much higher androgen-receptor density in this particular area), but the lower body is comparativly strong to the upper body.</p>
<p>A 135-lb woman that has been training consistently for 5-10 years should then be expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bench press 120-125 lbs.</li>
<li>Do 4-5 chin-ups with body weight or do one with an extra 10-15 lbs hanging from her waist.</li>
<li>Squat 200-205 lbs.</li>
<li>Deadlift 225-230 lbs.</li>
</ul>
<p>So where do you fall in regards to these goals? If you’ve met them, you’ve received a reasonable return on the time you’ve invested in your training and it’s safe to say that you do not suffer from fuckarounditis – even if you have some of the symptoms, remember that it’s not fucking around if what you’re doing is working for you.</p>
<p>If you have not met them, then something is amiss. And if you can’t do 8 good chin-ups or struggle with being able to bench press your body weight after a decade of working out….something is horribly amiss.</p>
<p>This is no laughing matter. I’ve had clients that spent 10-15 years working out with little or nothing to show for it and some made very basic mistakes that could have been fixed at an early stage. But as fuckarounditis took root, they seemed to only have succumbed deeper, eventually losing that last shred of training sense.</p>
<p>Taking early preventative measures is key. Where this is not possible, rapid intervention can save the situation. Enter The Fuckarounditis Test.</p>
<h2>The Fuckarounditis Test</h2>
<p>Please review these 25 common symptoms and behaviors associated with fuckarounditis. If you recognize yourself in any of these, and have not met the strength standards recently discussed, you must immediately cease the behavior and implement the necessary changes. There is no time to waste.</p>
<h3>1. You don’t keep track.</h3>
<p>How much can you bench, squat and deadlift? How many chin-ups? You need to be able to answer those questions right now. Don’t let me hear “I THINK I can” or “I’m not sure but…”. You need to know how much weight you can maximally lift in one set when you’re fresh.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a set of 1, 4 ,6 or 8 reps doesn’t matter. You need to have concrete reference points in order to evaluate your progress. Keep track of them in a training log. Not “in your head”, write it down. The single act of writing it down is more important than you think, whether you keep those data points in a notebook, on your computer or on Post-It notes like me.</p>
<p>With tracking comes the motivation to train, the results and everything else. I can’t even imagine where people get their motivation from if they don’t keep track and just choose weights at random based on whatever feels good that day.</p>
<p>You should at all times be aware of the best performance in a few key lifts, your body weight and the conditions under which those sets were performed.</p>

Phil says “The 4 to 8 rep jump is actually bigger than it sounds, since my 4 reps were done with terrible form, bouncing the weight as hard as I could, and the 8 reps were done very controlled.” That’s outstanding progress, but in order to spot it, you need to keep track. </figcaption></figure>
<h3>2. You are not methodical.</h3>
<p>The only thing that should be changing from week to week is the load on the bar or the reps with the same load you used last time. If you’re doing it right, these should be increasing. Everything else stays the same; the movements and the order you did them in, the sets and the rest periods in between sets. You don’t add in new stuff.</p>
<p>This is the only way you can fairly evaluate your progress and see if you’re headed in the right direction. It might sound tedious to keep doing the same movements every week and the appeal of “mixing it up” can seem strong.</p>
<p>However, the tediousness will soon be replaced by the much stronger joy you get from seeing your lifts go up on a weekly basis. Don’t fall for “muscle confusion” bullshit. The only ones confused are the people who keep talking about such nonsense.</p>
<p>Mixing together too much shit and being methodical about the process was one of the fuckarounditis symptoms that plagued social media expert <a href="http://inoveryourhead.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julien Smith</a>, co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470635495/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwleanga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0470635495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust Agents</a>, before I set him straight. Here’s what I told him back when he asked me to comment on his “routine” before we started working together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Summing it up, I suspect that your laughable progress can be explained by the following:</p>
<p>1. Your bullshit training routine, which is a haphazard mixture of strength and conditioning. Some people get decent results from CrossFit and the like, but it spells death for hardgainers like yourself. If we work together you will stop flopping around like a fool and start lifting heavy, with plenty of rest in between sets.</p>
<p>2. Not tracking progress, be that in some key movements like chins, bench press, etc, or benchmark CrossFit-sessions (which I use regularly for CF clients). Training whatever feels good for the moment is one of the worst ways possible to make progress, not to mention serious progress. It’s such a fucking waste of time that I was completely horrified of how you approached it all. That’s going to change if we work together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has since then gained muscle, added more than a hundred pounds to the main lifts, and has not gained an iota of body fat. I cured him with lots of food and a simple regimen of basic movements done consistently on a weekly basis.</p>
<h3>3. You don’t plan for progress.</h3>
<p>Never choose training weights at random. You look at what you used last session and make the choice based solely on that. Not on your ego. Not because you feel like trying higher or lower reps for shits and giggles.</p>
<p>There many good progression models but I will recommend two common models that I use depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Beginners and people who need a “reboot”, i.e. they may have training experience but have been fucking around so much they’re essentially at the beginner stage (e.g., I used a slightly modified SS routine for Julien), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976805421/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwleanga-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0976805421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting Strength</a> is an excellent model.</p>
<p>This is a very simple 3x/week-program with frequent training and practice of the Big Three (bench, squat and deadlift), starting at 1-3 sets of 5. Example:</p>
<p>Squat: 200 x 5 x 3.</p>
<p>When you can complete 3 sets of 5 reps with 200 lbs, resting 5 minutes between each set, increase the weight next session. The training load starts at your 7-8RM, which means that you do not go to failure initially.</p>
<p>For experienced trainers, I recommend the double progression model of <a href="https://leangains.com/reverse-pyramid-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse pyramid training</a>. This is what built most of my physique and it’s also by far the most common approach I use with <a href="http://www.leangains.com/search/label/Client%20results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clients</a>. Example:</p>
<p>Squat: 200 x 6-8 x 2.</p>
<p>Set 1: 200 x 8<br/>
Rest 3-5 mins. Reduce the load by 10% for the second set.<br/>
Set 2: 180 x 8 (however many reps you can get)</p>
<p>When the highest number in the interval (6-8) is reached (“8” in this case), increase the weight by 2.5% or 5 lbs the next session. Thus in the above example, you would use 205 and 185 lbs for your sets the next time. All sets are to be performed with maximal effort and movements are only done once a week (3x/week training frequency). “Double progression” means that you progress both in reps and load; first you hit the reps you need, then you increase the load.</p>
<p>RPT is very time-efficient. It’s also far superior to anything else I’ve tried for strength/muscle retention/muscle gain during a diet.</p>
<h3>4. You’re doing too much shit.</h3>
<p>Be a minimalist, like me.</p>
<figure>
	<img decoding="async" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z1Tuyq1LRWU/ToIM-gB74uI/AAAAAAAABTY/2MeT0o3-A7A/s800/Martin+Berkhan+Leangains.JPG" alt="Martin Berkhan — Actual body condition"/><figcaption>I snapped this yesterday and stay in this condition all year round.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I built my physique with these movements primarily: squats, deadlifts, bench presses, chin-ups, triceps extensions and calf raises. These have remained staples throughout the years. I have flirted with other movements, but these were brief periods.</p>
<p>On the whole, that’s one movement per muscle group, with the exception of abs and biceps, which I never really trained except for early in my training career, and then very sporadically every once in a while.</p>
<p>The point is that most people are doing too much shit. This dilutes the focus and effort that they are able to put into that which really delivers.</p>
<h3>5. You think more about supplements than squats.</h3>
<p>No single factor in strength training receives so much attention, yet deliver so little in return. Don’t play the fool who chases magic pills, thinking it will compensate for a lack of effort, a fundamentally flawed training routine or a poor diet.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://leangains.com/supplements-you-might-actually-find-useful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplements that you might actually find useful</a>, but they won’t turn the tide if what you’re doing right now is not working without them.</p>
<h3>6. You’re lifting weights for the calorie burn.</h3>
<p>Strength is strength. Cardio is cardio. Don’t mix, keep them separate, and use cardio sparingly on a diet or if your primary goal is strength and muscle gain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re adding 2-3 sessions of HIIT to your 3 sessions of weights, it is almost comparable to adding 2-3 days of weights. Keyword is “almost”, I’m obviously not drawing direct comparisons. That’s all fine and dandy if you think working out 5-6 days/week is a good idea on a diet. But I don’t think anyone – no matter what level of experience – needs more than 3 days a week in the gym when cutting. (Yes, this goes for competitors and beginners alike.)</p>
<p>In conclusion, if conditioning is not terribly important for you, if your goal is really about getting shredded while keeping your muscle, I highly suggest limiting moderate to high intensity cardio on a diet – or ditch it completely. Save it for some other time when your recovery is good and not limited by your diet.</p>
<p>A calorie deficit is a recovery deficit. Avoid deficit spending.</p>

That way he could put up the effort when it counted.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>7. You’re looking a bit too happy in there.</h3>
<p>If you’re not grimacing, grunting, or experiencing some sort of discomfort, you’re not training hard enough. One good set where you have to fight for the reps is better than a week of half-ass sets.</p>
<h3>8. You spend more than 5 minutes on abs.</h3>
<p>If you can’t see your abs, you need to unfatten yourself. Simple as that. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21804427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can’t spot reduce</a> and you’ll get plenty of ab work with squats, deadlifts, chin-ups and overhead presses. Let me see someone at 5-6% body fat deadlift 2.5-3 x body weight for reps with with weak abs and underdeveloped abs. It ain’t happening.</p>
<p>I’ll allow you one set of “abs”. Beyond that don’t waste your time with crunches, ab machines, hanging leg raises or whatever the hell you’re doing. It won’t give you shit and it will only suck time and energy from what you should be doing.</p>
<h3>9. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/avIzc.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Is this you?</a></h3>
<h3>10. You’re afraid of “bulky muscles” and use terms like “toning.”</h3>
<p>Women, you need to put down those pink dumbbells, throw that Shape Magazine in the trash can and stop with this nonsense. You seem to believe that the modest amount of strain will cause you to wake up looking like a bodybuilder in the morning. <i>Horseshit. </i>You’re not using enough drugs to ever come close to looking muscle bound. With the training intensity I see most women apply in the gym, they might as well skip weight training altogether and stay on the treadmill.</p>

<p>Jenn has actually gotten stronger since she shot that video; she’s now up to 27.5 lbs added weight. That’s more than 99% of the guys at my gym…and I bet it’s more than many male readers of this site as well. Her routine?</p>
<p><strong>Day 1 (Monday)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5-min walk for warm-up.</li>
<li>Deadlift 2-3 sets of 4-5 reps<a href="https://leangains.com/reverse-pyramid-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reverse pyramid style</a>.</li>
<li>Rest 5-10 mins.</li>
<li>Leg extensions – Same setup as deadlifts, but reps a bit higher (6-8).</li>
<li>Rest 5-10 mins.</li>
<li>Chins – Same as deads.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 3 (Wednesday)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5-min walk for warm-up.</li>
<li>Bench press 2-3 sets of 5-7 reps reverse pyramid style.</li>
<li>Rest 5-10 mins</li>
<li>Pull-ups 2-3 sets with body weight.</li>
<li>Rest 5-10 mins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 5 (Friday)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Squats 2-3 sets of 5-7 reps reverse pyramid style.</li>
<li>Rest 5-10 mins.</li>
<li>Walking lunges 2-3 sets same as squats.</li>
<li>Rest 5-10 mins.</li>
<li>Overhead Press 2-3 sets of 5-7 reps reverse pyramid style.</li>
<li>Rest 5-10 mins</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the routine Jenn was doing when she sent me the video and the one she gained all that strength on. This is a solid routine, regardless of gender, and it’s vastly superior to what you’re doing if you’re in the fuckarounditis camp. Why not try it and see for yourself? Throw in a set or two of curls, triceps and calves if you want but don’t mess with it beyond that.</p>
<h3>11. You’re “training the core”…and it involves a Swiss Ball, Bosu Ball or something else that makes you look like an idiot.</h3>
<p>“Training the core” is a phrase that is all too often used by people who are afraid to squat. You don’t need special movements for the core, because it comes with the territory if you squat, deadlift, press and chin. No one squats 2 x body weight with a weak core.</p>
<h3>12. You want that Tyler Durden look.</h3>
<p>Whenever I hear a client say this, alarm bells go off. There’s nothing wrong in having ideals. The problem is all the pain I feel after seeing the dumb shit that follows in the questionnaire, under the part where I ask them about their current training routine. I’ll often see some horrifying cardio/pump’n’tone hybrid, some celebrity workout variety or the kind you’d expect to see in those kind of routines. Nothing more faddish than made-up “celebrity workouts”. God damn, how I hate those.</p>
<p>Want to look like Tyler Durden? Then you need to build up some modest amount of muscle and then you need to lose fat, period. The muscle is best built with heavy weight training, not 15-25-rep set flyes followed by an hour in the pec deck machine. Your gut is best lost with a good diet, not “fat burning workouts”/tons of cardio/pump’n’tone crapola. All those will do is leave you under-muscled, weak and with a severe case of fuckarounditis.</p>

When this client told me that he was “closing in on his goal” of achieving a physique similar to that of Brad Pitt, AKA Tyler Durden in “Fight Club”, I told him to gain some fat, start smoking, get into a fight, and stop training his arms and shoulders. (The implication of that being that he had already surpassed his goal.)</figcaption></figure>
<h3>13. You’re using belts, gloves and straps for no good reason.</h3>
<p>What is your reason exactly? Don’t use equipment as a crutch.</p>
<h3>14. You avoid squats and deadlift, because you think they’ll give you a wide waist.</h3>
<p>Bitch please. Yes, squats and deadlifts will put muscle on your obliques and thicken up your lower back. But weighted chin-ups or pull-ups will give you wider lats, and if you train all these movements, your waist-to-shoulder ratio will develop very favorably. Training all these movements will also help you grow some balls, so you can finally stop making up bullshit excuses for why you shouldn’t train hard (AKA squat and deadlift).</p>
<p>Petter, the Tyler Durden lookalike, was squatting and deadlifting regularly on my routine. Last time I checked,  he was squatting 2 x body weight (300 lbs) for 9 reps. He was also close to being able to complete a one-arm pull-up. Does it look like he has a wide waist? Are my clients notable for their wide waists? Take your “wide waist”-argument/excuse and shove it up your ass right now.</p>
<p>What’s funny is that this argument is usually brought up by guys who want a “Hollywood”/underwear model type physique. They’re often a) dieting, b) not training legs and c) likely doing tons of cardio. That particular combination will strip off whatever little leg muscle they have faster than Gary Busey can do a gram of coke off his dog Chili’s back. It leaves them looking pathetic and weak, and if that sounds good to you then go ahead.</p>
<h3>15. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kav2ndhc6h8&amp;feature=relmfu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doing this?</a></h3>
<h3>16. Are you still warming up? I can’t tell.</h3>
<p>A warm-up is a warm-up. Treat it as such. It should be light, just enough to get the blood flowing and prepare the nervous system for the real stuff. It should never cause fatigue or interfere with your performance in the work sets. All the time, I see people doing sets of 10-15 reps before they get to something that remotely resembles their real set. Which is completely retarded, because you will be fatigued and glycogen-depleted, and your performance in the work sets will be limited for metabolic reasons, and not limited by your actual strength.</p>
<p>The only standing recommendation I have regarding warm-ups is for compound movements: 1-3 sets of 4-6 reps of 40%-80% of target weight for the first work set. Warm-ups for assistance movements is whatever you feel is needed. Personally, I only warm up for squats, deadlift, bench press and chins. If you do these at the start of your workout, which you should, you’ll find that they usually get your whole body warmed up, which makes warm-ups redundant or entirely unnecessary for the rest of the workout.</p>
<h3>17. Are you still warming up? I can’t tell. What’s that? You’re already done and I can take the bench?</h3>
<p>Let’s see some fucking effort next time. Don’t take up precious space here when you can get a better workout from walking your dog through the park outside.</p>
<p>You can be doing everything perfectly, but you will not go anywhere if you’re not willing to experience discomfort on a regular basis. If you’re in the gym 5-6 days a week, lack of effort might actually be the explanation for your lack of progress. If you were actually in there training hard, most people wouldn’t be coming back for more 5-6 days a week.</p>
<h3>18. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Martinberkhan/status/110765599117934592" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Was this you?</a> <a href="https://leangains.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/squat-meme.jpg" target="_blank">🖼️</a></h3>
<p>Learn good form early, so you don’t have to pay for it with injuries and shitty results later down the road. Don’t let your ego screw you and don’t slap on weight indiscriminately. Be methodical and patient.</p>
<p>No need to be a form nazi either. People who “practice” form in all eternity are sometimes just afraid to train hard. Striving for picture perfect form on your final reps can be counterproductive when taken to the extreme.</p>
<h3>19. Your workout buddy gets a set of barbell rows on the house when he “spots” you benching.</h3>
<p>Tell him to keep his fingers off the damn bar and assist you as little as possible and only when it’s truly needed; meaning only if you are about to fail on the very last rep in the set. Don’t be one of those clowns slapping on twice of what they could lift by themselves to stroke their ego. It looks pathetic and it will make it impossible for you to properly evaluate your progress.</p>
<p>And for me, an unwanted spotter can make it hard to evaluate the progress of the client, like I had to explain to this actor/client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am your trainer, the guy who follows you around is only there to make sure your form is not completely retarded. His function right now should be redundant. I assume you know how to perform most movements well by now. If he interferes with your sets, he is counterproductive to the outcome.</p>
<p>You’re my only client right now with a personal trainer on top of the help you receive from me. I imagine he is eager to “correct” your form and tinker with your training in any way he can in order to not feel useless. Make sure he stays out of it beyond spotting you on some sets where it’s warranted (i.e. when and if you are about to fail). Some PTs can’t even get that part right and goes way overboard with the helping part.</p>
<p>This is another danger of having him around, as it gets impossible for me to measure your progress (strength gains) accurately (i.e. did you gain strength since the last session or did he just help you more this time?). Make it very clear to him when and how he should help (last rep you can’t complete by yourself).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This actor played a key role in an award winning and Oscar-nominated movie last year. I’m preparing him for a new movie with some very big names that start shooting early next year. I can’t tell you more beyond that, but rest assured that his “celebrity workout” does not include mickey mouse curls supersetted with cable flyes, or anything of the usual variety you read about in magazines.</em></p>
<h3>20. You obsess about “tempo”.</h3>
<p>Forget about tempo. Tempo takes care of itself if you’re working with heavy weights (80% 1RM / 8 reps or less), because your control over the load is very limited. Lift the damn weight, repeat, it’s that simple. Don’t overthink it.</p>
<p>Tempo was hot stuff a few years ago and frequently discusses in articles an on the boards. It seems to have slipped off the radar now. Why? Because it’s yet another distraction from the important stuff.</p>
<h3>21. You’re into “functional” training.</h3>
<p>But you can’t squat body weight and your “functional” muscle mass is non-existent. Unless you’re an athlete with a very good reason, stay the hell away from anything that involves Swiss Balls, balance boards or pogo sticks.</p>
<h3>22. You’re the guy who sent me these two direct messages 5 minutes <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Martinberkhan/status/117312320035749889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after I tweeted this</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>do you think 8×20 abs is enough ?? i do hanging superstrict..really feel working lower abs!!. also i need bcaa if i situps in fasted state??</p>
<p>also how much bcaa u recommend</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>23. You’re working on your “lagging biceps”, but you can’t even do 8 chin-ups with good form.</h3>
<p>First of all, you’re weak and fat. Second of all, body part specialization has its place, but it’s always the ones least qualified that are doing it. Worry about body part specialization after you achieve the major goalposts involving the muscle group that lags behind. Until then, body part specialization is a distraction that will interfere with your development as a whole.</p>
<p>Let’s see if your chest and your shoulders are lagging once you can bench 1.5 x body weight or overhead press your body weight and if your legs and back are lagging with a 2 x body weight squat and 2.5 x body weight deadlift. Keep doing targeted work for muscle groups like triceps, hams and calves.</p>
<p>Yes, you can keep a few sets of curls in there, but 2-3 sets is enough for now. Do you really think your guns will be lagging once you’re doing chin-ups with 100 lbs hanging from your waist? My clients have told me they saw more biceps growth from the increased focus on weighted chin-ups than any amount of curls they did in the past. I never spent any time on curls and they grew just fine from all those chin-ups. I can say for damn sure you’ll put on a good deal of size on your arms if you add 50 lbs to whatever you can chin-up right now.</p>
<p>Ask Paul Wilson and his 8 reps with 110 lbs of solid chin-up mastery:<br/>

<h3>24. You think ripped abs will get you laid.</h3>
<p>I hate to bust your bubble lil’ buddy, but women don’t give a shit beyond a guy looking reasonably fit. Lower than 10-12% body fat won’t make an ounce of a difference. If women is your main motivation for dieting, don’t bother getting shredded. Women have similar delusions in terms of thinking men like them super-skinny.</p>
<p>Training to be liked by others is a very poor motivational factor in itself. You need internal motivation, not external. No one that ends up making something out of his or hers physique, something impressive and head-turning, gets there by training to get liked by others. It might have started out as such, but it changes. I think this quote sums up why and how we make it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to discipline yourself, and through this discipline will come some level of achievement, and from this achievement will come your pride.</p>
<cite>David Lee Roth.</cite></blockquote>
<p>And then there’s the fact that nothing beats the feeling you get from breaking a new personal record. Some of the happiest moments I remember are from walking home after a new 20-rep squat record way back in the days. Walking up stairs was like being repeatedly stabbed with a blunt and rusty butterknife. But it was still pure bliss.</p>
<h3>25. You have all kinds of elaborate excuses for why you don’t need to squat and deadlift.</h3>
<p>You get your leg training from playing soccer, you’re afraid you might hurt your back, you read somewhere that single-leg training is better, you talk about rear-foot elevated split squats with a 45-degree twist during the concentric being the future of leg training, etc. Horseshit, all of it.</p>
<p>Listen carefully. Squats and deadlifts are undisputably the two best full body movements in the god damn Universe and that’s reason enough to be doing them.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story. Their true greatness lies in the mental fortitude they foster if you train them hard and consistently. This will benefit your training as a whole and leave echoes in your life outside the gym.</p>
<p>Did I miss something? Well, I actually left a few signs and symptoms out because this article was getting way too long for my own good and it feels like my eyes are bleeding right now. I thought I’d leave it up to you to finish it.</p>

		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SkipLists often come up when discussing “obscure” data-structures but in reality they are not that obscure, in fact many of the production grade softwares actively use them. In this post I’ll try to go into SkipLists by describing how to make a toy implementation, potential optimizations and real world use cases of them. So what are SkipLists anyway? Well, SkipList are referential data structures inspired from linked list and binary trees. They are collection of sort linked list arranged in different levels, where levels are designed in such a way that it allows skipping nodes to get a logarithmic complexity when searching for the keys later. They are alternative to binary trees and even in some cases the legendary B-Tree, in fact last level of SkipList looks somewhat like a B+Tree. SkipLists perform very well with random write heavy workloads where ordered storage or fast lookup is required. Construction of level(s) is probabilistic in nature, thus these lists can be vulnerable to becoming unbalanced if underlying random algorithm isn’t uniform enough. These are also typically a lot easier to implement compared to HashMaps and Trees which make them ideal for an alternative choice specially if only in memory lookup is required. Why would you wanna use SkipLists? For one, lookup, deletion and insertion has logarithmic complexity. Secondly these are relatively very easy to implement as you don’t need to take care of rebalancing tree (as with RB Trees, AVL Trees, B+Trees) or container resizing (as with HashMaps). Thirdly, thread safe implementation is also not too complex, there are lock and lock-free concurrent implemetations out there and memory footprint is generally low when compared to other ordered collection.</p><p>Let’s try to take a peek at SkipList with a diagram.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3x1vmVs.png" alt="SkipList"/></p><p>This diagram essentially represents a collection of linked list data-structure organized in sorted order of the keys. There are different levels, which contain subset of elements from previous level in sorted order. This might depend on implementation but usually there are no multiple copies of same node but it’s just a way to represent same node across different levels. For example in the diagram, <code>Node 5</code> which is present in all 3 levels connects to <code>Node 24, Node 15, Node 7</code> . It may appear that it has multiple copies but it’s the same node with multiple connections for different levels.</p><p>For the implementation, I’ll be using Go with generics because I have been wanting to use them for a while now and there’s no better use case than having a generic type safe collection. Using generic often requires constraints or traits (as rustaceans say) and I couldn’t find the constraints to enforce order in the standard library so I used <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/constraints">golang.org/x/exp/constraints</a> package which gives us <code>Ordered</code> constraint which will give us a way to compare and keep them sorted them in our SkipList.</p><h2 id="structures">Structures</h2><p>Let’s define a struct to store key and value for the individual node</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Record</span>[<span>K</span> <span>constraints</span>.<span>Ordered</span>, <span>V</span> <span>any</span>] <span>struct</span> {

}
</code></pre></div><p>Note that <code>forward[i]</code> represents next member of the list at <code>i th</code> level. In the above diagram, for example, <code>forward[0]</code> for <code>Node 5</code> will have pointer to <code>Node 7</code>, <code>forward[1]</code> to <code>Node 15</code> and <code>forward[2]</code> to <code>Node 24</code></p><p>Once we have these structs, we can define constructor functions to help us quickly build the struct</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>NewRecord</span>[<span>K</span> <span>constraints</span>.<span>Ordered</span>, <span>V</span> <span>any</span>](<span>key</span> <span>K</span>, <span>value</span> <span>V</span>) *<span>Record</span>[<span>K</span>, <span>V</span>] {

Finally to construct the SkipList, we can write the function as following</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>NewSkipList</span>[<span>K</span> <span>constraints</span>.<span>Ordered</span>, <span>V</span> <span>any</span>]() *<span>SkipList</span>[<span>K</span>, <span>V</span>] {

Algorithm can be summarized as following</p><ul><li>Start looking for your key from the top level of the SkipList.</li><li>Keep moving forward in the same level as long as key is smaller than what you’re looking for.</li><li>If you happen to find the key, return it’s value.</li><li>If next key is bigger than your target key then start looking in the level below.</li></ul><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> (<span>s</span> *<span>SkipList</span>[<span>K</span>, <span>V</span>]) <span>Find</span>(<span>key</span> <span>K</span>) (<span>V</span>, <span>bool</span>) {

First one is the which figures out the level for the new node. In our implementation we’re using naive probabilistic approach which is using random function to choose levels, where probability of level is <code>2^(-L+1)</code>. This works for the most part and is very simple to implement but it’s efficiency depends on how good the random function is. It may very well always choose level 0. Ideally what we want from the SkipList is to have half the number of nodes than level below it to take the full advantage of the binary search.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> (<span>s</span> *<span>SkipList</span>[<span>K</span>, <span>V</span>]) <span>getRandomLevel</span>() <span>int</span> {

   }  
   <span>return</span> <span>level</span>  
}  
</code></pre></div><p>Second one is <code>adjustLevel</code>, this method takes care of increasing the SkipList head’s forward pointer array size to be able to hold pointer for new levels, in case new node’s level is going to be greater than what SkipList currently contains. We don’t really care what Key Value we store in head node’s records, this the reason why I am just storing the zero value in there by <code>*new(K), *new(V)</code>. I can also store nil pointers but this will do.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> (<span>s</span> *<span>SkipList</span>[<span>K</span>, <span>V</span>]) <span>adjustLevel</span>(<span>level</span> <span>int</span>) {

Most modern CPU tries to predict which memory is going to be used in the future. Most common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_prefetching">algorithm</a> is that it assumes program is going to ask for big chunk of contiguous data (like an array) so it tries to load contiguous memory blocks into the cache lines as predicted, but linked list nodes are not necessarily contiguous which will cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)">trashing in the CPU cache</a> because only few blocks would be relevant, rest of the space would be wasted as the next node can be in completely different chunk of memory. Arrays fit best in L1 cache but with linked list there’s no guarantee that next node will fit into that or even L2 or L3 which is dependent on how good is memory allocator.</p><p>If we look at the latency numbers in the following diagram, it gives us clear picture how bad performance can be with if there’s too frequent cache miss. This implies accessing different nodes in a list can be upto 100-200x times slow compared to accessing next element in an array.</p><p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a7jWu.png" alt="Latency"/></p><h3 id="using-a-shared-memory-allocator">Using a shared memory allocator</h3><p>Bane of the problem with SkipLists or LinkedList in general is the memory access pattern which is cache unfriendly. Let’s take a look on how efficient allocation can help us improve the performance.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xpLwIY2.png" alt="Allocation"/></p><p>Memory allocation can take 3 forms which can be seen in above diagram</p><p>(1) Is when allocator assigns randomly spread blocks of memory.
(2) Is when allocator assigns blocks of memory which are contiguous but not necessary in correct order of list pointers.
(3) Is when allocator assigns blocks of memory which are contiguous and in line with the list access pattern.</p><p>There’s a good chance that memory allocated for naive implementation might look like something like (1) which basically represents chunks of memory spread all over the place. Any access to next node of the List is going to be cache unfriendly. If we’re using a memory pool or a shared allocator we can have something like (2). All the memory for the nodes can be allocated from a dedicated block of memory. This increases the data cache hit rate and TLB cache hit rate. (3) is what we want in ideal situation but then implementation can be very complicated specially with delete operation.</p><p>Some programming languages make it easy to replace the memory allocator like C++ and Rust, This however is tricky with Go. This can be done with <a href="https://dgraph.io/blog/post/manual-memory-management-golang-jemalloc/">manual memory management</a> and using a custom memory pool.</p><h2 id="using-unrolled-skiplist">Using unrolled SkipList</h2><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j1gAenm.png" alt="unrolled"/></p><p>Unrolled SkipList is one which stores multiple elements in each node. Unrolling is designed to give a better cache performance which can depend on the size of the objects which are accessed. These variants can “waste” extra space as each node allocates memory for the array which may not be occupied all the time. Delete operation can be tricky as it creates “gaps” in the node array. Searching is very similar to skip list, and when a candidate is found, the array is searched through linear search. To insert, you push to the array. If no excessive space is available, the insertion happens by adding a new SkipList node.</p><h2 id="keeping-track-of-elements-at-each-levels">Keeping track of elements at each levels</h2><p>I talked briefly about this while describing one of the helper methods. In my implementation level determination is pretty much non-deterministic and based on probabilties but problem is that, if there’s a bad random function there’s a good chance we end up creating unbalanced SkipList. Unbalanced meaning, one of the levels having too many nodes than ideally required. So in order to make search performance as fast as possible, a smart implementation should ensure that a level has only half the elements of the previous level. Which allows best “skipping” while looking up a key. Ofcourse actively balancing can degrade the insert and delete performance so there needs to be a proper balance.</p><p>SkipLists are not very common when compared to say balanced trees or hashtables but once in a while you do run into them. Personally I have seen them only at the following places but I am pretty sure this is just anecdotal and if you look you can find it at more common places.</p><h2 id="rocksdb">RocksDB</h2><p>RocksDB is an embeddable persistent key-value store for fast storage. RocksDB can also be the foundation for a client-server database, one of the most popular database using it these days is CockroachDB. RocksDB is built on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">LevelDB</a> to be scalable to run on servers with multicore CPU, to efficiently use fast storage, to support IO-bound, in-memory and write-once workloads. Internally, RocksDB uses LSM Trees for storage and implementation needs a Memtable to store sorted keys in the memory before it’s flushed into the disk in the form of SST files. One of the implemtation of Memtable in RocksDB is done by SkipList in RocksDB. New writes always insert data to memtable, and reads has to query memtable before reading from SST files, because data in memtable is newer.</p><p>Skiplist-based memtable provides general good performance to both read and write, random access and sequential scan. Besides, it provides some other useful features that other memtable implementations don’t currently support, like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/MemTable#concurrent-insert">Concurrent Insert</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/MemTable#insert-with-hint">Insert with Hint</a>.</p><h2 id="redis-sortedset">Redis SortedSet</h2><p>Redis Sorted Sets are similar to Sets with the feature that members are stored with user defined values. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1171423">To quote Antirez</a>, it was chosen over balanced trees because</p><blockquote><ol><li>They are not very memory intensive. It’s up to you basically. Changing parameters about the probability of a node to have a given number of levels will make then <em>less</em> memory intensive than btrees.</li><li>A sorted set is often target of many ZRANGE or ZREVRANGE operations, that is, traversing the skip list as a linked list. With this operation the cache locality of skip lists is at least as good as with other kind of balanced trees.</li><li>They are simpler to implement, debug, and so forth. For instance thanks to the skip list simplicity I received a patch (already in Redis master) with augmented skip lists implementing ZRANK in O(log(N)). It required little changes to the code.</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id="muqss-linux-scheduler">MuQSS Linux Scheduler</h2><p>Con Kolivas maintains a series of scheduler patch sets that he has tuned considerably over the years for his own use, focusing primarily on latency reduction for a better desktop experience. <a href="http://ck-hack.blogspot.my/2016/10/muqss-multiple-queue-skiplist-scheduler.html">In early October 2016</a>, Kolivas updated the design of his popular desktop scheduler patch set, which he renamed MuQSS.

<p>If you’ve ever owned a software system, be it a web site, a web service, or even a scheduled job, you have likely had to define the availability of your system in order to set expectations with your users and customers. </p>



<p>Availability is commonly defined in terms uptime and is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year. When a system is unavailable to a client or customer, the period of unavailability is called downtime. As such, uptime and downtime are related as per the equation below:</p>


<h5><strong>100% – downtime = uptime</strong></h5>


<p>While service availability can be expressed in terms of a percentage of uptime, it has become commonplace to use a few special percentages when discussing the availability of HA (<strong>high availability</strong>) systems and services. We refer to these special percentages as “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability" target="_blank">nines of availability</a>“.</p>



<p>Here are some examples:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Availability %<br/></strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Downtime per year</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Downtime per month</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Downtime per week</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Downtime per day (24 hours)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>90% </strong><br/><strong>(“1 nine”)</strong></td><td data-align="center">36.53 days</td><td data-align="center">73.05 hours</td><td data-align="center">16.80 hours</td><td data-align="center">2.40 hours</td></tr><tr><td><strong>99% </strong><br/><strong>(“2 nines”)</strong></td><td data-align="center">3.65 days</td><td data-align="center">7.31 hours</td><td data-align="center">1.68 hours</td><td data-align="center">14.40 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>99.9% </strong><br/><strong>(“3 nines”)</strong></td><td data-align="center">8.77 hours</td><td data-align="center">43.83 minutes</td><td data-align="center">10.08 minutes</td><td data-align="center">1.44 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>99.95% </strong><br/><strong>(“3.5 nines”)</strong></td><td data-align="center">4.38 hours</td><td data-align="center">21.92 minutes</td><td data-align="center">5.04 minutes</td><td data-align="center">43.20 seconds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>99.99% </strong><br/><strong>(“4 nines”)</strong></td><td data-align="center">52.60 minutes</td><td data-align="center">4.38 minutes</td><td data-align="center">1.01 minutes</td><td data-align="center">8.64 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>etc…</td><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center"></td><td data-align="center"></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Service Availability Table</figcaption></figure>



<p>For example, if you wanted to calculate the downtime allowed for a system with 1 nine of availability, you would do the following:</p>



<pre><code><h6><strong><em>uptime = 0.9</em>
<em>downtime = 1 - uptime = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1</em>
<em>hours_in_a_day = 24h</em>
<em>downtime_allowed_per_day = 24h * 0.1 = 2.4h</em></strong></h6></code></pre>


<p>Thus, 2.4 hours of downtime would be allowed for a one-nines system — c.f. the corresponding entry in the table above.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Scheduled vs Unscheduled Downtimes</strong></p>
<p>Scheduled downtimes can be events like software releases or system upgrades (<strong>e.g. database upgrades</strong>). In today’s world, there is very little need for scheduled downtimes — this is a solved problem in modern software architectures. Unscheduled downtimes are outages. While it is possible to minimize outages, it is not possible to fully eradicate them.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>SLAs and Scheduled Downtimes</strong></p>
<p>One common question that arises when discussing Service Level Agreements (<strong>a.k.a. SLAs</strong>) for system availability is whether or not special periods (<strong>e.g. scheduled downtimes or maintenance windows</strong>) are excluded from the uptime SLA calculation. </p>
<p>If a service or system is undergoing scheduled maintenance, is that scheduled period exempt from the uptime calculation? For example, an uptime service SLA might look like the following:</p>


<pre><code><h6><strong>Uptime SLA
</strong>* 3 nines, measured at 1 minute granularity, honored daily
* Exclusions 
  * Weekly releases &amp; upgrades lasting 2 hours (7p UTC - 9p UTC)</h6></code></pre>


<p>While this may be acceptable in some cases, there are issues with it. If you own a service or system, it is quite likely that your clients (<strong>i.e. other software systems</strong>) have Uptime SLAs to uphold with clients of their own.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that your service <strong>Service_A</strong> has a client which is <strong>Service_B</strong>, which in turn has a client which is <strong>Service_C</strong>, and so on as shown below.</p>

<p>As you can imagine from the diagram above, it is undesirable to exclude maintenance windows from uptime SLAs as it can violate SLAs that your customers already have in place with their customers, and so forth. Additionally, it can cause a chain-reaction in terms of operational overhead for each service in this chain as each one will need to go into maintenance mode when <strong>Service_A</strong> starts its maintenance window!</p>



<p>It is more desirable that your availability % includes both scheduled and unscheduled downtimes so that it is easier for your customers to reason about availability. Furthermore, since it is possible to avoid scheduled downtimes altogether by architecting your service for high availability, your uptime SLAs only need to reflect the probability of outages &amp; your readiness to deal with them.   </p>



<p>Our newly-revised Uptime SLA will look as show below :</p>



<pre><code><h6><strong>Uptime SLA
</strong>* 3 nines, measured at 1 minute granularity, honored daily</h6></code></pre>

<p><strong>Measuring &amp; Monitoring Availability</strong></p>

<p>Now that we know what an uptime SLA should look like, how do we measure it?</p>

<p><strong>Service Architecture</strong></p>

<p>Before we tackle this, let us first assume a generic software service <strong>Service_A</strong> and a client service <strong>Service_B</strong> as shown below.</p>

<div><p>In this example, each service is itself composed of multiple micro-services. For example, in <strong>Service_A</strong>, the green microservice (a.k.a. <em>µs</em>) is an API or Edge service that implements the public APIs of <strong>Service_A</strong>. When called, the green <em>µs</em> calls a yellow <em>µs</em>, which in turn calls both orange and red <em>µs</em>es. Each microservice within Service_A is replicated to increase availability of the entire system supporting <strong>Service_A</strong>.</p><p><strong>Service_B</strong> is likewise composed of multiple microservices, one of which calls <strong>Service_A’s</strong> public endpoint. <strong>Service_B</strong> does not see all of the microservices running within <strong>Service_A</strong>. It only sees a DNS domain name and an API spec that may be exposed via Swagger.</p></div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Service Protocols</strong></p>

<p>For illustration’s sake, let us assume a request-response model between services : <strong>Service_B</strong> sends a REST request to <strong>Service_A</strong> and awaits a response. <strong>Service_B</strong> will wait a configured amount of time for a response to be returned from <strong>Service_A</strong> — let’s say 5 seconds — after which it will either retry or count the request as a failure!</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Measuring Availability</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have a straw man architecture, we next need to define a metric for availability of our system!</p>

<p>For REST APIs, one common way to measure availability is to record response counts by HTTP response code. For example, let’s count the number of response codes the Service_A returns in any 1-minute-wide window. For the example below, let’s say that the response code distribution for 13:00 UTC is as shown below:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Response Codes</strong></td><td><strong>Count</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2xx</td><td>1,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>3xx</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>4xx</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr><td>5xx</td><td>1,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Next, we need to define “downtime”. One common approach is to calculate the percentage of 2xx response codes to non-2xx response codes as shown below for:</p>



<pre><code>2xx_count = 1,000,000
non_2xx_count = 0 + 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000
non_2xx_% = 100*(5,000/1,000,000) = 0.5% </code></pre>



<p>If the expectation from a customer is that non_2xx_% is never &gt; 0, then any minute in which the non_2xx response code percentage exceeds 0% is considered an outage from the perspective of the customer. In other words, the 13:00 UTC minute in our examples is considered an <strong>outage minute</strong>. </p>



<p>There are 1,440 minutes in a day. In order to meet a 3-nines availability SLA, we can only allow 1.4 minutes of downtime per hour where downtime is any minute with less than 100% 2xx response codes returned by the API. This calculation is illustrated below. </p>



<pre><code>3_9s_avail_% = 99.9%
3_9s_avail_decimal = 0.999
3_9s_avail_daily = 0.999 * 1400 = 1398.6 minutes
3_9s_downtime_daily = 0.001 * 1400 = 1.4 minutes  </code></pre>


<hr/>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With this general framework in hand, stay tuned for upcoming articles on how we measure availability in streaming systems and also how we maximize availability in modern data streaming systems. </p>
