<p>My post before this was a kind of therapy / Buddhism / personal growth kind of deal, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about how to run effective teams and to be a responsible, thoughtful manager of people. It is my work: I am a lead engineer at Bungie, an independent video game developer of about 300 employees (though not for long, we’re <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.bungie.net/inside/content_viewer.aspx?link=about_careers">growing</a>.) There are some unique aspects to making videogames, and I’ll use game development terminology here as I refer to, say, texture artists or sound designers or programmers, but when I talk to friends in different creative industries – film, industrial design, other software development – I find these themes are pretty universal.</p>
<p>If you’re going to manage people, you’re going to have a lot of conversations about employee performance. It’s just bound to happen. Sometimes, like during reviews, it might seem excessive. You might wonder if’s worth all the time it takes. <b>It is.</b> It’s OK that you spend a bunch of time on this. As a manager, that is your job. It’s your job to have well-formed opinions about how you evaluate people and how you work with them to help them grow. If you aren’t spending time on that, then you may be succeeding as a leader, but probably not as a manager. Apples and oranges.</p>
<p>It is, however, important to spend this time well. During conversations about performance, everything you talk about should boil down to one thing: <b>the value they contribute to the team</b>. What is their value, and how can they become more valuable?</p>
<p>I find a lot of review conversations tend to focus on strengths, weaknesses, and specific work results. These seem like reasonable topics, and there’s value there, but I also find this often leads to a review that looks like this:</p>
<p> <span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/review8bppc5a855a36635296d82ea7f54be636477.png"/></span></p>
<p>I like to call this the “D&amp;D Character Sheet” model of professional evaluation. You could literally do that, if you wanted, and it would look something like this:</p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/dndreview8bpp84aeae2805c9c89855b37998898c59e7.png"/></span></p>
<p>The D&amp;D Character Sheet model implies that a team member’s value is some kind of average of their strengths and weaknesses, maybe a weighted average because if they’re really especially strong at one thing, then maybe they’re a rare commodity and that’s especially valuable.</p>
<p>This is not a good measure of their value to the team. It’s not like you start a project and the challenge is to hire people until your stat bars all add up past some number and then you win. Project development isn’t Voltron.</p>
<p>When you start a project, the challenge is there’s a big set of work and you have to do it all. It includes the obvious work like actually typing code and making art assets and the like, but it also includes doing the prototypes you need to make creative and technical decisions. It includes building and tracking schedules. It includes putting out a bunch of inevitable fires. It includes all the one-on-one meetings of managers with their reports. Yes, there’s wiggle room in what works ends up getting done, depending on how well you make your decisions and how responsible you are, but the vast bulk of the work is getting done or you’re not shipping. Let’s say the set of all that work looks like this:</p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/WholeProject8bpp211b1e077958182f3c886f50d6e5b45a.png"/><br/></span></p>
<p>Every person on your team occupies a shape on this diagram, because all this work gets done by someone. For example, if you’re making a videogame that requires a bunch of textures and you hire a junior artist and he spends the project painting a bunch of those textures, his role might look like this:<br/><span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/TextureArtist8bpp5cf6b583269d0edf77bf9068e3582a4a.png"/><br/></span></p>
<p>His role is clear, easy to describe, and has a clean boundary. And if you have enough textures to keep 6 artists busy, that’d look like this:<br/><span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/SixArtists8bpp2eed36e1871a56224de10a6259c8f914.png"/><br/></span></p>
<p>Then you have an associate producer to help coordinate those artists, doing a bunch of legwork and catching things related to the texture-authoring that falls through the cracks. Maybe he looks like this:<br/><span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/AssocProd6e30e7b0323bd1a1ea119978791b3721.png"/><br/></span></p>
<p>The set of all of them makes a nice, clean space, which makes sense because they fill a clear, understood role as a team in the project.</p>
<p>As you get more senior, maybe you’re a specialist, so your shape gets bigger and the boundary remains nice and clear. Or you end up as a lead, and you’re able to fill spaces in the project and pick up slack that few others can, so your boundary gets messier:<br/><span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/ProgrammerSpecialistLead8bppf1fb14afbe0e4f47a655e5fde707b780.png"/></span></p>
<p>I’m not saying you can actually draw a specific chart for any real project. This is more of a conceptual thing. But I like having this conversation because I think it gets closer than the D&amp;D Character Sheet to the truth of employee value. We can talk about what your shape is, conceptually, and what work is nearby you that you aren’t covering. We can talk about whether we should make any changes to your shape. We’re all only human so over our careers our shapes don’t actually grow all that much, maybe we get two or three times more productive, but what really changes is we gain the ability to do work we couldn’t do before. There are areas our shapes can cover only when we become more senior. We can talk about that, too: is there work you are uniquely qualified to do that would be more valuable to the team than something you’re doing now?</p>
<p>The shape metaphor is also useful to me when talking about dysfunction. It has helped me understand a pattern I’ve seen and experienced several times in my career, one that initially baffled me:</p>
<p>Consider Nick and his manager Gloria. (Neither of them are real people. I’m making this up.) Nick is working hard and excited about everything he’s getting done. He feels like he’s doing the best work of his career, cranking out tons of great stuff, going way above and beyond the call of duty. It feels great and he can’t wait for reviews when Gloria will recognize all his effort and contribution.</p>
<p>Until one day, in one of their one-on-ones, Gloria gives Nick a thin-lipped smile and takes a deep breath and tells him that he’s underperforming.</p>
<p>The first thing Nick feels is shock and disbelief. Underperforming? Is this really happening? Then he feels anger: anger at Gloria for not seeing things the way he does. How could she be so blind to all his hard work? Then he feels dejected that his manager’s view of him is so far from his own, and then there’s the wave of self-doubt: maybe his best just isn’t good enough, or maybe this team will just never value his strengths and he’ll have to move on. Resignation starts to set in.</p>
<p>Gloria is just as frustrated, because try as she might to explain what she sees as very basic responsibilities Nick is dropping, it doesn’t seem to stick. All around her things are suffering because of Nick’s negligence, but the message just doesn’t seem to get through to him. When she suggests specifics that he could work on, Nick reacts with exasperation. To him, it seems Gloria is just piling time-consuming minutiae on top of the real, significant contributions already taking up all his time.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, that’s because it happens a lot.</p>
<p>The root problem is that Nick has a bad shape but he doesn’t know it. If Nick is junior, this is entirely Gloria’s fault: it should be possible to explicitly detail out exactly what is expected from a junior employee, with no room for ambiguity.</p>
<p>But at higher levels, there’s just too much to spell it all out. It’s important to try, to define boundaries for that shape so you have some way to talk about them, but you can’t capture all of it in full detail. It relies on a mutual understanding about <b>implied work</b>.</p>
<p>Some work yields knowledge that you need to do other work, and so a viable role that does one of these things must do the other. If you’re in charge of writing some code, you also have to comment it, because if you don’t, nobody else will understand it well enough to do it for you. If you’re in charge of coming up with a creative direction for a project, you also need to communicate it outwards to others, because if you don’t, nobody else knows enough to do it for you.</p>
<p>This is Nick’s problem: he is excitedly performing an incomplete role, doing some work very well but in a way that leaves other necessary work undone that nobody else can effectively do. Nick has a bad shape.<br/><span><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20121021/BadShapes8bpp73dd56549978dc5ab7aea77bda79a5f9.png"/></span></p>
<p>Worse yet, Nick’s colleagues and even Gloria didn’t immediately realize he had a bad shape. They saw him doing some of the work in one of those circles and assumed he’d take care of the whole circle, because anything less wouldn’t make sense. The sliver of the circle he wasn’t doing went unnoticed for a long time, which made the damage worse. By the time Gloria caught on, it was because something was on fire.</p>
<p>If everyone else can see the problem, and Nick’s a smart guy, how is he missing it?</p>
<p>These diagrams I’m drawing fundamentally express project development as a <b>subtractive</b> process: you start with a mountain of stuff to get done, and by the time you’re done, someone will have done all of it. These diagrams visualize the abstract notion that there’s “all the work” and each person subtracts some of it from the space, and you’re done when everything has been subtracted.</p>
<p>But not all work is subtractive. Consider a factory worker assembling cars. If he assembles 2 cars in a day, he makes the company a profit; if he works harder and assembles 4 cars in a day, he makes the company twice as much. This is an <b>additive</b> sort of work. You can do the same work, but just more of it, and you generate more value.</p>
<p>Creative endeavors are not additive. They are iterative, convergent processes, and so they are subtractive: you work until you have converged, and then you stop.</p>
<p>Nick doesn’t understand that his shape is bad because <b>he’s not thinking of his work as subtractive</b>: he’s thinking of it as additive.</p>
<p>I’ve been in Nick’s shoes before. I began my career thinking of my work as additive. “I’m contributing value,” I thought, “Because I’m writing them this amazing code.” If they criticized me for not doing something else, it made me a bit indignant. How dare they? Didn’t they realize how valuable my addition to the project was?</p>
<p>But it wasn’t an addition. It was a subtraction, just one bit of work from the huge space of work yet to be done. I couldn’t see the bigger picture. I didn’t see all the work that went along naturally with my coding work. Writing that code earned me knowledge that could have given me foresight into future challenges the project would face. If I’d bothered to think about it, I could have communicated those challenges to others and helped develop solutions. It never even occurred to me to do that, but from my manager’s perspective it was obvious that I should: it had to get done, and I was the only one who could do it. I didn’t do it, so it didn’t get done, so the project suffered.</p>
<p>You can’t truly be a senior employee until you see your work as subtractive, and until you have an intuitive feel for the set of all the work that needs to get done. Once you think in this way, you can interact with any other leader as a peer, working elbow-to-elbow, of one mind on what needs doing. <i>Until </i>you think in this way, without even realizing it, you are implicitly asking for those above you to insulate you from reality, to build you a little sandbox where you can work.</p>
<p>Nick’s situation happens all the time. I can think of two major times in my career it’s happened to me, and many times more than that I’ve seen it happen to others. It’s a tough challenge for a manager: Without extreme care, this situation ends with an offended employee carrying a lasting grudge on his way out the door and a frustrated manager left wondering why the employee just never seemed to “get it.”</p>
<p>To all employees I’d say this: when you talk to your manager, make it a point to understand her perspective on how the project needs to come together. Ask, “What do you pay attention to?” “Where do you get your information?” “What do you think the ‘pulse’ of the team is – and what makes you say so?” “What are you concerned about?” “What’s the lay of the land, as you see it?” “How is this all going to fit together?”</p>
<p>And to managers, I’d say: when you talk to your reports, help them think about their work and everyone’s work as subtractive, as cutting out shapes from the big space of all work. Tell them what things are clearly theirs, and talk about those with whom they share boundaries, and what those boundaries should be. Talk about imperatives: tell them what kinds of problems you foresee and what roles you see them playing in the solutions. Talk about the whole project, even the stuff they’d never otherwise hear about – <b>especially</b> that stuff. Give them context. Talk about convergence. Help them see their shapes.</p>

  <p id="78wwwn">Chris Voss had only been an FBI hostage negotiator for a year and a half when he was assigned to handle negotiations for a bank hostage at Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn in 1993. About 90 minutes after first picking up the phone with one of the hostage takers, Voss had struck a deal and was able to convince the kidnappers to leave the bank. Voss credits his success to non-adversarial confrontation and building trust.</p>
<p id="9zUonC">“In any negotiation — business, personal — you have to find a way to gently show people reality,” says Voss, who <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation">teaches a Masterclass on negotiation</a>, “without them feeling cornered or attacked.”</p>
<p id="fZCYtL">The stakes in most other negotiations are far lower than Voss’s brush with hostage captors. <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/9/29/13096310/wage-gap-women-negotiate-lean-in">Asking for a raise</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23161444/splitting-home-chores-unfair-equitable">splitting chore duties</a>, suggesting a different restaurant for date night — practically anything is negotiable. “It’s just not always worthwhile for us to try, and we’re not always going to be successful,” says <a href="https://www.zoechance.com/">Zoe Chance</a>, a senior lecturer at the Yale School of Management, “but anyone should be able to ask anyone for anything.”</p>
<p id="T2oeGB">Negotiation is a collaborative conversation, a means of problem-solving, and an opportunity for transformation, according to negotiation and commercial consultant <a href="https://www.devonsmiley.com/">Devon Smiley</a>. “Something isn’t working for me,” she says. “So how do I make it work for me? How do I transform it?” In the process of this transformation, all involved parties should get what they want; no one side should feel like the loser. </p>
<p id="ZewEaM">How to effectively leverage this balance of give and take requires skill and practice, but mastering the art of negotiation isn’t impossible. Through objective-setting, preparation, and curiosity, even beginner negotiators can equip themselves with the tools to get what they want. </p>
<h3 id="ZlfaAR">Before you can get someone to say yes, practice saying no (and know what will make others say no to you)</h3>
<p id="e95IKr">A natural aspect of negotiation is rejection. Before you can feel comfortable asking for what you want, Chance suggests getting used to saying “no.” “As you become more comfortable practicing saying no, you get more comfortable with the idea of other people saying no to you,” she says, “and that helps you be more comfortable asking.” </p>
<p id="PlViGS">At the start of one of her MBA classes, Chance instructs her students to reject every request or invitation they receive for 24 hours. This exercise allows participants to feel comfortable <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23310442/vox-conversations-boundaries-nedra-glover-tawwab-even-better">setting boundaries</a>. Giving yourself permission to turn down others in low-pressure situations helps prepare you for the inevitability of denying requests in the future.</p>
<p id="swDscY">Notice how others react when you turn them down. For most inconsequential requests, your “no” hasn’t ruined their day or shattered the relationship. The same is true when the roles are reversed. If you’re on the receiving end of a “no,” depending on how important your ask is, you can either try to come to terms both parties are happy with, or you can decide to drop the request, Chance says. </p>
<p id="CfZTv0">There are certain non-negotiables, according to Brian Buck, the chief executive of <a href="https://www.scotworkusa.com/">Scotwork USA</a>, a negotiation consultancy and training firm. Asking someone to change their opinions and principles isn’t likely to go over well. “If I were to go talk to another parent about how to raise their children,” Buck says, “they’re going to have very strong opinions.” There isn’t much you can offer the other party to help them see your way in these situations. Attempts at negotiating prices for certain goods, like the cost of a sweater at a department store or a bunch of bananas at a big-box grocery, probably won’t be successful either, Buck says. </p>
<h3 id="iXqmUE">Don’t take negotiating personally</h3>
<p id="Q7FRlB">Engaging in a back-and-forth over a personal request can feel like a referendum on your worth. <a href="https://www.pon.harvard.edu/tag/cultural-barriers/">Culture</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/09/3-of-the-most-common-challenges-women-face-in-negotiations">gender</a> influence norms and emotions around making requests, but very often people forgo asking for what they want because they don’t want to be seen as greedy or a nuisance, Smiley says. However, a negotiation has very little to do with you. (It should be noted that racial and gender biases impact the outcome of salary negotiation. <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/business/faculty-research/2020/04/29/role-race-salary-negotiations">Studies</a> <a href="https://news.usc.edu/192848/women-men-salary-negotiation-virtual-agents-usc-research/">find</a> these results are because of biased interviewers, not because the interviewer was a poor negotiator.) The other party’s goals, objectives, constraints, and budget factor into their offers. Not getting exactly what you want doesn’t mean the other person doesn’t like you or you’re not worthy. “That’s a terrible way to negotiate,” Chance says, “and it ends up creating a lot of bad vibes that make us not want to negotiate again in the future.” </p>
<p id="YyQKnJ">In most negotiations involving money, you’re often bargaining with a representative of a company or organization. Asking a customer service rep for a discount on your cable bill isn’t an attack on that person’s character; negotiating a higher salary with a human resources manager doesn’t lower their pay. Just because you haggle with a human doesn’t mean the person on the other end will be directly affected. It’s okay to consider your own needs over those of a corporation. </p>
<p id="YW08c2">To do this, Smiley says to consider the “ripple of impact” of how getting what you want can materially impact your life. The consequences of negotiating a raise, for instance, extend beyond the size of your paycheck; the extra money may allow you to enroll your kids in swimming lessons or to make a donation to a charity. “By you asking, there’s more benefit happening than just what’s going in your wallet,” Smiley says. </p>
<p id="L29DjZ">Making a negotiation less personal doesn’t mean removing the human element. Remain polite and professional in tone and pay attention to how the other party responds, Smiley says. Rudeness and aggression are red flags and you should consider how you might be treated down the line. If you’re haggling over the price of tomatoes at the farmer’s market, you may be willing to overlook minor brusqueness, but if you’re weighing signing a two-year lease with a landlord who doesn’t answer questions or who is disrespectful, how will they treat you later? Always be mindful of your reactions and avoid snarky or rude retorts in the heat of the moment. </p>
<h3 id="RFGfmV">Prepare as much as you can prior to negotiating</h3>
<p id="CbjCIZ">Before making a case for what you want, you’ll need to anticipate all the reasons another party might want to counter your proposal. Even for small negotiations, such as asking your friend to change the date of her birthday party so you can attend, there are three things you should be prepared to answer, according to Smiley: your main goals for the interaction, the potential pushback, and a few creative concessions or offers you could make.</p>
<p id="woVHc9">Get creative with your goals, Chance says, because you may succeed by asking for things few people consider requesting. For example, if you’re buying a car, would you prefer higher-end floor mats, an extended warranty, or a lower financing rate in lieu of a discount on the price? “If you haven’t thought of it, you can’t ask for it,” Chance says. “It’s really hard to be creative when you’re stressed. So we should never expect ourselves to come up with great ideas when we’re in a stressful negotiation.”</p>
<p id="Jc9ekX">However, only ask for what you really want and would be satisfied receiving, Voss says. Approaching with too outrageous an offer can come off as disingenuous or manipulative.</p>
<p id="v7TJ7M">In her book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/don-t-leave-money-on-the-table-negotiation-strategies-for-women-leaders-in-male-dominated-industries-jacqueline-twillie-mba/10782798?ean=9781089197928"><em>Don’t Leave Money on the Table: Negotiation Strategies for Women Leaders in Male-Dominated Industries</em></a><em>, </em>negotiation strategist <a href="https://www.jacquelinetwillie.com/">Jacqueline Twillie</a> coined a preparation checklist called LATTE: look at the details, anticipate challenges, think about the walk-away point, talk it through, evaluate options. Twillie likens negotiation to a job interview. Before sitting down with an interviewer, you’ll want to know about the company, its goals, and who you’d be working with. Take a similar approach to negotiating: Who is the other party in the negotiation? What do they want? Then, consider all the ways you could be challenged — your proposed rate is too high, the rental car you want is unavailable, your partner has an important meeting on the day you need them to take your child to a doctor’s appointment — and how you will respond. “This prevents you from walking away from the conversation thinking,<em> </em>‘Oh my goodness, I should have said this or that<em>,</em>’” Twillie says.</p>
<p id="vGw07e">At some point, you may get frustrated and need to take a breather. What are your signs of annoyance? Do you feel rage in the pit of your stomach? Be aware of these tells and remind yourself to take a break if they arise. Voss recommends ending every conversation, even if you’re frustrated, by reiterating how much you want to make a deal with the other person. “The last impression is a lasting impression,” Voss says.</p>
<p id="n7jAod">Once you’ve thoroughly prepared your talking points, practice delivering your ask aloud. For important negotiations, it’s helpful to rehearse the entire scenario with a friend who can help point out your blind spots. Finally, consider other alternatives to your current situation. What other car dealerships, employers, phone companies could you choose?</p>
<p id="BASzqS">However, not every negotiation will be anticipated, so you’ll need to think on your feet for creative solutions. Say the front desk staff at a hotel informs you that, due to an error, the room you booked is no longer available. While you could complain, think about your objective — to find a room to sleep in — and what might make up for the inconvenience, Buck says. Start by asking questions: When will the room be available? What other rooms are open? Are there any amenities that would compensate for the error? You could potentially negotiate a few days of complimentary meals in return for a room with a lower rate than what you originally paid. </p>
<h3 id="RpisvP">Approach the conversation with curiosity, authenticity, and generosity</h3>
<p id="eZQGG0">In order for both sides to come to an agreement, you need to take an interest in what the other party wants. Instead of getting angry, frustrated, or offended when someone counters your proposal, ask open-ended questions, Smiley says. She recommends inquiries like, “What are your thoughts on this?” “How does this align with what you were expecting?” and, “What are your top three priorities?” “A rather cheeky question that I’ve used a few times and I usually get a laugh, but usually a good response too,” Smiley says, “is ‘How can I make this feel better for you without making it worse for me?’” Chance’s magic question is, “What would it take to make this happen?” This invites collaboration and outlines a path forward for requests such as structural changes at work. Sometimes the most straightforward approach is most effective. Buck is a proponent of asking, “How can I get a better deal?” </p>
<p id="ZP1IbB">Address any points of contention, Voss says, like high prices or feelings of frustration. If you’re attempting to set a rate with a new client but fear they will try to negotiate a lower price, try saying, “My price is high,” then, leave a few seconds for the other side to respond or give you the floor to proceed, Voss says. “Because calling out the elephant in the room is what gets rid of the elephant in the room, not denying it, not ignoring it,” he says. Then, let the other side respond.</p>
<p id="JRMYyR">Arming yourself with more information helps you unearth true holdups. For example, if you’re trying to negotiate with your boss a longer deadline on a work project, you might ask about workflow procedures and learn that your portion of the project must be completed before a coworker can begin their contribution. Understanding the bigger picture can help you collaborate on a solution. When the other side feels heard, the negotiation will progress smoothly, Voss says.</p>
<p id="QEMZLD">Once you’ve learned about your counterpart’s goals, think about what you can offer to facilitate an agreement. Smiley suggests using if/then statements, like, “If you can give me a 5 percent discount, then I could pay in cash.”</p>
<h3 id="ed5V7F">Accepting a good-enough offer is a win</h3>
<p id="qFBpdW">Throughout the course of your research and preparation, and before you begin the negotiation, you should set a minimum of what you’re willing to accept. If you’re buying a car, what is the highest price you’re willing to pay for the minimum amount of features and amenities? Should you negotiate a better deal, great; if not, you’re still happy with the agreed-upon price. “Sometimes there’s nothing additional that happens that wasn’t already in the offer, and many times, it was already a really good offer,” Chance says. “Don’t take it personally.”</p>
<p id="TN9hUO">If you’re considering walking away, balance alternative options. Where else can you buy the car? Will their prices be comparable? Do the other cars’ specs match up to the one you’re currently considering? Or are you being a bit unrealistic in what you want? Smiley says this line of questioning can help negotiators decide if they want to continue working toward a deal or walk away.</p>
<h3 id="o8G67V">Don’t be afraid to walk away</h3>
<p id="jNb6KF">Negotiators have to be willing to turn down any potential deal, Twillie says. “When you are not willing to walk away, it doesn’t matter what you’re negotiating, you’ve already given away your power,” she says. Imagine what your life would look like if you didn’t accept this new job, buy this condo, or couldn’t get a discount on this<em> </em>product. There is usually a way forward without accepting a deal that won’t make you happy in the long term. </p>
<p id="Xm8TO4">“That mental path will help you to make a better decision,” Twillie says. </p>

                        <p><span>I just passed my one-year anniversary of being a Senior Research Director for Database at Gartner and it’s been every bit the provocative experience I anticipated. The role has added an enjoyable, new dimension to my professional life, with my peers absolutely making me a better thinker, writer, and communicator. </span></p>
<p><span>One unexpected effect of the position is that I’m now wildly embarrassed by some of the content I delivered to analysts during my many years at past software companies. If I knew then what I know now, I would definitely have done some things differently. </span></p>
<p><span>So, in that spirit, I thought I’d provide quick advice on things to avoid saying to a Gartner (or other) industry analyst during a presentation. If, like I was in the past, you’re in a role where you consistently interact with analysts, hopefully you’ll find this useful.  </span></p>
<h3><span>You’re changing the world</span></h3>
<p><span>For full disclosure, I never said this in the past, but some of my colleagues did. And it’s been said to me multiple times during my first year here. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s great to be part of solutions that do amazing things and genuinely make a difference in your industry, but chances are they aren’t coming close to actually altering the course of human events. And so, unless you have something that’s truly life-altering (e.g., a Webex, Zoom-styled video conferencing solution that doesn’t make you want to gouge your eyes out) don’t elevate the importance of what you’re doing beyond what it actually is. </span></p>
<p><b>What to say instead</b><span>: Drop down from the history-making stratosphere to a real-world context that lets your solution represent the goodness it actually possesses. In my opinion, the best framework to do this is the </span><i><span>before/now</span></i><span> paradigm where </span><i>before</i><span> &lt;insert the horrors life used to be with example(s)&gt; but </span><i>now</i><span> &lt;look at the difference(s) we’ve made&gt;. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s memorable, works nearly every time, and leaves a good impression.       </span></p>
<h3><span>You’re better, faster, cheaper</span></h3>
<p><span>Don’t claim this for two reasons. </span></p>
<p><span>First, in all likelihood, you aren’t. At least if you mean, “compared to everyone else in my competitive space &lt;full stop&gt;”. If you were, you’d have no competition and be napping on a beach somewhere right now. </span></p>
<p><span>Next, all three claims are incredibly transient, especially the last two. “Better” is in the eye of the beholder and faster/cheaper changes almost daily depending on new software and other infrastructure releases. </span></p>
<p><span>Trust me, this is a banner you don’t want to wave. </span></p>
<p><b>What to say instead</b><span>: as with the prior no-no, the best thing to do is drop down from the lofty Hulk-smash-everyone position to a more defensible stance of presenting the use cases, environments, and technical scenarios </span><i><span>where you do, indeed, stand out</span></i><span>. Include a couple of meaningful examples and you’re set. </span></p>
<h3><span>Irrelevant facts about your business    </span></h3>
<p><span>One DBMS vendor has repeatedly told me with pride how much larger their sales funnel has grown over the past 6+ quarters. However, their total customer count has remained flat for the past 2 years, which makes that metric mostly irrelevant from a bottom line perspective. </span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to communicating your momentum, remember there are stats that matter and those that don’t actually represent practical progress where your business is concerned. </span></p>
<p><span>A similar issue is exaggerating the contribution your software makes in a customer’s business. It’s tempting to say “We power &lt;insert massive app from prominent customer&gt;” but don’t say that unless you really are </span><i><span>the</span></i><span> engine driving the app vs. simply being used in a lesser component of the system. Just because customer X has bought something from you, that doesn’t mean you now own the account. </span></p>
<p><b>What to say instead</b><span>: Cite increasing revenue, your cloud product’s adoption gains, customer wins, retention metrics, competitive switch-out’s, new market doors you’ve opened and other data that shows you’re gaining market share and making a difference in your chosen market. Also, it’s fine to brag about “powering” just a portion of an app if it shows the distinctiveness with which you handle such app components.       </span></p>
<h3><span>Tell it like it is</span></h3>
<p><span>Let me wrap up by telling you a quick story about a situation I was in that ties all this together. </span></p>
<p><span>Years ago, a sales rep at one of my DBMS companies asked me to do a presentation for the top tech leadership at the headquarters of the world’s biggest cable news network. The chief CIO and CTO were there along with all their lieutenants, arms folded. Massive room. The projector for the presentation descended from the ceiling and was the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. </span></p>
<p><span>Intimidating. </span></p>
<p><span>My intuition told me this crowd had seen and heard it all from every vendor that came before me so I decided to throw them a curveball. After a (very!) short company intro I said, “Because I’ve been a database guy for a long time like all of you, I know the last thing you want to hear is how we think we save the world. So instead, because you don’t want to waste time and money using us for something that will fail, let me start by telling you what we’re </span><i><span>not </span></i><span>good at.”</span></p>
<p><span>Suddenly all their arms came down. They started listening. </span></p>
<p><span>I concluded my here’s-where-we-stink content, and then said, “Now, let me finish by telling you where and how we can actually help you.” I wrapped up and sat down. </span></p>
<p><span>The room was silent for 5 seconds and then the head CIO actually slapped the conference table and said, “THAT…was the most refreshing presentation I’ve heard in a long time!” Turning to his troops he said, “Now, let’s figure out how we can start using these guys.” </span></p>
<p><span>The moral of the story is people appreciate humility, truth, and guidance that’s of a no-baloney nature. Do that for not only Gartner analysts but also for everyone else you communicate with, and I guarantee people will take notice.</span></p>
