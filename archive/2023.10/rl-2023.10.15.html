(It may not be a stable identity over time, but it is <i>at least for the present.</i>)</p><p>Where a list is returned, <i>the size of the list determines how usable it is, and how it is usable.</i>  Ten items can be quickly scanned to find the relevant item(s), if they exist.  100 or 1,000 items can often still be managed manually, though they&#39;ll typically take some time.  Somewhere between 100 and a few thousand items, though, you&#39;re in the range where automated assessments or filtering becomes necessary.</p><p>Large libraries themselves typically have tens of thousands to millions of items.  The largest book collections (Library of Congress, British Library) have roughly 150 million books (or equivalents).  Other records may exist in greater numbers:  periodicals, financial records, databases.  Facebook has reported ~5 billion items posted <i>daily</i> for some years now.  (I suspect most of those are trivial, but that still leaves a large number of potentially non-trivial items.)  Surveillance and other large-scale data collection systems may be larger still.

I was specifically comparing it to Git Annex which is hard to categorize in these terms. It forces every file to become a symbolic link to the actual file living in `.git/annex/` and then every query temporarily mutating the hierarchy of directories storing these symbolic links. I found the latter disruptive enough (in particular for the directory mtimes) that I was actively avoiding doing any such queries. See: <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/metadata_driven_views/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/metadata_driven_views/</a></p><p>On the other hand my current setup involves TMSU queries which result in virtual Emacs directory editor (dired) views that don&#39;t affect anything else. I don&#39;t even use the FUSE functionality of TMSU.

Editing PDFs is already a pain, applying metadata to some entry in a database or wiki, or third-party website, isn&#39;t possible at all.</p><p>The remaining options seem to me analogues of practices with books.</p><p>It&#39;s possible to &#34;rebind&#34; an item and include biblographic information into the equivalent of fly-leaves of that work, much as a library may rebind a book and apply a label with inventory number(s), call number(s), and/or bibliographic data to that book.  Since physical objects <i>are</i> inherently modifiable and enclosable, this makes sense.  The digital analogues vary, but are at least theoretically available (e.g., enclosing a work in an archive format which includes metadata.  See the WARC (Web ARChive) file format for example:  &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WARC_(file_format)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WARC_(file_format)</a>&gt;.  Epub files and software packaging formats such as RPM and APT are other examples of standardised file structures which encapsulate others.</p><p>The other practice of a library is to abstract out the metadata to a <i>catalogue</i>, effectively <i>a metadata index</i>.</p><p>In a physical library archive, this involves a <i>cataloguing process</i>, as part of item acquisition workflows.  The metadata for many traditionally-published works is already centralised such that it can be obtained from specific organisations such as the US Library of Congress, the British Library, the OCLC (originally the Ohio College Library Center, which has both its own item identifier and manages the Dewey Decimal Classification), the International ISBN Agency or one of its national affiliates (e.g., Bowker, in the US), the International DOI Foundation (for DOI assignments:  digital object identifiers, used extensively in academic journals).  <i>Circulation</i> of items is managed through a <i>circulation desk</i>, for both external lending <i>and</i> managing, tracking, and reshelving books used <i>within</i> the library itself, but not being borrowed externally.</p><p>For digital media, the equivalents would be either some sort of management system, which would require an application-specific interface, <i>or</i> a filesystem which incorporates not only metadata <i>but workflow management</i>.  I&#39;m leaning toward the latter concept as more universal, though that also raises the question of how to deal with workflows in which contents leave or enter that filesystem context itself.</p><p>But <i>with</i> a filesystem, you have a number of additional possibilities available:</p><p>- The pairing of works with metadata is automated.</p><p>- Workflows can be integrated into filesystem actions.  The act of <i>creating a file</i> would also <i>create the file metadata</i> (to a greater extent than present inode entries do).</p><p>- Additionally, introducing the notion of <i>process status</i> means that the filesystem itself could distinguish between works which have no or only default cataloguing data applied, those which have had additional metadata added (say, from an external look-up or automated heuristics based on file contents).</p><p>- Renames and deletions are now managed through the filesystem itself rather than third-party tools.</p><p>- I&#39;d like to see both versioning (changes to a given file) <i>and</i> relationships (source, derived, referenced, and referencing works) tracked as well.</p><p>- Different <i>forms</i> of a work could be tracked together.  The markup-language source and generated outputs (PDF, PS, ePub, HTML, plain text, etc.) versions of a text.  Translations.  Audio formats.  <i>Different performances</i> of a work.  Optical scans of printed material.  Photographs of visual or plastic arts (sculpture), or architecture.  See FRBR (Functional Requirements for Biblographic Records), and the Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item distinctions:  &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bi...</a>&gt;).</p><p>- Ideally, some sort of highly-invariant fingerprinting such that different versions of a work can be identified and matched despite different formats or slight modifications (intentional differences between editions, translations, errors or damage introduced over time).  Traditional <i>whole work</i> hashes fail to offer this, though segmented and normalised hashes or vectors might be able to do so.</p><p>Again, the largest problem with a <i>filesystem</i> approach is in imports and exports from that filesystem-based archive.  That would probably best be achieved through wrapper formats and applications or servers for other organisations or the general public.

For example tag A may require tag B to exist but not C, etc.<p>In the end maintaining order always requires effort, if you have a hierarchical folder structure and you decide to add another category you have the same problem.
And realistically folders are &#34;good enough&#34; for most situations, you can choose for each file how fine-grained the categorization should be and the mental overhead for finding a file is often not that bad.

Interestingly, hierarchical systems used by libraries tend to ignore genre. The Dewey Decimal system doesn&#39;t classify literature by genre but instead by language, though some overarching genres (drama vs poetry) are treated as subcategories of language (e.g., German poetry is 831, French poetry is 841), but only for major European languages.

The justification on the website, that it prevents new directories from disrupting the user&#39;s mental map, is unconvincing. There are many methods for that that don&#39;t require a team to align on a numbering system and fixed directory order - shortcuts, bookmarks, snippet managers, broot, and z, to name a few. Not all methods are available in all contexts, but at least some are.</p><p>Prepending numbers, on the other hand, forces users to, at best, waste time learning a system they might not need to use again or, at worst, bikeshed about what number to give a new directory or how to renumber if a change is needed. Users can&#39;t even skim directory names because the order is fixed and they&#39;ve been robbed of the ability to sort alphabetically. The larger the team, the worse all this becomes.

I <i>still</i> remember back in 2007 at the National Australia Bank, the WinXP deployment project stored its DNS designs in folder `53`.</p><p>My theory is that people do this because the <i>alphabet</i> is unreliable. What was the name of that DNS designs folder? I don&#39;t remember. But it could have been any one of a bunch of things: DNS, Designs (DNS), Dynamic Name System, so on. That choice is essentially arbitrary because we have this language full of synonyms. And so how do you remember it and the dozens of other folders that you use regularly? You don&#39;t!</p><p>Numbers lock things in place. `53` will always be there. The person who created that doesn&#39;t give a hoot about `52` or `54`. They just know that their stuff is at `53`.</p><p>Adding a whole bunch of new folders that start with &#39;B&#39; would have messed up the spatial placement of our `53` folder, but now that&#39;s not an issue. `53` is always exactly where it was, and muscle memory can develop.</p><p>I dunno. I haven&#39;t done the studies. I&#39;d love to! But this is a pattern that I see over and over. To dismiss it as &#39;wrong&#39; ignores the fact that people are doing this for a reason.

But making a proper organization takes time and <i>observation</i>, and only long-time users with an urgent need have that knowledge.

From their own examples, a folder called `22 Contracts` is going to be sorted into a different position in a list than it would if it were just named `Contracts` - without the number, I both know exactly what the name of the folder I want is, and where it will appear in a directory listing. With someone else&#39;s choice of number at the front, I know neither of these things.</p><p>Basically, every single thing this claims to solve is either not a problem in the first place, is trivially solved without making people learn a stranger&#39;s personal numbering preferences, or is made considerably worse by this system.

That&#39;s strongly informed by a long deep dive into other classification and bibliographic schemes.</p><p>One key distinction is between a <i>location-based classification system</i> and an <i>indexing or tagging system</i>.</p><p>A large bibliographic institution with an extensive history which maintains its own versions of <i>both</i> concepts is the US Library of Congress.</p><p>The Library of Congress <i>Classification</i> is based on a scheme originally inherited from Thomas Jefferson for organising his own personal library whose donation to the US Congress inaugurated the Library of Congress.  It is based on 21 top-level divisions, based on letters of the Roman alphabet from A-Z, excluding the letters I, O, W, &amp; X).  These are further broken into a vast number of further divisions, with the ultimate aim of <i>identifying an individual work</i> AND <i>locating that work within the library&#39;s physical archive</i>.  Books, as physical objects, occupy a distinct space, and one space only, which cannot be shared with another book.</p><p>The Library of Congress (LoC) <i>Subject Headings</i> are a set of <i>descriptions</i> of works.  Unlike the <i>classification</i>, a book may be assigned <i>multiple</i> subject headings, corresponding to its major themes.  These headings are not used to <i>define a book&#39;s location</i> but rather <i>aid in its discovery</i> when searching by subject.</p><p>Both of these classifications have evolved over well over a century, are the subject of ongoing efforts and development, and have had to address the fact of change in both the underlying subject matter (e.g., the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Soviet Union, and Colonial Africa are no longer extant) and how subject matters are addressed and referenced (psychology, sexuality, race, economics, scientific discoveries, and technological advances have all made old terms obsolete or deprecated, and introduced new ones).</p><p>These are not the only classification and cataloguing schemes used by the US government, let alone other bibliography-manangement institutions elsewhere.  The Superintendent of Documentation (SUDOC) system is used by the Government Printing Office to manage <i>its</i> publications and archives, and is organised principally around <i>government offices</i> (Cabinet divisions amongst the Executive, others in the Legislative and Judiciary), as well as date.</p><p>Some libraries don&#39;t organise works by subject but instead assign a location code to works <i>independent of subject</i> by which the works may be requested by patrons.  (These are typically &#34;closed-stack&#34; systems.)</p><p>There are other classifications:  Dewey Decimal (superficially resembling the LoC classification), Decimal Classification, and Colon Classification are amongst the most widely used.</p><p><i>Digital storage has different requirements than physical.</i>  Documents needn&#39;t have a single storage location or address.  They may be part of numerous distinct systems, often with idiosyncratic or incompatible management or organisation themselves.  Documents are far more likely to be <i>live</i>, with ongoing development and adaptation as opposed to the static state of a print archive.  &#34;Documents&#34; may in fact be data held in databases, wikis, or other systems, and be associated with multiple projects.</p><p>One generally useful set of concepts for organising documents is the <i>Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</i> (DCMES) with a set of 15 defined elements:  Contributor, Coverage, Creator, Date, Description, Format, Identifier, Language, Publisher, Relation, Rights, Source, Subject, Title, and Type.  A document might have zero or more of each element associated with it (e.g., multiple authors, translators, illustrators, and/or editors as Contributors).  And it&#39;s been observed that some elements are themselves ambiguous (e.g., what is the difference between a &#34;contributor&#34; and a &#34;creator&#34;).  But <i>in general</i> this at least provides a useful framework for considering works.</p><p>&lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core</a>&gt;</p><p>In looking at document management I&#39;ve found a few other elements are useful to consider:</p><p>- Project:  the task being worked on.</p><p>- Workflows:  <i>what is being done</i> with documents.</p><p>- Document lifecycle:  Often consisting of a set of stages:  creation, edits/updates, acquisition, cataloguing, format conversions or transformations, transmission or publishing, and deacquisition or destruction.</p><p>- Security and/or distribution scope.  Keep in mind that <i>metadata itself</i> has significant value and should be considered withing your data management / privacy / security policies.</p><p>- Teams and participants.  Both within and external to your organisation.</p><p>- Organisational evolution.  Personnel, departments, divisions, enterprises, and governments come, go, and change.  The terms used now might not apply in a year, or 10, or 100.  (Your document lifescycle might not extend to 10 or 100  years. Then again, it might.)</p><p>Most usually, I&#39;ll find I use the following in organisation:</p><p>- Date.  Generally the start date of a project.  Organising documents by time makes a great deal of sense, and creates natural search spans:  day, week, month, quarter, year, decade, etc.</p><p>- Author/owner.  The person, department, or institution which created or &#34;owns&#34; the document.  Within a sufficiently large organisation, these should live within a departmental / divisional structure.</p><p>- Title.  How the document is generally referred to.  This can be startlingly ambiguous, especially internally.  Third-party documents tend to have far more fixed and established titles, though even these can be tricky.  E.g., &#34;The White Album&#34; is not actually titled &#34;The White Album&#34;.</p><p>- Other relevant distinguishing information.</p><p>Where possible, I&#39;ll try to store information under a single filesystem directory hierarchy, though in practice things tend to live in multiple places:  a shared code repository (public or private), a wiki or other platform, databases and application data.  If possible these are tied together in some useful fashion, though any such organisation tends to be approximate and lagging reality at best.</p><p>With a sufficiently large organisation, a librarian role who manages overall storage and resolves disputes is helpful.  Though you&#39;ll be exceedingly lucky to have someone actually assigned to such a role.</p><p>Johnny Decimal is interesting, and may well work for some cases.  I doubt it meets all needs, and certainly isn&#39;t the One True Path for all individuals and organisations.

But “</span><a href="https://www.domino.com/content/minimalist-home-mixing-prints-guide/"><span>minimalist</span></a><span>”? </span></p><p><span>Of all the design aesthetics one might choose to adhere to, professing yourself as a minimalist has become dangerous territory. To longtime maximalists and commitment-phobes alike, a declaration as bold as this is the decorative equivalent of joining a cult.</span></p><p><span>Like any other style, minimalism is a scale. On one end of the spectrum, you have your <a href="https://www.domino.com/content/marie-kondo-cuyana-travel-bag-packing-tips/">Marie Kondos</a> of the world—sticking solely to the essentials that spark joy—and, on the other end, you have low-key neat freaks who like collecting but hate clutter. No matter where you land on that line, being more conscious and considerate about the items that we own is an admirable pursuit. Not to mention that embracing a more organized way of life makes for a hell of a New Year’s resolution. </span></p><p><span>To learn how to keep a happier and cleaner home in 2019, we turned to self-professed minimalists and superbly tidy homeowners for their advice. </span></p><div data-reactroot=""><p><img alt="GosiaPiatek_photo_by_YoanJolly_01.jpg" src="https://pocket-syndicated-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ec408a32f831.jpg"/></p><p><span><span> </span> <span>Photo by Yoan Jolly.</span></span></p></div><h2 data-reactroot="">Commit to Timeless Materials<br/></h2><p><span>Part of the trick to perfecting minimalism is getting it right the first time. While most of us already tend to think of our furniture as a monetary investment, it’s also important to view big-ticket items as an aesthetic investment. </span></p><p><span>“I’ve found that natural furnishings and materials are timeless,” says Gosia Piatek, New Zealand–based fashion designer and founder of sustainable clothing brand </span><a href="https://us.kowtowclothing.com/"><span>Kowtow</span></a><span>. In her </span><a href="https://www.domino.com/content/gosia-piatek-bright-minimalist-home-tour/"><span>700-square-foot family home</span></a><span>, for instance, you’ll find a sofa made from local wool and a pine-and-steel dining table. “You’ll rarely have to update those pieces because they wear beautifully over time.” </span></p><div data-reactroot=""><p><img alt="AmyHarrity_photo_by_AmyHarrity_01.jpg" src="https://pocket-syndicated-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ec40988ebc07.jpg"/></p><p><span><span> </span> <span>Photo by Amy Harrity.</span></span></p></div><h2 data-reactroot="">Before You Buy More, Ask: “Does This Inspire Me?”<br/></h2><p><span>If a once-a-year walk-through isn’t enough, catch yourself regularly while you’re shopping. “I think it is important to check in with your space often and make sure that there are not things that have accumulated that are not functional or bring you supreme inspiration,” says self-professed minimalist and clothing designer Jesse Kamm. </span></p><p><span>Kamm’s </span><a href="https://www.domino.com/content/jesse-kamm-los-angeles-office/"><span>streamlined L.A. office</span></a><span> only makes room for accessories and objects that fuel her creative energy. “In the modern era, we’re sold the idea of constant consumption. I think this phenomenon can lead to the overwhelming, suffocating feeling that buying and storing a lot of things can make us feel good.”</span></p><p><span>Lesson learned? Before you walk to the checkout line, ask yourself, <em>Is this cheap Ikea coffee table really worth it? When I look at it, does it feel like me?</em> If it’s not something you’d brag about to friends at a dinner party, wait for the real deal. </span></p><div data-reactroot=""><p><img alt="AmyHarrity_photo_by_AmyHarrity_02.jpg" src="https://pocket-syndicated-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ec409a00ca89.jpg"/></p><p><span><span> </span> <span>Photo by Amy Harrity.</span></span></p></div><h2 data-reactroot="">Shop Vintage<br/></h2><p><span>Not everything in your home has to be clean, crisp, and new. Incorporating aged pieces sourced from local vintage and antique shops is a great way to tell a story within your space. Without veering from her pared-down aesthetic, photographer Amy Harrity’s </span><a href="https://www.domino.com/content/amy-harrity-minimalist-san-francisco-home-tour/"><span>zen San Francisco home</span></a><span> is the perfect blend of flea market finds and modern pieces. Her word of advice? “Wait to find the pieces you love!” shares Harrity. </span></p><p><span>Fewer items with character will always beat out a ton of clutter that bores. “If there’s something I need, I look for it secondhand or I make it if it’s possible. For instance, if I need a new light in a corner of a room, I might look on Craigslist for three months before I find the right thing,” says Kamm. “This process is slow, but when I finally find the thing </span><span>I am looking for, it often feels much more meaningful.” </span></p><div data-reactroot=""><p><img alt="JesseKamm_photo_by_LaureJoliet_02.jpg" src="https://pocket-syndicated-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ec409b8d6d51.jpg"/></p><p><span><span> </span> <span>Photo by Laure Joliet.</span></span></p></div><h2 data-reactroot="">Schedule an Annual Purge<br/></h2><p><span>On January 1, whip out your agenda and mark down a day (or an entire weekend) to dedicate to clutter. We’re not talking spring-cleaning or tossing a few throwaway items in a donation bin: We’re talking a thorough purge. “It’ll help you stay organized and [ensure] everything in your home has a home,” adds Harrity. </span></p><div data-reactroot=""><p><img alt="GosiaPiatek_photo_by_YoanJolly_02.jpg" src="https://pocket-syndicated-images.s3.amazonaws.com/5ec409d2d4a49.jpg"/></p><p><span><span> </span> <span>Photo by Yoan Jolly.</span></span></p></div><h2 data-reactroot="">Do a Nightly Sweep Through<br/></h2><p><span>“It is easy to keep a neat space when there is very little to clutter it up,” suggests Kamm. Her hot tip? “Spend about 10 minutes each day putting things back in their place. When you do a bit each day, you’re more likely to stay on top of the organization. Plus, the OCD helps.”</span></p><p><span>It’s easy to forget what you own when you don’t see or touch it on a daily basis. Going around to each room—even if you’re just looking—will help you out when it’s time for your annual purge and you’re trying to prioritize what needs to go and what can stay. </span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i>Lydia Geisel is a Digital Editorial Assistant at Domino.</i></p></section></article></div></div>

Securing a job near home rather than an adventurous position overseas.</p><p>Our most enduring regrets are the ones that stem from our failure to live up to our ideal selves, according to new Cornell research.</p><p>Psychologist <a href="https://psychology.cornell.edu/thomas-d-gilovich">Tom Gilovich</a> and a former Cornell graduate student have found people are haunted more by regrets about failing to fulfill their hopes, goals and aspirations than by regrets about failing to fulfill their duties, obligations and responsibilities.</p><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0000326">The research, “The Ideal Road Not Taken,”</a> was published in the April issue of the journal Emotion. Gilovich’s co-author was Shai Davidai, Ph.D. ’15, now at The New School for Social Research.</p><p>“When we evaluate our lives, we think about whether we’re heading toward our ideal selves, becoming the person we’d like to be. Those are the regrets that are going to stick with you, because they are what you look at through the windshield of life,” said Gilovich, professor of psychology. “The ‘ought’ regrets are potholes on the road. Those were problems, but now they’re behind you.</p><p>“To be sure, there are certain failures to live up to our ‘ought’ selves that are extremely painful and can haunt a person forever; so many great works of fiction draw upon precisely that fact. But for most people those types of regrets are far outnumbered by the ways in which they fall short of their ideal selves.”</p><p>The research builds on the idea that three elements make up a person’s sense of self: the actual, ideal and the ought selves. The actual self is made up of the attributes a person believes they possess. The ideal self is the attributes they would ideally like to possess, such as hopes, goals, aspirations or wishes. The ought self is the person they feel they should have been based on duties, obligations and responsibilities. “Your ought self could be, ‘I ought to be a person who is healthier and should go to the gym more,’” Gilovich said.</p><p>The paper also builds on Gilovich’s seminal 1990s research that found people tend to regret the things they hadn’t done rather than the things they had.</p><p>“In the short term, people regret their actions more than inactions,” he said. “But in the long term, the inaction regrets stick around longer.”</p><p>Building on those ideas, Gilovich and Davidai hypothesized that people’s most enduring regrets in life come from discrepancies between their actual and ideal selves.</p><p>“The failure to be your ideal self is usually an inaction,” said Gilovich. “It’s ‘I frittered away my time and never got around to teaching myself to code or play a musical instrument.’”</p><p>Gilovich and Davidai surveyed hundreds of participants through the course of six studies, describing the differences between the ought and ideal selves, and asking them to list and categorize their regrets based on these descriptions.</p><p>The participants said they experienced regrets about their ideal self far more often (72 percent versus 28 percent). More than half mentioned more ideal-self regrets than ought-self regrets when asked to list their regrets in life so far. And when asked to name their single biggest regret in life, 76 percent of participants mentioned a regret about not fulfilling their ideal self.</p><p>Why do ideal-self failures spark such enduring regret? “People are more likely to take active steps to rectify regrets related to their ought selves, so those regrets are more likely to be filed away as resolved and thereby seem less bothersome with time,” Gilovich said.</p><p>In addition, the expectations of the ought self are usually more concrete and involve specific rules – such as how to behave at a funeral – and so are easier to fulfill. But ideal-related regrets tend to be more general: Be a good parent, be a good mentor. “Well, what does that mean, really?” Gilovich said. “There aren’t clear guideposts. And you can always do more.”</p><p>The research has practical implications, he said. First, we often assume we first need inspiration before we can strive to achieve our ideals. But a significant amount of psychological research shows that’s not true, Gilovich said.</p><p>“As the Nike slogan says: ‘Just do it,’” he said. “Don’t wait around for inspiration, just plunge in. Waiting around for inspiration is an excuse. Inspiration arises from engaging in the activity.”</p><p>And people often fail to achieve their ideal goals because they’re worried about how it will look to others. For example, a person might want to learn how to sing but feel they could never let others hear how bad they are.</p><p>Again, Gilovich says, just do it.</p><p>“People are more charitable than we think and also don’t notice us nearly as much as we think,” he said. “If that’s what holding you back – the fear of what other people will think and notice – then think a little more about just doing it.”</p><p><em>This story also appeared in the</em> <a href="http://bit.ly/2kpcxxy">Cornell Chronicle</a>.</p>
