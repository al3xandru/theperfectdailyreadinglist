The human mind tends to find causal narrative in everything, and we tend to think of the way things are as the way they ought to be. But actual history isn’t like that at all. History is not preordained. Where we are today was never inevitable. We are constantly confronted with a selection of choices about our actions. Only by reconstructing the full spectrum of choices — and the perceived cost of each one — that people faced at the time, can we get a full understanding of the meaning of history and the magnitude of the actions those historical actors took. Counterfactual history turned out to be a frequent theme in my reading this year.</em></p><p id="d92e">Here are all of the titles I read this year in rough chronological order.</p><h2 id="c1a6">1. Homeland, by Cory Doctorow (2013)</h2><p id="67f6">This sequel to <em>Little Brother</em> continues the story of young kids fighting against an oppressive law-and-order regime in San Francisco. If you are a white, middle class straight man, it reads as wild science fiction. If you are anyone else, it’s only a slightly exaggerated quotidian story.</p><h2 id="9909">2. The Sugar Barons: Family, Corruption, Empire, and War in the West Indies, by Matthew Parker (2011)</h2><p id="d7dd">In the 1800s, the amount of money generated for the Caribbean sugar barons was greater than the amount of money generated by all of the 13 American colonies combined. The sugar business was highly profitable for two reasons: it destroyed the land, and it destroyed millions of black lives. The foundation of the American slave trade was sugar long before it was cotton or tobacco. As the massive edifice of the United States’ self-aggrandizing history is slowly chipped away by black, brown, red, yellow and other clear-eyed voices, a more authentic image of how our great nation was built. The sugar trade in the Caribbean is far less well-known than the other slave economies in the new world, and this book sheds useful light on our history.</p><h2 id="2354">3. Three Ordinary Girls: The Remarkable Story of Three Dutch Teenagers Who Became Spies, Saboteurs, Nazi Assassins — and WWII Heroes, by Tim Brady (2021)</h2><p id="df1d">In the Twentieth Century, Nazi occupation of European countries confronted millions of ordinary citizens with monumental choices, mostly disguised as simple, daily acts. This triple biography tells how three very young people made the extremely difficult choice to actively fight against their fascist oppressors. A book like this makes you wonder what choices <em>you</em> would make in the same situation. Would you coast along? collaborate? suicide? Or fight against terrible odds for something that isn’t clearly in your best interest? The stories of these three brave young women is a powerful example of counterfactual history.</p><h2 id="308c">4. Consider Phlebas, by Iain M. Banks (1987)</h2><p id="c847">This is the first of Banks “culture” novels. It was a good read, but rougher than his later culture book, <em>Use of Weapons</em> (that I read a few years ago). I kinda wish I had read this one 30 years ago.</p><h2 id="5230">5. The Origins of Totalitarianism, by Hannah Arendt (1951)</h2><p id="de40">This dauntingly long and intellectually challenging book kept me from reading it for many years, but the breadth and number of other authors who reference this book made tackling it inevitable. It was certainly a slog, but ultimately a slog worth slogging. The book consists of three lengthy essays: <em>Anti-Semitism, Imperialism, </em>and<em> Totalitarianism</em>. All are enlightening and worth reading but it was the third and final essay that really opened my eyes. I’ve always imagined that authoritarianism, dictatorship, and totalitarianism were synonymous. This book disabused me of that notion. The essence of authoritarianism is a rigid hierarchy of authority, originating and descending from one all-powerful person. The essence of totalitarianism is violence and coercion and constant contradiction. It’s fear and distrust and a general lack of any rigidity whatsoever. The chaos, uncertainty, and fear is what drives people to abandon self-rule and give over to a totalitarian leader. Hitler and Stalin were totalitarians, as is Donald Trump.</p><h2 id="a52c">6. Maiden Voyages: Women and the Golden Age of Transatlantic Travel, by Siân Evans (2020)</h2><p id="86f3">This was a fun read about a long-forgotten era. In the first half of the Twentieth Century, transcontinental travel was accomplished by steamship. These giant ships carried penniless immigrants and wealthy oligarchs. There were lots of wives and mothers in the former category, and lots of actresses, mistresses, and debutantes in the latter. While this book describes all of them, it devotes the lion’s share of its attention to the women who worked on the massive ocean liners. The very nature of the work — caring for people — made it ideally suited for the contemporaneous roles of women in western society. Yet, at that time, women were largely considered only useful if they were subsumed in a subordinate role in a patriarchal relationship. The newly available jobs on ocean liners took young (and older) women away from those cloying, protective relationships and sent them to distant shores and far flung outposts. And the job put these women at sea alone, insulated from their constrained upbringing. Generally, the women loved their work and accomplished remarkable things while afloat. In particular, the great Atlantic fleet of ocean liners continued sailing across the pond through two world wars, and more than a few women were lost at sea due to enemy action.</p><h2 id="8165">7. The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz, by Erik Larson (2020)</h2><p id="7f67">A friend loaned me this book and I really appreciated it. I’ve enjoyed other books by Larson before, but I had never heard of this one. I’m very pleased to have read it. We all know the story of England’s defiance of Hitler’s Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain in 1940–41 and of Churchill’s heroic leadership during this time (In an address to the House of Commons in the midst of battle, the Prime Minister famously said, “Never was so much owed by so many to so few”). In hindsight, it looks pre-ordained that the plucky brits would vanquish the cartoonishly stiff Nazis in the dogfights over London and Coventry, but counterfactual history leads us to a different conclusion. The fight was anything but certain. The consensus at the time was that the Nazis would invade at any moment. Pretty much everyone in the world thought that Great Britain would collapse with the same alacrity as had France, Belgium, and Poland, including the English themselves. Their citizens formed into Home Guard units to “fight on the beaches, in the fields, in the streets.” This book is an intimate diary of the life of the British leader during these bleak months.</p><h2 id="4a6d">8. The Peripheral, by William Gibson (2014)</h2><p id="839e">I have enormous respect for the author of this book. I heard him speak at a conference years ago and he blew my mind with the way he highlighted connections in the world that had been invisible to me. I looked forward to reading this book, but ultimately it made no sense to me and I failed to even finish it. I felt like if only I had tried harder to understand which character was speaking and what truths they were illuminating, I’d <em>get it</em>. But neither the story nor the “truths” seemed <em>worth it</em> to me. I am sorry about this, and feel like I failed Gibson more than he failed me, but then I remembered that it is the author’s responsibility to make the reader want to turn the page. So, there you have it: a personal disappointment but your mileage may vary.</p><h2 id="fb3f">9. Whole Earth: The Many Lives of Stewart Brand, by John Markoff (2022)</h2><p id="0ee3">John Markoff has been writing about Silicon Valley for as long as it has existed. He writes clearly and truthfully about complex technologies and the people that populate their worlds. In this excellent book Markoff gives us the full biography of one of the most important figures in the development of our current digitally-informed world. Stewart Brand isn’t a scientist, nor a capitalist, nor an engineer. Rather, he’s formed from the same mold as Buckminster Fuller: a futurist, a person who sees the shape of what is to come looming out of the darkness years before others can even detect its presence. Brand’s particular specialty is tools, and his seminal publication, <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>, was subtitled “Access to Tools”. As Markoff has chronicled elsewhere, the progenitors of Silicon Valley were hippies and counterculturalists, and Brand was an archetype of the intelligent, energetic, questing, norm-breaking, and self-medicating 1960s counter culture. In that guise he helped to bring together the disparate elements that created the microcomputer revolution, the ecology revolution, and the social media revolution. In hindsight, Brand’s eclectic choices make sense, but viewed counterfactually, we can see just how remarkable they were. Brand struggled with many of the issues familiar to men of that era, and with studied sensitivity Markoff shows how Brand addressed, ignored, or justified his patrician, white, male upbringing. As a biography, it firmly but gently describes a fully formed human, warts and all, a human who illuminated the future world we inhabit today.</p><h2 id="345d">10. The Robots of Dawn, by Isaac Asimov (1983)</h2><p id="f97a">As I boy I devoured Isaac Asimov’s <em>Foundation Trilogy</em> and his robot stories. As an adult, I fondly but firmly set those books aside. Several months ago I found this book in a jumble sale and bought it for a dollar expecting to rekindle my love of the puzzles posed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Three Laws of Robotics</a>. Sadly, that didn’t happen. The characters in this book seemed unrealistic and as flat as cardboard. The situations seemed too artificial and contrived. The storyline was unappealing. I can’t say whether the problems were there all along and I just matured as a reader, or whether Asimov’s robots — created in the 1940s — simply haven’t aged well enough to work in the 21st Century.</p><h2 id="8c8f">11. Dear Miss Kopp, by Amy Stewart (2021)</h2><p id="3602">Another chapter in the long, fictional-but-fact-based tale of the amazing Kopp sisters in the early years of the Twentieth Century. This volume is written in the epistolary manner which befits the story’s era. The sisters are separated by World War One, but all are doing their part for the war effort. Norma is in France training homing pigeons, Constance is catching German spies in Washington, and Fleurette is entertaining the troops at home. As are all of the novels in this series, it’s light and fun to read with a solid core of relevant history.</p><h2 id="8c34">12. Confessions of a Recovering Engineer: Transportation for a Strong Town, by Charles L. Marohn Jr. (2021)</h2><p id="45cd">This book is a followup to the author’s previous book, <em>Strong Towns </em>(which I have not yet read). It’s a more personal look at his professional journey from urban traffic engineer doing conventional street design to an enlightened advocate for designing streets and roads that create more socially and economically viable living spaces. Like most good lessons, he learned this one the hard way: by first doing it wrong and being forced to justify those errors to its victims. His main takeaway is the understanding that <em>roads</em> are mechanisms that allow autos to go from town to town, while <em>streets</em> are mechanisms that allow autos to go from building to building within one town. He shows how conventional transportation design conflates the two very separate purposes into a single, omnipresent entity that he calls “stroads.” The author shows how stroads are inefficient and ineffective — and often deadly — in either the road or the street role. He details the institutional mechanisms that continue to create stroads all across the country, wasting lives, opportunity, and treasure. He proposes effective and achievable solutions. He then describes how the professional society of transportation engineers has engaged in a campaign of character and career assassination against him for his forthright and public stand.</p><h2 id="8808">13. The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine, by Serhii Plokhy (2015)</h2><p id="0909">When Putin invaded Ukraine in February of this year I realized how ignorant I was of the situation. I tweeted a request for a recommendation of an introductory history book about the country, and this one received multiple shout-outs. The book is dry and tough and thorough. I forced my way through it and am glad I did, but I don’t recommend it as an introductory history (There’s a briefer, better, more useful capsule history of Ukraine in Anne Applebaum’s <em>Red Famine</em>). Plokhy’s book is very purposefully named <em>The Gates of Europe</em> to drive home a fundamental point: Ukraine is a European nation, not an Asian one. Russia has never really been a European country and — while it would like to own Europe — it doesn’t want to be a part of it. Ukraine, on the other hand, has always been a part of Europe but for both survival and for socioeconomic reasons, has allied itself with various neighbors and empires over the centuries. Its marriage to the Soviet Union was never a happy one, and Ukraine was forced into the role of a Soviet colony more than that of a member state. This history starts as far back as history is recorded and comes right up to the present day, the author having added a postscript about the current Russian invasion.</p><p id="4889">Several months after I read this book, the brilliant Yale historian of Eastern Europe Timothy Snyder streamed on YouTube a for-credit class entitled The Making of Modern Ukraine. I watched all 20 lectures. The primary textbook for the course was <em>The Gates of Europe</em>. Snyder’s lively chronology added some much needed perspective to the too-dry reading of the book.</p><h2 id="def9">14. Why the New Deal Matters, by Eric Rauchway (2021)</h2><p id="7c30">This book is a survey of the contributions programs of the New Deal made to the United States. Because such contributions are voluminous, a book mentioning every one of them would be thousands of pages, so the author merely presents a representative sample. From electricity to bridges to monuments to theatre to sidewalks, the New Deal made America a much nicer and more supportive place to live. To me, the most striking and wonderful thing about the New Deal was the way it embraced cultural contributions as much as it did infrastructure. In many ways the 1930s understood better than we do today that a sound society is built on more than commerce.</p><h2 id="94c2">15. The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t, by Julia Galef (2021)</h2><p id="178e">This intriguing book discusses how people assess the world around them and how they use that information to form opinions and strategies for life. The author uses a metaphor of scouts versus soldiers: soldiers are given a description of a situation and then told to execute a plan. Scouts, on the other hand, go into the field without a known situation. They are ready to learn and their learning can become the basis for soldierly action. Essentially, soldier mindset is motivated thinking: that is, the soldier tries to fit the observed world into their mental model of what the world should be. Conversely, scouts need tools that allow them to see what is there without forcing it into a pre-conceived narrative. I liked this book.</p><h2 id="25de">16. Moneyland: The Inside Story of the Crooks and Kleptocrats Who Rule the World, by Oliver Bullough (2019)</h2><p id="9e60">While I enjoyed this book a lot, I found it a bit frightening at times. I’ve come to believe that economic inequality is — if not the root of all our troubles — the path to solving all of our troubles. Bullough’s book is a look at how difficult implementing that remedy will be. His central point is that, while laws stop at national borders, money doesn’t. If the thing you want to do with your money is not legal where you live, it’s all too easy to move it somewhere where it is permitted. There are no international controls on the movement of money. If you make a billion through monopoly, bilking widows and orphans, or through plain vanilla genocidal grifting, there’s a place that will house your billion safely and let you spend it without question where ever and on whatever you please. The author calls this stateless state “moneyland.”</p><h2 id="1ea4">17. Red Famine: Stalin’s War on Ukraine, by Anne Applebaum (2017)</h2><p id="2718">In 1932, Josef Stalin, the totalitarian leader of the Soviet Union, decided to collectivize all of the farms in the nation. This was to be an essential proof of the validity of the communist economic system and was projected to increase grain yield by significant amounts. While the agricultural and economic benefits of communist collectivization can be debated endlessly, this particular implementation was a ham-fisted failure and the resultant food shortage was a massive practical and political problem for the relatively new USSR. Stalin decided to solve the political problem by blaming the victims. He demanded impossible amounts of grain, then when the peasant farmers failed to deliver, he accused them withholding their grain to raise prices and extort profits. Stalin then sent cadres of unsavory people into the Ukraine to force the farmers to surrender their non-existant hoards of grain. When the unsavory cadres failed to find grain they knew that Stalin would be unhappy, and that meant death. So they took what grain the peasants had including their seed for next season. They ransacked the peasants houses and stole anything edible. They poisoned wells, killed farm animals, and even confiscated cooking utensils. They created an enormous famine. By the end of 1933, somewhere between four and four-and-a-half million people died a horrible death of starvation. Every trace of this genocidal massacre was erased from the public record and it remained largely unknown until the USSR collapsed in 1991. Slowly, the survivors unearthed evidence and told their stories. The truth of Stalin’s famine, called the Holodomor, has finally emerged into the light. Not only does the author relate this gripping narrative, but in the early chapters she sets the stage with a capsule history of Ukraine and why Stalin resented it so.</p><h2 id="ed9b">18. City of Thieves, David Benioff (2008)</h2><p id="bbf2">I first read this book years ago and loved it. Over the years I’ve recommended it to countless friends, and I looked forward to rereading it someday. This year I managed to find that “someday,” and thoroughly enjoyed it a second time. The novel is a fictionalization of the formative years of Benioff’s grandparents’s lives: when they first met each other during the siege of Leningrad during World War Two. The Nazis starved millions of Russian civilians in Russia’s former capital city during the years-long siege. The citizens, already subject to Orwellian Soviet rule, were starved into death and depravity, which they faced with a combination of black-humored stoicism and Russian ingenuity. Benioff is a Hollywood screenwriter (some years after writing this novel he created the smash TV hit <em>Game of Thrones</em>), so the plot moves smoothly and inexorably through scenes of tender love and grisly death to a satisfying conclusion.</p><h2 id="a589">19. Up Against It, by M. J. Locke (2011)</h2><p id="37df">A plot-driven, hard-science-fiction story. Readable, but not deep. I’d call it a beach book.</p><h2 id="00f7">20. M: Son of the Century: A Novel, by Antonio Scurati (2022)</h2><p id="1b62">It took me many weeks to finish this novel. I suspect my struggle was due to its being an English translation of the original Italian. If I knew more about Italian history and culture the real-life characters and subtle references would have been clearer. With those caveats, the book was worth the effort. It’s a fictionalized account, but it is firmly based in documented history, and covers the years 1919 through 1924. It was in that time that Benito Mussolini, a journalist, a war veteran, and a former socialist, invented modern fascism and took over the reins of power in Italy to rule for the next two decades.</p><p id="5172">Geopolitically, the peninsular nature of the Italian boot makes Italy a sideshow to internecine European wars. Italy could easily have sat out World War One as a neutral. But Italy was once the Roman Empire, and dreams of past glory haunted the nation, and the opportunity for national expansion created by the war’s confusion enticed the Italians. It would have been natural for them to join the Central Powers, the neighboring alliance of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Germany. But Italy waited on the sidelines until they could pick the winner. Somewhat surprisingly, they joined up with the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and Great Britain (and eventually the United States).</p><p id="3c7b">The Italians spent the war engaged in one of the most bullheaded and suicidal campaigns in a war infamous for its bullheaded suicidalness. They assaulted north and east against the Hungarian army that was dug into impregnable mountainous redoubts. For years the Italians threw millions of their best against stony vertical cliffs guarded by deadly machine-guns and artillery. The Italian army made little headway and yet they paid dearly for their failures.</p><p id="6697">No thanks to the Italians, the Entente won the war (no real thanks to the other Entente nations either, mostly the nations of the Central Powers simply retired from the field spent and exhausted), so Italy was — nominally — one of the victors. But to the Italians, in every real way the war felt like a defeat. The territorial gains they hoped to acquire failed to materialize, the respect they wanted from the English and Americans failed to materialize. Their military strategy had failed, the politicians had failed, the economy had failed, the hopes of Italian citizens for a proud new era were dashed, and the veterans who had fought courageously and tenaciously against terrible odds walked home with their heads bowed. It was from these disillusioned victorious/defeated veterans that Mussolini built his fascist movement. The fascist veterans, supported by Italian businessmen, began a nationwide campaign of violence against socialists and communists. Mussolini’s lieutenants created squads of tough, angry, nihilist veterans to roam the countryside, beating and killing anyone who sympathized with socialism. Citizens were cowed by the violence, and eventually the politicians were also. As fascism’s popularity grew, the fascists marched on Rome and forced the King and Parliament to recognize Mussolini and the fascists as their leaders. Adolf Hitler admired Mussolini greatly and modeled his totalitarian state after the Italian leader.</p><h2 id="ba41">21. The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1891)</h2><p id="6840">I first read this book when I was 12 years old. The Old English phrasing, metaphors, and figures of speech were difficult but entrancing. It’s a coming of age novel set during The Hundred Years War in the Europe of the 1360s.</p><p id="ae82">It is unabashedly Anglophilic, glorying in the pastoral beauty of Southern England. It’s filled with quirky but lovable characters, presented in vignettes where good always triumphs and bad behavior is punished. The hero of the novel is Alleyne Edricson, a young man raised inside a catholic abbey sheltered from the complexities and vicissitudes of real life. Upon leaving the abbey he is quickly educated by all of the strange and wonderful people he chances upon. But it is the archer Samkin Aylward, by far the most colorful of the people Edricson chances to meet, who recruits him to join <em>The White Company</em> and follow the famous knight Sir Nigel Loring off to the continent to fight the Spanish and French. The novel follows Alleyne’s adventures across the channel, through France, and into Spain. There are pirates, chivalrous fights, chaste maidens, spooky seers, peasant uprisings, and fierce battles.</p><p id="db18">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is justifiably famous for inventing the world’s most famous crime fighter, the detective Sherlock Holmes. Since <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> was first published in 1887, the character of Sherlock Holmes became widely loved. Doyle responded by writing more Holmes stories, eventually totaling 4 novels and 56 short stories. But Doyle never really liked Holmes all that much, feeling that the detective was keeping him from writing more important works. Eventually, in the 1893 story <em>The Final Problem</em> he threw Sherlock Holmes to his death off the Reichenbach Falls. There was such a public outcry that Doyle had to resurrect Holmes and continue writing about him.</p><p id="8bfd"><em>The White Company</em> is what Doyle meant by “more important works” and he considered this novel his masterwork, an important historical document that extolled the virtues of English chivalry. Today it’s regarded as juvenile fiction too biased and simple to be literature, but even after multiple re-readings over the years, it’s still one of my favorite stories.</p><h2 id="4e11">22. The Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and Their Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow’s World, by Charles C. Mann (2018)</h2><p id="b45c">The human population is exploding and some see this fact as a death knell while others see it as a great opportunity. The author presents both sides of this conundrum through the contrasting biographies of two little-known but highly influential 20th Century scientists, Norman Borlaug and William Vogt. Vogt was a pioneering environmentalist who believed that humankind needed to adapt to the constraints imposed by the natural environment. Borlaug believed that science could innovate humankind out of such constraints.</p><p id="d5ea">The great value of this book is how deeply and how even-handedly the author plumbs the works and the beliefs of these two scientists and their opposing viewpoints. While their names may not be known outside of academic circles, each man had significant effect on the world and their beliefs have spawned organizations and controversies over the years. It would be easy for the author to take sides but he refuses to do so, and it is this impartiality that gives the narrative such power to make the reader reflect on their own prejudices and beliefs.</p><h2 id="1cb1">23. The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front 1915–1919, by Mark Thompson (2009)</h2><p id="98d8">During World War One the Italians attacked north and northeast in a quixotic bid to cross the Isonzo River and conquer the Tyrolian Alps and lands on the north and eastern shores of the Adriatic. They particularly coveted the city of Trieste. The Italians waited on the sidelines of the war until they could pick a winner: the Triple Entente forces of England, France, Russia, and ultimately the United States. But Italy’s performance on the field was incompetent and failed at every battle. None of Italy’s allies liked or respected them, and at war’s end, Italy was shut out of any territorial gains, even those solemnly promised.</p><p id="1fc8">The terrain where the Italian army fought for four long years is stark, rocky, vertical, and deadly. It was called the “white war” because the escarpments were so rocky and bare. Small groups of Hungarian soldiers entrenched in the heights could hold off wave after wave of attacking Italians because they were shooting nearly straight down on the Italians as they tried to climb the rough stone escarpments. The Italian soldiers performed heroically and well, but they were in a no-win situation. The campaign was long, arduous and deadly — nearly 700,000 Italians died — for no practical gains.</p><p id="0486">The references to the Isonzo campaign in the novel <em>M: Son of the Century</em> led me to this non-fiction book. Reading these two books concurrently certainly rounded out my understanding of the motivations of the original fascists. Although technically the victors, the Italians lost everything: their sons, their territory, their treasure, and the respect of their peers. It’s easy to see how Mussolini could entice and mold the dispirited veterans into a band of violent men who cared only to beat people into submission.</p><h2 id="e4fe">24. The Kid Stays in the Picture, by Robert Evans (1994)</h2><p id="894c">I don’t watch a lot of television drama, and I haven’t seen the movie <em>The Godfather</em> for about 30 years, but an advertisement for a new show called <em>The Offer</em> caught my attention. <em>The Offer</em> is a 10-episode mini-series that purportedly tells the story of the making of <em>The Godfather</em> way back in 1972. The series is great! I watched it twice through. I can’t say how well it conforms to reality, but it’s a great story well told. A couple of the characters were really fascinating, particularly Charlie Bluhdorn, the CEO and founder of Gulf+Western, and Bob Evans, the head of production at Paramount Pictures. Both of these men were larger-than-life players and neither took “no” for an answer. Their portrayal in the TV series inspired me to read more about them.</p><p id="a152">Bob Evans genuinely loved making movies, and with the moral and financial support of Bluhdorn, he empowered young writers and filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Al Ruddy, and Mario Puzo to create their best work. This book, <em>The Kid Stays in the Picture, </em>is not well-written and has significant gaps, omissions, and — probably — gross exaggerations, but there’s nothing like reading the man’s own words to get a sense for who he was and what he accomplished. Some years ago the United States Library of Congress compiled a list of the 100 most important movies made in the USA. Evans was proud to point out that he is the only person who has two films on that list: <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Chinatown</em>.</p><h2 id="3eb6">25. American Fascism: How the GOP Is Subverting Democracy, by Brynn Tannehill (2021)</h2><p id="8872">More than any other book I’ve read this year discussing the ills of contemporary America, this one presented the clearest case for how we have come to grief as a nation. Certainly the book is a polemic, but one scrupulously backed by research and presented with clarity and insight. If you want to understand how and why our nation is suffering, this one book will clarify how we got here.</p><h2 id="82ac">26. Falling Free, Lois McMaster Bujold (1988)</h2><p id="4bba">A workmanlike science fiction story.</p><h2 id="7f9d">27. The Big Goodbye: Chinatown and the Last Years of Hollywood, by Sam Wasson (2020)</h2><p id="4f80">Shortly after finishing Bob Evans’s memoir, I read this book about the making of the 1974 hit movie, <em>Chinatown</em>. Unlike Evans memoir, this one is excellent. The author is a pro, the writing is clear, the story is compelling, and the characters are rounded out. Wasson tells the stories of the four men closest to the creation of the movie: the director Roman Polanski, the scriptwriter Robert Towne, the lead actor Jack Nicholson, and the producer Bob Evans. All four men have complex and engrossing life stories, and they came together at a singular moment in Hollywood’s history when a movie like this could be made. Recommended.</p><h2 id="fd24">28. Pastoral Song: A Farmer’s Journey, by James Rebanks (2021)</h2><p id="f9fa">I greatly enjoyed Rebanks’ first book, <em>A Shepherd’s Life</em>, and this book is similar but different. Both books are semi-autobiographical and both talk about how the old ways of agriculture are sustainable while modern methods are not, but this one is more explicit about the process. As usual, it’s a powerful story well-written.</p><h2 id="7362">29. Glucose Revolution: The Life-Changing Power of Balancing Your Blood Sugar, by Jessie Inchauspe (2022)</h2><p id="3897">The author is skilled at explaining complex but vital things about how the food you eat affects your body. The core of the book is a series of “hacks” that you can use to improve those effects, by lessening the bad ones and increasing the good ones. Very helpful stuff.</p><h2 id="e984">30. Been There, Done That: A Rousing History of Sex, by Rachel Feltman (2022)</h2><p id="1b37">An amusingly written survey of the many splendors of sex. Not prurient sex, but sex viewed through the eyes of an amateur scientist. You’ll like it.</p><h2 id="4282">31. Disciplined Minds: A Critical Look at Salaried Professionals and the Soul-battering System That Shapes Their Lives, by Jeff Schmidt (2000)</h2><p id="4be3">This book is a polemic, a screed, a painful yelp, yet its central idea is critical to understanding both the contemporary meritocratic world and why it fails so universally. The author argues persuasively that both the academic and on-the-job training professionals receive is not so much to teach them the “how-to” of their disciplines as much as it is to inculcate in them the values of the owners of the organizations that employ them.</p><h2 id="7864">32. Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right, by Lisa McGirr (2015)</h2><p id="3206">A detailed study of how today’s right wing extremists came into being. After World War II, vast billions of federal dollars flowed into the burgeoning cold war military-industrial complex. Many of those miltech companies were founded in Southern California, particularly in Orange County, just south of Los Angeles. They recruited technical expertise primarily from two regions: the racist south, and the christian fundamentalist midwest. Both of these inherently conservative groups populated the newly built tracts of low-slung ranch houses with their sliding glass doors, prominent lawns, and sparkling swimming pools. Their owners, lately from bitterly cold Iowa or oppressively hot Texas, reveled in their good fortune. Rather than attributing their improved lifestyles to government largesse, they credited their own efforts, thus giving birth to modern libertarianism. Because they knew their livelihood depended on the cold war, they naturally adopted a rabid anti-communist stance. They entered politics with local school board races, then graduated to backing Goldwater, Nixon, and Reagan.</p><p id="286f">This book strongly buttresses Heather Cox Richardson’s arguments in her excellent book <em>How the South Won the Civil War</em>.</p><h2 id="9855">33. Miss Kopp Investigates, by Amy Stewart (2021)</h2><p id="bb11">Another amusing chapter in the on-going story of the amazing Kopp sisters. Set in 1919, the war has ended and the three sisters are back together again. This volume focuses on the youngest sister, Fleurette. With health problems stymieing her plans for a singing career, she inadvertently gets involved in sleuthing work. All of Stewart’s Kopp novels are sweet, gentle, historical, and readable.</p><h2 id="bf9f">34. The Fifth Risk, by Michael Lewis (2018)</h2><p id="b124">Apparently lacking a center of gravity, this book meanders along leisurely, and yet the author’s deft descriptions are powerful enough to keep the reader turning pages. Through the use of brief biographies of seemingly unremarkable characters, the book describes a few of the most vital yet most obscure functions of the United States Federal Government. Just as the author makes clear the breadth and importance of these functions, he juxtaposes it with the right-wing extremist forces working diligently to destroy them.</p><h2 id="de25">35. Tomorrow The World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy, by Stephen Wertheim (2020)</h2><p id="0c16">A scholarly book that describes in detail how a cadre of thinkers and politicians in the United States government changed the course of world history and America’s role in it. Even before the tide began to turn in the favor of the Allies during World War II, forward thinkers grasped the looming opportunity offered by the massive restructuring of global power that would occur in the wake of the war. In a few short years, they conscientiously converted the determinedly isolationist United States into the largest and most successful world power. After World War I, President Woodrow Wilson’s <em>League of Nations</em> fell flat on its face. Even the United States didn’t join. By contrast, in the 1940s, the architects of post-war America created the successful <em>United Nations. </em>America not only accepted its new role as world leader, but most of the rest of the world did too.</p></div><div><p id="2e37"><em>I hope you find a title in this list that sparks your imagination.

The totalizing consumerist embrace. The blunt-force, world-warping, escapist delight. I have known theme parks with entrance gates like international borders and ticket prices like mortgage payments and parking lots the size of Cleveland. I have been to Disney World, an alternate reality that basically occupies its own tax zone, with its own Fire Department and its own agriculture — a place where, before you’ve even entered, you see a 100-foot-tall electrical pole along the freeway with Mickey Mouse ears. This is a theme park’s job: to swallow the universe. To replace our boring, aimless, frustrating world with a new one made just for us.</p><p>Imagine my confusion, then, when I arrived at Ghibli Park, Japan’s long-awaited tribute to the legendary animation of Studio Ghibli.</p><p>Like filmgoers all over the world, I had been fantasizing about a visit to Ghibli Park since the project was announced more than five years ago. I tracked the online rumors, inhaled the concept drawings, scrutinized the maps. Ghibli’s animation has always felt destined to be turned into a theme park. Hayao Miyazaki, the studio’s co-founder, is one of the all-time great imaginary world-builders — right up there with Lewis Carroll, Jim Henson, Ursula K. Le Guin, Charles Schulz, Maurice Sendak and composers of the Icelandic sagas. Even Miyazaki’s most fantastical creations — a castle with giant metal chicken legs, a yellow bus with the body of a cat — feel somehow thick and plausible and real.</p></div><div><p>Miyazaki started Studio Ghibli in 1985, out of desperation, when he and his co-founders, Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki, couldn’t find a studio willing to put out their work. The films were brilliant but notoriously artsy, expensive, labor-intensive. Miyazaki is maniacally detail-obsessed. He agonizes over his children’s cartoons as if he were Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel. He will pour whole oceans of effort and time and money into the smallest effects: the way a jumping fish twists as it leaps, individual faces in a crowd reacting to an earthquake, the physics of tiles during a rooftop chase scene. Miyazaki insists that, although few viewers will be conscious of all this work, every viewer will feel it. And we do. Those tiny touches, adding up across the length of a film, anchor his fantasies in the actual world.</p><p>“Ghibli” is an Italian word, derived from Arabic, for a hot wind that blows across Libya. The plan was for the company to blow like a hot wind through the stagnant world of animation. It succeeded. For more than 35 years, Studio Ghibli has been the great eccentric juggernaut of anime, cranking out classic after odd classic: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/18/movies/review-film-animated-adventure-fantasy-from-japan.html" title="">“Castle in the Sky”</a> (1986), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/14/movies/review-film-even-a-beast-is-sweet-as-can-be.html" title="">“My Neighbor Totoro”</a> (1988), “Kiki’s Delivery Service” (1989), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/01/movies/review-only-yesterday-isao-takahatas-time-jumping-anime.html" title="">“Only Yesterday”</a> (1991), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/27/movies/film-review-waging-a-mythic-battle-to-preserve-a-pristine-forest.html" title="">“Princess Mononoke”</a> (1997), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/20/movies/film-review-conjuring-up-atmosphere-only-anime-can-deliver.html" title="">“Spirited Away”</a> (2001). In Japan, the release of a new Ghibli film is a national event, and the studio’s most popular characters are ubiquitous: plump Totoro, mysterious No Face, the grinning Cat Bus, googly-eyed soot sprites. As a kind of shorthand, Miyazaki is often called the Walt Disney of Japan.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-totorowaitingforbusstill/19mag-ghibli-totorowaitingforbusstill-superJumbo-v2.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106175_1_19mag-ghibli-totorowaitingforbus_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>Waiting for the Cat Bus in “My Neighbor Totoro.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I was dying to see, in person, how a Ghibli theme park might work. How could these surreal worlds possibly be translated into reality? What would it feel like to lose ourselves inside them?</p><p>In November, when Ghibli Park finally opened, I made sure to get myself there. And so, after many years, and much traveling — at long last — I found myself stepping into the wonders of Ghibli Park.</p></div><div><p>Or did I? Did I find myself stepping into the wonders of Ghibli Park?</p><p>My first impression was not awe or majesty or surrender or consumerist bliss. It was confusion. For a surprisingly long time after I arrived, I could not tell whether or not I had arrived. There was no security checkpoint, no ticket booths, no ambient Ghibli soundtrack, no mountainous Cat Bus statue. Instead, I found myself stepping out of a very ordinary train station into what seemed to be a large municipal park. A sea of pavement. Sports fields. Vending machines. It looked like the kind of place you might go on a lazy weekend to see a pretty good softball tournament.</p><p>There were some buildings around, but it was hard to tell which of them might or might not be Ghibli-related. In the distance, the arc of a Ferris wheel broke the horizon — but this, I would discover, had nothing to do with Ghibli Park. I wandered into and out of a convenience store. I saw some children wearing Totoro hats and started to follow them. It felt like some kind of bizarre treasure hunt — a theme park where the theme was searching for the theme park. Which was, in a way, perfectly Studio Ghibli: no pleasure without a little challenge. And so I headed down the hill, trying to find my way in.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-03/19mag-ghibli-03-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-03/19mag-ghibli-03-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-03/19mag-ghibli-03-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><img alt="A photograph of children walking along a path in the woods.

Critics all over the world simultaneously fell out of their armchairs to praise it in the most ecstatic possible terms. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa21f414-93fa-4fa0-a597-a2b3f7a15572" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nigel Andrews of The Financial Times rated it</a> six out of five stars, justifying this mathematical impossibility (“Exception must be made for the exceptional”) with a flood of rapturous beat poetry: “What is the film about? It is about 122 minutes and 12 billion years. It sums up all existence and gives us a mythology good for every society, amoebal, animal or human, that ever lived.” And he offered the ultimate existentialist blurb: “Rush now while life lasts.”</p></div><div><p>I, on the other hand, am not a film critic. I am an ordinary American, someone raised on MTV and “S.N.L.” and CGI. Which means that my entertainment metabolism has been carefully tuned to digest the purest visual corn syrup. Sarcastic men with large guns. Yearning princesses with grumpy fathers. Explosive explosions explosively exploding. When I watched “Spirited Away,” at first I had no idea what I was looking at. In the simplest terms, the film tells the coming-of-age story of a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro. It takes place in a haunted theme park — where, almost immediately, Chihiro’s parents are turned into pigs, and Chihiro is forced to sign away her name and perform menial labor in a bathhouse for ghosts (ghosts, spirits, monsters, gods — it’s hard to know exactly what to call them, and the film never explains). A full plot summary would be impossible. The story moves at a strange, tumbling pace, with elements connecting and separating and floating around, revolving and recombining, as if in a dream.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-bathhousestill/19mag-ghibli-bathhousestill-superJumbo-v2.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106176_1_19mag-ghibli-bathhouse_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>A bathhouse for ghosts in “Spirited Away.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>But plot isn’t really the point. The majestic thing about “Spirited Away” is the world itself. Miyazaki’s creativity is radically dense; every little molecule of the film seems charged with invention. The haunted bathhouse attracts a proliferation of very weird beings: giant yellow ducklings, a sentient slime-blob, fanged monsters with antlers, a humanoid radish spirit who appears to be wearing an upside-down red bowl for a hat. There is a trio of green disembodied heads, with black mustaches and angry faces, who bounce around and pile up on top of one another and grunt disapprovingly at Chihiro. There are so many creatures, stuffed into so many nooks and crannies, that it seems as if Miyazaki has been spending multiple eternities, on multiple planets, running parallel evolutionary timelines, just so he can sketch the most interesting results. As a viewer, you have to surrender to the abundance. Crowd-surf into the hallucination.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-sootspritesstill/19mag-ghibli-sootspritesstill-superJumbo-v2.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106177_1_19mag-ghibli-sootsprites_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>Chihiro and the soot sprites in “Spirited Away.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Miyazaki knows that his work can be difficult — and he is, at all times, righteously defiant. “I must say that I hate Disney’s works,” he once declared. “The barrier to both the entry and exit of Disney films is too low and too wide. To me, they show nothing but contempt for the audience.” At home, Miyazaki is a celebrity, recognizable to the point of parody: caterpillar eyebrows, heavy, dark-rimmed glasses, sculpted white beard, cigarette. In 2019, the TV network NHK — Japan’s rough equivalent to the BBC — <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/program/video/10yearshayaomiyazaki/?type=tvEpisode&amp;" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aired a four-part documentary chronicling Miyazaki’s creative process</a>. It is a festival of grouchy agony, full of insults (“He’s not an adult yet,” he says of his then 39-year-old son Goro) and self-reproach (“I feel like a comb with missing teeth”). Miyazaki is the curmudgeon’s curmudgeon. Over the decades, he has dismissed everything from iPads (“disgusting”) to 1980s Japanese animation (“resembles the food served on jumbo-jet airliners”) to art created by artificial intelligence (“I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself”). Many artists have high standards. Miyazaki’s are in outer space.</p><p>Disney is, famously, a vast corporate content farm, with all artistic choices carefully examined by an assembly line of executives, marketers, focus groups, etc. Whereas Miyazaki’s vision is absolutely his own. Despite its global success, Studio Ghibli has remained quirky and unpredictable, a direct reflection of the personalities of its founders. To this day, Miyazaki insists on meticulously hand-drawing his own storyboards. When his sketches go to Ghibli’s larger team for the technical work of animation, he checks every image, and if he sees something he dislikes he will erase it and draw right over it — explaining the whole time why it was wrong. For as long as he possibly could, Miyazaki resisted computer animation. He still refuses, on principle, to make sequels. He has long told parents that children should not watch his films more than once a year. (“Whatever experiences we provide them,” Miyazaki has said, “are in a sense stealing time from them that otherwise might be spent in a world where they go out and make their own discoveries or have their own personal experiences.”)</p></div><div><p>Miyazaki is now 82. He has tried multiple times, without success, to pass the creative torch. “I trained successors, but I couldn’t let go,” he once said. “I devoured them. I devoured their talent. ... That was my destiny. I ate them all.” Even his elder son, Goro, has tried his hand at directing — with mixed results. Miyazaki has abruptly retired, and then just as suddenly unretired, by my count, four times. He is currently finishing work on a new film titled “How Do You Live?” It is now in production and should be out in Japan this summer.</p><p>All of which raises some huge questions for Studio Ghibli — questions so deep they are practically theological. What will happen to the company when the great Miyazaki is gone? Can such idiosyncratic imaginative worlds outlive the mind that made them? Would a theme park help (as it did for Walt Disney) to answer both of those questions?</p><p>“Spirited Away” is now more than 20 years old. Since that first confused encounter, I have watched it many, many times. I still find it strange and scary and disorienting — but also uplifting. Despite his crankiness, Miyazaki has always defined his artistic mission in inspirational terms. “I want to send a message of cheer to all those wandering aimlessly through life,” he has written. So when the real world gets bad — when I feel depressed, stressed, misanthropic, crushed by politics or deadlines — I often find myself stepping once more into Chihiro’s world. I find myself wanting to float around in Miyazaki’s imagination as the spirits float in the herbal pools of the “Spirited Away” bathhouse. I want to snuggle into the world of Ghibli like Totoro snuggling into a bed of ferns.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">An elevator tower renovated to include elements from films like “Castle in the Sky.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><strong>‘‘Do you recognize this?”</strong> one of my Ghibli Park guides asked me.</p><p>I did. Of course I did.</p><p>We were staring at a big old-fashioned Japanese gate: red, with dark brown wood and a green tile roof. It was a structure straight out of “Spirited Away.” Waiting on the other side, framed perfectly in the doorway, was one of my favorite things in all of Miyazaki: a squat stone statue, inscrutable and smiling.</p></div><div><p>My guides were two friendly members of Ghibli’s P.R. team, Mai Sato and Seika Wang. I met them up at the train station, after I finished puttering around the area, lost. They confirmed that yes, I had come to the right place. Unlike any theme park I’d ever been to, Ghibli Park was located inside a larger park, Expo 2005 Aichi Commemorative Park. And, like a very polite houseguest, it had tucked itself in without making much of a fuss. Its signage was subtle, and its attractions were spread around, at great distances from one another. The guides told me that our tour would take approximately four hours.</p><p>As my body passed through the “Spirited Away” gate, I felt a slight, shimmering thrill. That smiling statue on the other side was a spirit shrine, guardian of the other world — the first real sign, in the film, that Chihiro’s life is about to be transformed. As we approached, I wanted to stop and take a selfie and text it to everyone I know. But other tourists were doing that, and more people, over to the side, were waiting politely for their turn. So the guides and I walked on.</p><p>This is when we entered the forest.</p><p>If you want Miyazaki to love you, it might help to be a tree. He has a well-documented reverence for nature. Rivers and mountains and oceans are practically the heroes of many Ghibli films. Miyazaki’s forests are so distinctive that certain mossy shades of green automatically make me think of them. In fact, Miyazaki often compares storytelling itself to a tree. It’s not just about flashy ornamentation, he likes to say, it’s about the deep invisible roots that support the trunk that supports the branches — all of which, in the end, allows you to hang the ornaments that everyone will admire.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-treesstill/19mag-ghibli-treesstill-superJumbo-v2.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106178_1_19mag-ghibli-trees_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>Totoro, Satsuki and Mei with trees in “My Neighbor Totoro.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Ghibli Park was designed, as <a href="https://ghibli-park.jp/en/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the official website puts it</a>, in “close consultation with the surrounding forest.” My guides told me that, amazingly, not a single tree was cut down. Again I thought of Disney World, which was created at the expense of whole ecosystems — square miles denatured and paved to make way for lucrative, user-friendly worlds of plastic and metal. Ghibli Park, by contrast, is largely unchanged forest. Seeing its attractions involves walking, endlessly, through wooded paths. Some of those paths are new or recently improved. But many seem old. The forest’s trees were thin and twisty; they stretched over our heads like sunlit hallways. They tangled off into the distance. They just stood there, being trees. Staircases, wooden and stone, branched off up and down hills. Without my guides, I would have had no idea where to go. As we walked, the American in me kept wondering about lawsuits. Surely, someone would someday trip on a root and fall down a staircase. And wouldn’t that person blame Ghibli Park? At one point, we saw a warning sign, attached to a post, telling people to beware of snakes and hornets. It listed a phone number to call if you got into trouble.</p></div><div><p>Months before, in my first meeting with Studio Ghibli’s P.R. team about a possible visit, I was told that the studio would be happy to work with me but had one serious concern. If The New York Times published an article about Ghibli Park, they said, it might make more people want to come visit. This struck them as a problem. Like many Ghibli products, Ghibli Park is impishly non-user-friendly. This is true for people in Japan, and even more so for international visitors. Consider, for instance, its location. Unlike Tokyo Disneyland or Universal Studios Japan (in Osaka), Ghibli Park is not located in a tourist hub. Instead, it sits on the outskirts of an unglamorous city called Nagoya, in a region famous for being the home of Toyota — basically, the Detroit of Japan. And the park is not even in Nagoya proper. From my hotel in the center of the city, it took me an hour, and three different trains, to reach Ghibli Park. The website suggests taking the train because the park has no dedicated parking lot.</p><p>The website also does its best to lower expectations, declaring immediately, “There are no big attractions or rides in Ghibli Park.” The surrounding grounds are public and free to walk around, all day long. There are only three paid areas in Ghibli Park, and by theme-park standards the admission fees are laughably low: the equivalent of about $10 to $20 for each area. But tickets, at that time, were nearly impossible to get. There was a lottery system, and they were sold out for months in advance.</p><p>Occasionally, my guides would lead me to a modest little statue. “Do you recognize this?” they would ask. And it would be something from a Ghibli film: sitting on a bench, Mei’s hat and ear of corn from “My Neighbor Totoro”; standing near a tree, a tanuki from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/movies/pom-poko-directed-by-isao-takahata.html" title="">“Pom Poko”</a>; on a table, Sosuke’s bucket from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/movies/14ponyo.html" title="">“Ponyo.”</a> There are 15 of these objects, they told me, scattered throughout the park. A little fan-service scavenger hunt. I would pause, identify the item and take a photo. Other tourists would stop and do the same. And then we would all keep walking through the trees.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-pompokostill/19mag-ghibli-pompokostill-superJumbo-v2.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106179_1_19mag-ghibli-pompoko_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>Tanuki in “Pom Poko.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>After a while I told my guides, only half joking, that Ghibli Park seemed like an extremely elaborate way to lure people out into the middle of an obscure Japanese forest.</p></div><div><p>Yes, they said. That is basically correct.</p><p><strong>Studio Ghibli did</strong> not offer me an interview with Hayao Miyazaki. He was busy with his final film, and he almost never agrees to do interviews anymore. Besides, they said, Ghibli Park was not really his project. The man in charge was Goro — Hayao Miyazaki’s son.</p><p>In person, Goro Miyazaki is almost the opposite of his father. Miyazaki the elder is a spectacle — perpetually in motion, smoking and agonizing and clutching his hair. He looks like a Miyazaki character. Goro, by contrast, looks like an absolutely normal man. He is 56, clean-shaven, slim. He sits still and speaks softly, modestly, with none of his father’s bombast. His eyes are like deep pools.</p><p>Goro and I met at Ghibli headquarters, a leafy compound, designed by Hayao Miyazaki himself, that is spread over several blocks of a quiet Tokyo suburb. We sat in a meeting room featuring shelves of animation books and statuettes of Ghibli characters. Goro arrived carrying multiple large folders: his sketches and plans for Ghibli Park.</p><p>The Miyazakis, father and son, have what you might call a fraught relationship. Both men have been surprisingly open about this. During Goro’s childhood, the great animator was mostly absent, cranking out masterpieces. The little boy got to know his father like the rest of Japan, by watching his films. “I just wanted him to be there,” Goro says in the NHK documentary, with great feeling. “He feels alive only when he’s making a film.” And then he adds, resigned, “He can’t change now.”</p><p>“I owe that little boy an apology,” Hayao Miyazaki says.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Goro Miyazaki, son of Hayao, at Studio Ghibli in Koganei, Japan.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Goro, meanwhile, was raised by his mother, Akemi Miyazaki. She taught him to love the outdoors. They were always going hiking, and they spent summers up in her father’s mountain cabin. In high school, Goro joined the mountaineering club. In college, he studied forestry. After graduation, he worked in landscape architecture. In his 30s, Goro led the construction of a quirky little Ghibli Museum in suburban Tokyo, designed by his father, which opened in 2001.</p><p>This is something father and son could share: a reverence for nature. And Goro brought this reverence to his design for Ghibli Park.</p><p>“There was a time when we considered making our own version of Disneyland,” he told me. “Here is the Totoro area. People can ride the Cat Bus. That’s great. But what about the environment around it?”</p><p>After all, the action of “My Neighbor Totoro” is inseparable from its natural setting: thick trees, grass fields, rice paddies. Totoro drops acorns everywhere as a kind of calling card. To love Totoro is to love not just a single creature but a whole habitat.</p><p>“It doesn’t feel right to have that kind of idyllic landscape in a theme park,” Goro continued. “You can’t have a rice field that’s green all year round.”</p></div><div><p>What about plastic? I asked.</p><p>“A plastic rice field contradicts the whole idea of Totoro’s world,” he said.</p><p><strong>In Tokyo, I </strong>went to see Toshio Suzuki, the yin to Miyazaki’s yang, the most important person in the company’s history aside from Miyazaki and Takahata. Although he has held many titles (producer, president), most crucially Suzuki has functioned as a kind of Miyazaki whisperer: a combination of friend, critic, right-hand man, creative consultant, collaborator and business partner. When Miyazaki strains a major deadline, or decides out of nowhere to retire, or when he can’t decide how to end a film — Suzuki is the one who figures out how to make it all OK, to stretch budgets and schedules, to hire or lay off whole teams of people.</p><p>I met Suzuki at his office, the doorway of which features a Totoro welcome mat. We sat together at a long table, speaking through an interpreter.</p><p>While Miyazaki is famously grouchy, Suzuki is open and affable. He has a deep, hearty, easy laugh. He loves to talk — so much so that he hosts his own weekly radio show.</p><p>Suzuki told me that the story of Ghibli Park began, almost by accident, 20 years ago — with a quirky one-off project. It was Suzuki’s idea. For years, he had been fantasizing about building a real-world simulacrum of the cartoon house from “My Neighbor Totoro.” This was partly nostalgia: Suzuki actually grew up, in Nagoya, in a house like that — an old-style Japanese country house, with traditional woodworking. Finally, the real world gave him a perfect excuse. He learned that in 2005 a big World Expo would be held in this municipal park on the edge of Nagoya. Its organizers were inviting companies from around the world, including Ghibli, to create pavilions. And so Suzuki said: Yes. We will build this house.</p></div><div><p>The expo organizers loved the idea. Maybe you could put a Totoro in the house, they said. Or some of those cute little soot sprites.</p><p>No! Suzuki said. (In our interview, he actually yelled this right out loud, in English: “No!”) He was only interested in building the house. No characters. Nothing fantastical. Just the house! To this day, Suzuki is not sure why he was so adamant about that. He insists it was not some great principled stand. He just felt like saying no. When it came time to name the place, he didn’t name it after Totoro — he named it after the film’s two human children. “Satsuki and Mei’s House.”</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-housestill/19mag-ghibli-housestill-superJumbo.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106180_1_19mag-ghibli-house_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>Satsuki and Mei arriving at their house in “My Neighbor Totoro.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>To build the house, Suzuki enlisted Goro. Goro may not have had his father’s animation genius — no one really did — but he had other things. A similar obsession with detail. An iron will. Goro knew construction. He had a good practical head on his shoulders. He had built the Ghibli Museum. He would be able to solve any logistical problems. And he had people skills that his father lacked.</p><p>“The one thing that’s very different from Goro to his father, what sets them apart, is how they use staff members,” Suzuki told me. “Hayao Miyazaki is maybe not a great leader. But Goro is very good at making the team function. He’s very good at bringing the best out of each team member.”</p></div><div><p>The whole Totoro house project was a lark. Would the public even be interested in visiting an elaborate wooden replica of a house from a cartoon? Suzuki had no idea. But popularity wasn’t really the point. The impulse was deeper than that.</p><p>Well, it turned out that the public was interested. In 2005, when the World Expo opened, Satsuki and Mei’s House was an instant sensation. Such huge floods of Miyazaki fans poured in that everyone worried the house would be ruined. Its artisanal woodworking was not designed for so much traffic. They imposed a limit: 800 visitors a day. But the competition for those 800 spots was so fierce that, eventually, the expo instituted a lottery system. On an average day, 600,000 people applied. Everyone in Japan seemed to want to put their physical bodies inside the world of Studio Ghibli.</p><p>Suzuki is still amazed by this. It was just a house! When the expo ended, he said, Ghibli received calls from all over Japan — from north to south, Hokkaido to Okinawa. Everyone wanted Satsuki and Mei’s House to be moved to their city. Suzuki even received a call from the city of Toyota, which was interested in moving the house inside the car company’s headquarters.</p><p>What on earth was this insatiable hunger? I asked Suzuki. Why would so many people go to so much trouble to stand inside an ordinary house?</p><p>It’s an excellent question, he said. In fact, that’s exactly what the head of Toyota asked him. Toyota hoped that, if they could figure out the source of this public frenzy, it might help them sell their next car.</p></div><div><p>But Suzuki had no good explanation. And in the end he told everyone that Satsuki and Mei’s House would stay in Nagoya. Many years later, this odd building would become the anchor, and the guiding spirit, of Ghibli Park.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Satsuki and Mei’s house, an exact replica of the home from “My Neighbor Totoro” (1988).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><strong>Goro started planning</strong> Ghibli Park in 2017. It was similar to Satsuki and Mei’s House — but much bigger, much more complicated. It would require all of his skills. His ability to lead teams of actual humans. His ability to haul his father’s imaginary structures, kicking and screaming, into reality.</p><p>Building that Totoro house, Goro told me, had been an incredible hassle. Architecturally, he discovered, the cartoon structure made very little sense. It was tricky to come up with a design that would be both recognizable to viewers of “My Neighbor Totoro” while also functioning as a real-world house. The traditional woodworking required a highly select group of artisans. They were proud, opinionated and stubborn. They argued with Goro over all kinds of things: the blueprints, the height of the ceilings. They didn’t want to build a temporary structure, so Goro had to promise to protect it even after the expo ended. Studio Ghibli had planned to paint the house when it was finished, to make it look plausibly old. But the artisans hated that idea and insisted on aging it in their own way: burning and rubbing the wood, lacquering it with persimmon juice. To make everything worse, the expo’s roads were blocked by construction, so carpenters had to drag supplies over a hill. Everything took longer than it was supposed to. When the expo auditors saw the expenses, they thought there had to be some mistake. It’s not possible to spend so much money on a single house! they said. We could have built a beautiful modern house for a fraction of this cost.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Inside Satsuki and Mei’s house, where visitors can open drawers and closets and find real dishes in the cupboards.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Nevertheless, Goro persisted. He overcame all the obstacles. He built the imaginary house. Unfortunately, however, that triumph did not last — because somehow, Goro agreed to step out of the real world and into the world of his father. He agreed to direct a Studio Ghibli film.</p><p>It did not go well. Goro’s film, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/movies/13tales.html" title="">“Tales From Earthsea,”</a> lacked the energy that defined his father’s work: the throbbing physicality, the restless joy, the moral ambiguity. It was, to be blunt, stiff and humorless. The villain cackled. The hero was noble. At a screening, Miyazaki walked out after only an hour. “It felt like I’d been in there for three hours,” he said, despondently, before reluctantly heading back in. All of this was captured in the NHK documentary. Still, almost unbelievably, Goro went back for more. He proposed directing a second film. In the end, after some more father-son fireworks, this one, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/movies/from-up-on-poppy-hill-written-by-hayao-miyazaki.html" title="">“From Up on Poppy Hill,”</a> was — thank the Forest Spirit — much better than his first.</p><p>And then came this huge undertaking of Ghibli Park. A theme park, in a way, had higher stakes for Goro Miyazaki than any single film. This would be a public, physical, visitable, globally anticipated translation of his father’s imaginative worlds. And Goro would be absolutely in charge.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">A detail in Satsuki and Mei’s father’s study.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><strong>Eventually, after our</strong> very long walk through the forest, my guides and I arrived at Satsuki and Mei’s House. As an attraction, it is hilariously minimalist — almost more conceptual art about a theme-park attraction than a proper attraction in itself. It’s as if a giant hand reached into the film, plucked just this building out and set it down in a clearing in this forest. We stepped inside. The house was clean, small and crowded. Visitors had removed their shoes, as if they were visiting a real person’s home. And everyone was just doing house things: opening drawers, opening closets, turning faucets on and off. The place had been arranged, with perfect realism, as if a Japanese family actually lived there. Tatami mats covered the floor. Dishes filled the cupboards. I slid open a closet. Nice, actual blankets, folded neatly, sat on the shelves. The bathroom had a big round tub just like the one in the film. Outside, the yard featured a working water pump: pull the handle, watch it flow.</p></div><div><p>There was not a single image of Totoro — the most beloved of all the Studio Ghibli characters, the company’s equivalent of Mickey Mouse. Nor could I find any soot sprites. I stepped outside. On one side of the house, down at the ground, people were lining up to peek into a dark hole. In the film, this is the portal through which Totoro emerges. I got in line. Surely there would be a Totoro here. A pair of eyes at least. Finally! I thought. Ghibli Park had made me work for it, but I had found a Totoro. I waited my turn. I bent down. The hole was empty.</p><p>When I told Goro about this experience, he seemed pleased.</p><p>“We wanted to do something authentic,” he said. “Once you try to bring Totoro into reality, you can only do it with a doll, or a robot, or someone dressed as Totoro. It would just lose authenticity. I felt that it was more important to have the building give the <em>feeling</em> that Totoro might be there. When you sit in that tatami room, or if you look under the stairs, you feel like he might be hiding.”</p><p><strong>The most theme-park-like</strong> area of Ghibli Park — the place that you will see all over Instagram — is called Ghibli’s Grand Warehouse. From the outside, it absolutely lives up to that name. It is a big giant warehouse: hulking, boxy, utilitarian. It looks as if it might contain a municipal swimming pool — which, in fact, it once did. (An identical building, right next door, still contains an ice rink.) Now the building is stuffed with Ghibliana: a dense bonanza of references and tableaus and scale-model buildings. It is colorful chaos. There are fountains and staircases and bright mosaics with Ghibli’s signature creatures worked into the patterns. There is a children’s play area featuring Totoro and a giant Cat Bus. There is a grand old-fashioned theater that plays charming short films never released in theaters. (I saw one about a group of preschoolers who imagine their way out onto the open sea, where they lasso a smiling whale.)</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-princessmononokestill/19mag-ghibli-princessmononokestill-superJumbo.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106181_1_19mag-ghibli-princessmononoke_wg_720p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>Princess Mononoke</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The Grand Warehouse’s main draw was an exhibition called, wonderfully, “Exhibition: Becoming Characters in Memorable Ghibli Scenes.” It is a series of life-size tableaus from beloved Studio Ghibli films into which visitors can insert themselves. You can run on top of a giant fish with Ponyo, pose with a robot from “Castle in the Sky,” enter the cluttered clubhouse in “From Up on Poppy Hill” or stand with the hunters from “Princess Mononoke.” Or, the most popular choice, you can sit on the train next to No Face.</p></div><div><p>Let’s pause here, briefly, to make sure we all fully appreciate No Face. The very best Miyazaki characters, the ones that hit on the deepest spiritual levels, are the ones that do not speak. Totoro, the Cat Bus, soot sprites, kodama (the little rattle-headed forest spirits in “Princess Mononoke”). And the greatest of all these — one of the great strange miracles in the history of cinema — is No Face. No Face is a lonely ghost who appears, out of thin air, in the middle of “Spirited Away.” He is so simple and deep, so eloquently silent, that it is hard to even describe him. Words themselves hesitate. This, in fact, is partly what No Face is about: the failure of language. He speaks in incoherent monosyllables (“eh, eh, eh”) — tender little noises that nudge their way toward language but never quite get there. And yet his sounds are full of feeling, full of all that wants to be expressed but can’t.</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">An exhibit in the Grand Warehouse with No Face, from ‘‘Spirited Away’’ (2001).</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>No Face, in other words, is quintessential Miyazaki. In a 2002 interview, Roger Ebert told Miyazaki he loved the “gratuitous motion” in his films, the way “sometimes people will just sit for a moment, or sigh, or gaze at a running stream, or do something extra, not to advance the story but only to give the sense of time and place and who they are.” To which Miyazaki responded: “We have a word for that in Japanese. It’s called <em>ma</em>. Emptiness. It’s there intentionally.” Miyazaki clapped his hands. “The time in between my clapping is <em>ma</em>,” he told Ebert. “If you just have nonstop action with no breathing space at all, it’s just busyness.”</p><p>No Face is <em>ma</em> come to life. He is a living negation, an absent presence — a character so minor that he becomes extremely major. His body is a big black swoop. His face is a white mask, in which the eyes and mouth are just black holes. No Face’s body is semitransparent, so you can actually see the background right through him.</p><p>This was the one experience I absolutely wanted to have at Ghibli Park, the thing I had been fantasizing about from thousands of miles away: to sit next to No Face. I wanted to enter Miyazaki’s most iconic scene: No Face, sitting, expressionless, on a red velvet seat on an ethereal train near the end of “Spirited Away.” I needed to sit there with him, to put my real 3-D body next to his fake 3-D body. I needed to feel that I was gliding over the water, lonely but not alone, on his sad hopeful journey.</p></div><div><figure aria-label="media" role="group" data-testid="VideoBlock"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/19/magazine/19mag-ghibli-trainstill/19mag-ghibli-trainstill-superJumbo.jpg"/></p><video data-testid="cinemagraph" src="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2023/02/10/106182_1_19mag-ghibli-train_wg_1080p.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""></video></div></div><figcaption><span>Chihiro with No Face in “Spirited Away.”</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span></span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Unfortunately, this turned out not to be possible. Everyone else in Japan seemed to have come to Ghibli Park to take this photo. The line seemed infinite. My guides simply acknowledged that, given the time constraints of our tour, the wait would be too long. (They did not offer, even for a second, to let me cut the line, which I appreciated, because I almost certainly would have done it, thereby violating the whole anti-greed ethos of “Spirited Away.”)</p><p>As a consolation, my guides took my photo in a different tableau, one with a very short line. It was the climactic scene from “Porco Rosso,” Miyazaki’s story of an Italian pig-pilot. This is not one of my favorite Ghibli films, but I would take what I could get. In the tableau, a huge crowd cheers as Porco, his face battered and swollen, throws a punch. I stepped into the fight, tilting my body to absorb Porco’s punch, pretending to punch him back. It felt completely ridiculous. The P.R. team took my photo. It looks as ridiculous as I felt.</p><p>I left the Grand Warehouse feeling — I have to say — mildly disappointed. I had not sat with No Face. Nor had I enjoyed the concession stand that offers, as the website puts it, “local milk in a glass bottle with an original design.” (Another infinite line.) Despite all its color, the Grand Warehouse felt static, plastic, a little anticlimactic. Unlike in Ghibli’s films, nothing moved. Part of me — again, the American part — had been expecting to be shocked, entertained, thrown around. It was hard to imagine Hayao Miyazaki, the genius world-builder, the man obsessed with motion, building a place so oddly still. He would have built a rollicking theme park.</p><p>In fact, Toshio Suzuki told me, that had once been his plan. Not many people knew this, Suzuki said, but a long time ago Hayao Miyazaki went to Disneyland. And he loved it.</p></div><div><p>“He kept it to himself,” Suzuki said. “He never said that at home — that he had fun at Disneyland. But I know what happened.”</p></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">The Cat Bus, an interactive exhibit taking children into the world of “My Neighbor Totoro.’’</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In fact, Miyazaki had so much fun that he came back to Japan dreaming of building a theme park of his own. He sketched secret plans of Ghibli-themed roller coasters. Suzuki saw them. But these plans never came to pass. Goro wasn’t interested.</p><p>The Grand Warehouse, Goro told me, was motionless by design. He felt that even the most advanced theme-park effects — rides, virtual reality — could never compare with the experience of watching Studio Ghibli’s films. So he didn’t even try. The absence of attractions, the lack of motion in the Grand Warehouse — it was all perfectly intentional.</p><p>“It’s the visitors that create the motion,” he said. “The characters don’t move, so the visitors have to move themselves. People get very creative, interacting with the scenes. Whether you enjoy it or not — and how you enjoy it — is up to you. And I think that is more Ghibli-esque.”</p></div><div><p>A couple of weeks before it opened, Miyazaki visited Ghibli Park. Toshio Suzuki went with him.

It involved no lines, no merch, no Miyazaki characters — and yet somehow it felt steered, or framed, or made possible, by Miyazaki. Back at the train station, after my tour, I said goodbye to my guides. Then I turned and walked, over the sea of concrete, back down the hill. Past the Grand Warehouse, through the “Spirited Away” gate. And I followed the path back into the forest. The forest was, after all, the whole point of this park, its inspiration — the thing that father and son could always absolutely agree on.</p><p>I plunged into the trees and started wandering at random. The forest was not, like so many of the forests in Miyazaki’s films, ancient and primeval. It was younger, more modest. World War II left Nagoya and its surroundings in ruins. The city was destroyed by bombs. The trees were cut down. Much of the soil had been stripped to make clay. This forest was planted, in the years following the war, as an intentional act of recovery. Since then, these trees had been struggling to grow in that white, clay-heavy soil. That’s why they looked the way they did: lean, hungry, twisting. They had to work harder than trees in other places. This is part of why Goro was determined not to cut down a single one. When a few trees got in the way of Ghibli Park’s construction, he had them carefully moved.</p></div><div><p>I kept walking. I scaled steep wooden stairways. Very few other people were out hiking, so most of the time it felt as if we were all alone, me and the trees. I considered the Japanese term “forest bathing” — the notion that walking through trees cleanses your soul. I walked on boardwalks that stretched up toward the canopy. I thought about how this was a place I never would have visited in 100 lifetimes — this unfamous small forest in a municipal park on the outskirts of an industrial city in Japan. And how this was exactly Goro’s plan: to lure people here with the promise of Ghibli’s imaginary world — and then to give them this real one. This place was real, and I was real, and those two realities were overlapping. Trees, trees, trees. It was entirely up to me where to go, what to look at, when to leave.</p><p>I stopped to watch a spider working in some upper branches, building a large web, twisting and prancing, silhouetted against the blue sky. I passed clusters of fallen acorns on the ground — the forest replenishing itself — and they made me think about Totoro, and thinking about Totoro made me notice more acorns, and soon I stooped to collect some. I filled my pockets. I was happy. And it struck me that this was exactly what I went into Miyazaki’s films for, and what Miyazaki’s animation almost paradoxically did for me: It helped me to find reality, to really see it, to experience it as real, ordinary and strange, boring and surprising. Ghibli Park, in its simplicity, honored this spirit completely. Goro’s vision of a theme park was more radical than the grandest roller coaster could ever be.</p><p>As the sun started to set, I followed a steep path to the top of a hill. There was a little clearing with wooden benches. An old informational sign from the World Expo. It looked like a place no one had been in 10 years. I went inside a small wooden building that turned out to be a bathroom. Taped up on a utility closet, with thick green tape, was a single sheet of paper. It seemed to be some kind of sign. I examined it. It showed a blurry photo of a stout monkey, standing on all fours. There was some Japanese text underneath, so I ran it through my phone’s translation app. The sign was a warning for hikers. But in that moment it read to me like a poem, or a whole life philosophy:</p><blockquote><p>Do not make eye contact with monkeys.<br/>Do not feed the monkeys or expose them to food<br/>After a while, we will move. not stimulating please.</p></blockquote><hr/></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">A play area in Ghibli Park’s Grand Warehouse, one of the only conventionally theme-park-like parts of the park.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Rinko Kawauchi for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><hr/><p><strong>Sam Anderson</strong> is a staff writer at the magazine.
