Rather, it&#39;s better to setup a habit and routine, and stick to it for a long time, whether you accomplish anything during that time or not. E.g., work on blah for 30mins, at 9:30pm before sleeping, or at 6am when awake. Don&#39;t change this time, and don&#39;t do more time than originally planned (regardless of progress or lack thereof).<p>Habits are more powerful than self-control and discipline.

I like to simplify these complex topics to myself by gamifying them a little.<p>Imagine every time you make a conscious decision to do something you expend willpower points. You have a only a set number of willpower points a day.</p><p>Some things you like, some things you don&#39;t, and that depends how much they will cost. Choosing not to do something can also costs points, because it&#39;s a habit.</p><p>Habits are a way to reduce or discount this choice associated cost.</p><p>Now, I recently thought a lot about discipline, motivation, dreaming (for the future) and hope. And I think the problem with discipline is that, everyone has a different definition on it, and it also changes between context. Military discipline is not the same as daily discipline. Soldiers are plenty undisciplined in their daily lives.</p><p>When people talk about discipline they think &#34;doing things that one doesn&#39;t want doing&#34; but it&#39;s really not that simple. It all ties to hopefulness and dreaming for the future.</p><p>And s someone who&#39;s experienced this first hand due to a traumatic childhood: People who don&#39;t value themselves won&#39;t be disciplined for their own sakes, but they can be incredibly disciplined for the sake of others. So, there&#39;s a component of seeing value in what you do, or believe that there is value even if you don&#39;t see it.</p><p>So, like everything in life, discipline is multi faceted.</p><p>As an example, people talk about dopamine and motivation, but I&#39;ve realised that it&#39;s probably closely tied to discipline too. You need to be motivated to be disciplined.</p><p>I&#39;ve recently started becoming more &#34;disciplined&#34; by being incredibly intentional about trying to regulate my dopamine baseline throughout the day. I started doing it to feel less miserable throughout the day, but ended up being more disciplined as a side effect. And I&#39;ve also realised that this has increased my daily &#34;willpower&#34; budget from earlier.

However, then I turn to cold water. There&#39;s some research[^1] that shows that this creates an effect of slow dopamine release.</p><p>Next thing to do is be mindful about what gives you dopamine spikes, and how to not have them too often, since if you do it too much your body becomes &#34;used&#34; too too much dopamine. Basically, biology likes homeostasis, so it will find a way to achieve it.</p><p>This includes not drinking coffee too early too, but around midday/noon, and trying to couple coffee with activities you _want_ to enjoy, but not necessarily do, because coffee increases dopamine levels[^2], so it&#39;s &#34;hacking&#34; your brain to consider this reward-seeking behaviour by pairing the artificical dopamine increase with something you would like to enjoy (like say exercise, or learning a new skill, or work). There&#39;s other obvious benefits of caffeine like improved focus and concentration.</p><p>Now, all this might sound like &#34;too much dopamine,&#34; since it&#39;s very &#34;do this that gives you dopamine, do that that give you dopamine&#34;, but it&#39;s not that you&#39;re getting spikes in dopamine like you get from sex (or masturbation, or cocaine, etc), it&#39;s small releases that you strategically pair with activities that are good for you. Over time as they become habits you won&#39;t have to consume willpower for them, and you won&#39;t have to constantly be so intentional about what you do.</p><p>There&#39;s also the other side of the coin, like &#34;reducing&#34; dopamine. Doing stuff that you don&#39;t enjoy can suck, but sometimes that stuff is good for you. This is where the psychological component comes in. Thank yourself (think of yourself as your future self thanking your past/current self) for engaging in these activities after you do them. Gratitude releases dopamine, too[^3]. So the brain then associates this as reward seeking behaviour, and it becomes less hard in the future. It&#39;s not surprise that drug addicts will go to incredible lengths (I was a drug addict myself, so talking first-hand here) to get their substance of choice even if it&#39;s a giant chore and not enjoyable. Why? Reward-seeking behaviour; the reward is the dopamine, the behaviour is getting and consuming the drug. One could say they&#39;re incredibly disciplined to get that high (it&#39;s a weird way of putting it, but alas).</p><p>I&#39;ve also—somewhat unsuccessfully due to the childhood trauma mentioned earlier—tried to pick up mediation. It&#39;s helped me initially with focus and mindfulness, but caused some emotional problems. They are always there, but for a lack of better word, my chaotic mind was probably somewhat of a &#34;defence&#34; mechanism to mitigate CPTSD[^4]. This is a home-brewed theory me and my therapist came to. Going through the stages of grief for my &#34;lost childhood&#34; and my therapist&#39;s open-mindedness to psilocybin-aided therapy helped resolve this. I&#39;ve done Psilocybin later on my own as well, and I&#39;ve managed to make a lot of progress even on my own (but I have to thank my therapist and myself for developing the mental tools to explore those in a productive way). I wouldn&#39;t blanket recommend psychedelics since I&#39;ve had bad trips too, but they&#39;ve helped me immensely.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;ve went a bit on a tangent here. Back to dopamine control. I can luckily now safely meditate without &#34;relapsing&#34;, and that&#39;s helped a lot with focus, energy and overall willpower. It helps because I can choose what to focus on, and my mind is less ADHD-y. So this means you have to spend less &#34;willpower points&#34; on returning your mind to what matters to your &#34;conscious self&#34; (or ego). I don&#39;t know if I have ADHD or not, maybe; but it&#39;s likely related to the stuff I talked about earlier.</p><p>Meditation isn&#39;t very enjoyable for me, but as I started pairing it with gratitude and started seeing incredible benefits in my daily focus after only just about a week or so of daily 10-minute meditations, it&#39;s started to become enjoyable... Interesting even.[^5]</p><p>Listening to music releases dopamine too, but be careful you don&#39;t do too much of &#34;dopamine layering&#34; since the activity might be less enjoyable in the future without all these &#34;helpers&#34;, or it can offset your baseline too much. So, if you&#39;re at the gym for example, listen to music some days, but do a few days where you are doing it without the music. Try (it isn&#39;t always easy) to enjoy the atmosphere of the environment too.</p><p>Always remember to be grateful to yourself after these activities, too. Progress is sometimes too slow to see, and for progress-minded people, it can be a bit discouraging. But the progress is there, even though you might not realise it immediately. Trust yourself you&#39;re doing the right thing if you know it to be right.</p><p>Also, another big component in this whole thing is energy. So make sure your body is treated well in a holistic matter, not just your brain. The body and the brain are a unit, and we often forget that in our day-to-day-lives, I think. So, make sure you get enough sleep, eat healthy. It helps to take probiotics, especially with modern diets; I take mine daily, but you don&#39;t have to be as rigid with it as I am (but I also have digestive issues and my GP suggested probiotics and multivitamins; it helps a lot for me). Drink water, but depending on where you live don&#39;t drink tap water; buy a Brita water jug (or whatever the equivalent is in your region). It&#39;s easier to make tough decisions when you&#39;re not exhausted, and that means you expend much less willpower points when you do make them.</p><p>It&#39;s late and I might&#39;ve forgotten some stuff. I won&#39;t write much more so I don&#39;t risk you or someone else tl-dr-ing this (as I genuinely believe it&#39;s all good advice) but feel free to ask any follow-up questions if you&#39;re interested.</p><p>[^1]: Nicely summarised by Dr Huberman here <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure-for-health-and-performance/" rel="nofollow">https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure...</a></p><p>[^2]: This is well researched I think; just google &#34;coffee dopamine&#34; and take your pick</p><p>[^3]: This is more nuanced. You really need to do this with your full intent behind it. Murmuring a throwaway &#34;thanks buddy&#34; won&#39;t have the same effect. I combined this with journaling. I like to think __why_ was this good for me. Why do I think it helped me, how could it improve my life. Another big component with me is how I can improve the lives of people around me, since I&#39;m a bit of a people pleaser. So, I like to muse on that too. If my life is good, I&#39;m in a position to help others improve their lives, etc.</p><p>[^4]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_...</a></p><p>[^5]: I recommend reading The Mind Illuminated book.

I never look at my feelings, I sit down and do the work no matter what. The concept of having to motivate myself to do something sounds extremely foreign. It&#39;s not just that I&#39;m a workalcoholic, I always end work on time and I always wish I had more time for other things.<p>I have the discipline but I think the key is discipline + actually loving it, loving the thing that you are doing on average. Loving the process of discipline + loving the vision that you are working towards. I think that the passion and inspiration alone are not sufficient because there are always things you don&#39;t want to work on and you may really not feel like it sometimes, on the other hand, discipline for the sake of discipline without appreciation - having to push yourself... no. There must be both push and pull. If you don&#39;t feel any pull or if it&#39;s much weaker than the push then it most likely means that the sacrifice is not worth it or maybe you are doing way too much and not scheduling any time to appreciate the present moment.

To me, it&#39;s certainly not just about programming but the project / product in particular as well as how much ownership / leadership over the thing I would have. If it feels like it&#39;s a part of the bigger picture and I get to develop skills I want to develop, that could be quite fun, even if I was doing it for someone else. My experience to date with other people&#39;s projects was not that exciting though but I liked it because I had the time to work on my own thing alongside. I remember working 2 months on a client&#39;s project exclusively while not having any time for mine, I was approaching 50h/week just for that project. I liked it on average but I remember the last week was tough, I really felt like I had enough and just thinking through some ideas about a potential future product / project felt like gasping for air while being underwater for too long.<p>I think that&#39;s the general theme of this. So long as a significant chunk of the work (i.e. 1/3) is genuinely enjoyable just for what it is, the other, more boring work is also more pleasant because: 1) - it feels like a part of the bigger picture that you like (i.e. whether you are doing something really boring or maybe earning money to buy yourself more time) and 2 - just conditioning, getting good emotions from one part of the work is partially transferred to the boring stuff and it needs to happen on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The fact that there are boring parts to it (which one can still learn to appreciate) provides the contrast and makes the highs much higher. However, there&#39;s also something I did not mention initially. I&#39;m spending considerable time on appreciating the now, I would set aside 40 min every day to do Zen meditation and it really does help with the discipline / will power but perhaps most importantly - appreciating work that&#39;s boring - if I can get myself to enjoy sitting still or walking circles around the room, I can treat boring work not unlike extra Zen practice that sharpens me further. It does not have to be Zen practice but just ensuring that you are spending some time enjoying the now basically every day is critical when you you are often trying to make predictions about the future which is stress and anxiety inducing.

Sure, I know it&#39;s theoretically possible but I can&#39;t image what it takes to get here.<p>This thread has really made me realize what a disability ADHD is. I struggle to watch a movie from start to finish, even one I have been really looking forward to.  I dream of being able to concentrate and work on what I want to do for an entire day.  My ratio at the moment is about 1-2 hours of work in every 8 hour day.

It&#39;s basically a lifestyle of work and not much else, I set aside some time for a hobby which also involves socializing and that&#39;s why it&#39;s 60h/week (63h/week being theoretical max if nothing comes up) and not 70h/week.<p>Hitting the time on a regular day (not every day is like that) requires ongoing effort to sustain it. I spend 20 min / day doing time tracking and performance analysis (I think it makes more time than it costs). So for example if I want to hit 10h on a day which is purely dedicated to work, I wake up at 6, I end work at 8 and go to sleep at 9:30. That gives me 14h between 6 and 8, so it means that the combined time for the morning and midday routines must be under 4h. I don&#39;t stress about doing too little work on any given day, but I will always look at it the next day and consider what I could do better with the execution of the previous day . Then it mostly becomes a habit, I would just do it like a robot. Not every day is like that, but most are.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your disability. I don&#39;t know much about ADHD but perhaps you would find the following tips useful. You could look into Zen meditation - a good book with the how is 3 Pillars of Zen, feel free to discard the supernatural stuff and just focus on regular practice. One of the main benefits of Zen practice is increasing your attention span. It&#39;s extremely challenging to sustain focus on nothing and I still struggle with this despite doing it regularly for 5 years. It could be as simple as counting exhales and resetting the count every 10 breaths, expect to lose track fast but you get better at it with regular practice and this directly translates to your attention span when doing other things. Maybe you could also benefit from journaling - try to successively increase work blocks by a small amount every week or so and keep track of it. Other tips: avoid scrolling social media, get good sleep - you may need up to 8.5h of bed time / 8h of sleep, it&#39;s easy to be chronically sleep depleted without being aware about it and everything is much harder without good sleep, do quick breaks while working, i.e. 1 minute pause every 15 min just looking at the timer (not email!).

    2 motivation 
    3 intention 
    4 discipline 
    5 habit 
    6 passion
</code></pre>
discipline is great but it&#39;s the part that takes willpower and it&#39;s not sustainable so if you don&#39;t like to do something you need the willpower to do it. it&#39;s not gonna last ever day for years. that people have to suffer to sustain things is misguided advice. the math doesn&#39;t check out.<p>sibling comment is correct here, discipline is necessary but only 1/6 of the framework. for long term sustainability we need habits plus higher order reasons to want to do it. passion ideally, or boosts of positive energy from inspiration and motivation.

I may be productive for a week, but sooner or later, something is going to happen that will allow me to procrastinate.

Don&#39;t confuse it with trying multiple implementations of one method - if you tried two to-do list apps and it didn&#39;t work for you, skip the to-do lists and move to something else. My method is body doubling, but YMMV. Once you find a method that works for you, revisit previous productivity methods - they may supplement your productivity

Medication can help, but even with strategies, tactics, and therapy, there is still brain chemistry at play. Medication can help, but has its trade-offs and isn&#39;t a silver bullet.<p>Self-discipline is also more costly. You can brute-force your way through tasks with ADHD, but it is more taxing on your overall energy. Those with ADHD typically experience impulses often and it&#39;s harder for them to ignore. Forcing yourself to ignore them requires extra energy. It&#39;s not sustainable to do all the time. It&#39;s hard for those without ADHD to truly understand what that&#39;s like.</p><p>In addition to impulsivity, executive dysfunction affecting starting tasks or work is also a big challenge.

After two years of IFS therapy my ADD is pretty much non-existent and my executive functioning is better than most people I know.<p>My hunch is that for a lot of people, ADD is a result of growing up in a home that felt unstable so they never gained a basic internal sense of stability that you need for things like task switching or staying focused.

You use the tools you have. If you have ADHD and a situation is unbearable, hyperfocus is a tool you have— or at least a pattern you can fall into— that can prevent you from being overwhelmed by the feelings that weigh on you when that situation is on your mind. It would be shocking to me if ADHDers didn&#39;t often end up relying on features of ADHD to adapt to traumatic situations.</p><p>These things are interrelated in people who have both, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s generally easy (or necessary) to pick apart &#39;which is which&#39; when it comes to a specific behavior or experience.

Let&#39;s say I have to mail a package at the post office. I&#39;ve got to write the address, pack it all up and then take it to the post office.  At 9am in the morning I genuinely feel like I&#39;m on the cusp of doing it.  I glance at my watch &#34;Oh, it&#39;s midday, better each lunch&#34;. No to worry, I&#39;ll get the package done right after lunch.  4pm rolls around and I realize that I might miss the closing time of the post of office so I rush to tape it up, write the address and hurry down there. I send it just in time.  At any time of the day you could have asked me &#34;Are you going to send that package now?&#34; and I would honestly say &#34;Yes, right away!&#34; but somehow it doesn&#39;t happen. On one level I know myself well enough to have seen this play out hundreds of times, but I still think this time will be different. It still feels like I&#39;m just about to send that package.<p>This happened on a much larger scale when I was in university. I had 18 months for my dissertation. Each week that went by I planned to write a small chunk of it, just to get going.  In the end I wrote the entire thing a week before the deadline with my professor literally sitting next to me making me do it.</p><p>&gt; I suspect you will be less likely to feel that inability to get around to do the tasks that you know to be important to do it if you fail in a way that life itself, the universe, hurts you for the failure, as opposed to your boss saying &#34;you&#39;re fired for showing up late&#34;.</p><p>This is true up to a point.  What ADHD people need is consequences ASAP.  Your boss checking in on you every hour and providing constant pressure is much more effective than a meeting at the end of the month where your boss blows his top and fires you because you&#39;ve done very little.

Sometimes I really don&#39;t feel like it, even after all these years, and I complain about it.

It is the case that one may not have a mindset of exclusively complaint, as one may have developed a capacity for more gratitude through the effort of being conscious. As long as there is any energy being exerted for complaint, that is energy that can be conserved and utilized for higher purpose.</p><p>For a complaint to reach all the way through the body and out the mouth, it must have already been processed through the brain. Complaining in all forms is a type of negative expression, and drains energy. The OP was commenting about how they complain going to the gym, at the gym, coming home from the gym, and while showering after the gym. I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking for as a definition of &#39;mindset of complaint&#39;, but this I&#39;d suggest this is suitable.</p><p>You can think of complaining, an expression of negativity, as basically a polar opposite of gratitude. To begin cultivating something of a higher order, it will help to attempt to &#39;reconcile&#39; the feeling of the two by feeling them both simultaneously. When you feel like complaining, or catch yourself doing so, make attempts to begin feeling gratitude. You&#39;ll soon find the gratitude will replace the complaining. After doing this enough, you will develop enough sensitivity and acumen to begin actually feeling both sensations at the same time, holding onto the &#39;complaining&#39; feeling, while reaching toward the gratitude as well. Over time, you will be able to find yourself &#39;integrating&#39; the two faster and faster, nearer the moment the feelings come into consciousness. Eventually (years), your &#39;complaining&#39; will be supplanted and you will have a different mode of experience.

The environment I escaped is the type of environment that books about learned helplessness (a concept at the center of modern therapy) are written about. I mention this only to add context to my personal experience, and to highlight that the mindset I had to escape was ingrained from the earliest age. In short, there was little to no &#34;supporting the development of agency&#34;, and in most cases, the exact opposite was true.<p>The process of therapy, whether that&#39;s CBT, ACT, etc. are all about making incremental changes that eventually all combine to rewire how you think and/or act. The entire therapy journey consists of these kinds of small changes along with active processing of past events to free up mental capacity. I&#39;m highlighting therapy here because the related disciplines have been studied extensively.</p><p>The same concepts apply in other contexts (and are common in fields like software). Outside of traditional methods of therapy, practices like mindfulness meditation have been studied quite a bit, and there is a growing body of research on its benefits [0]. In particular, it seems to lower friction for hard things by helping you see more clearly the reality of why you&#39;re struggling with doing things, and why <i>not</i> doing them is often worse in the long run.</p><p>&gt; <i>I would challenge that from the getgo.</i></p><p>To clarify, what are you challenging, specifically? The idea that small changes are easier to execute than large ones?</p><p>This has been the subject of deep exploration across many walks of life, and on the personal improvement front is at the center of books like Atomic Habits, which itself is based on a foundation of research. The reason small changes work is that we absorb them into our daily routines until they no longer require active thinking to accomplish.</p><p>Part of what happens is that you also start confronting the bad reasoning you&#39;ve been using to justify not acting. Embarrassingly, I had to re-establish basic habits like brushing my teeth. Clarity through mindfulness led to the realization that avoiding the tiny annoyance of doing this each day would be far less painful than the eventual dental issues I would otherwise suffer. I always <i>knew</i> that, but pausing to actually think clearly is what turned that knowing into a deep realization.</p><p>- [0] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_meditation" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_meditation</a> (linking to Wikipedia as a shortcut to the extensive references in the article if you&#39;re curious).

		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>It’s 8.30PM, you’re at your mate’s house hungover as sin and she’s trying to convince you that you’d rather eat a pizza over a Chinese takeaway. “Stop gaslighting me!” you exclaim and everyone in the room laughs. Anyone who has invested a part of themselves into being funny on the internet (AKA all of us) knows this joke. Exaggerating the meaning of gaslighting – a psychology term defined by therapist and behaviour analyst <a href="https://lauriesingerbehavioral.com" target="_blank">Laurie Singer</a> as “when one person is trying to make another person question their own perceptions of reality” – has, for better or worse, become a funny bit. </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Kidding about this serious topic stems from a saturation of people <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmjb9j/how-do-you-tell-the-difference-between-gaslighting-and-just-being-a-dick">misusing the term gaslighting</a> online and in turn, meme-ifying a type of behaviour that is typically done intentionally and as part of a cycle of abuse. It follows a long and ignoble tradition of technical therapy terms being misused online (see: calling <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4aw5y3/self-aware-narcissists-tiktok">influencers clinical narcissists</a>) and treads the line between raising awareness of the behaviour and causing confusion around what it actually entails. To clear matters up, here’s a deep dive into what gaslighting is, what gaslighting isn’t and how to deal with gaslighting if it happens. </p></span></p><p data-component="HeadingBlock"><h2><span>What is gaslighting?</span></h2></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The term itself originates from a play titled <em>Gas Light</em>, premiered in 1938, which was adapted twice for the movies. (The more celebrated adaptation is the 1944 remake <em>Gaslight</em>, starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman, for the pub quiz heads out there.) In each version, the husband is convincing his wife that she’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/21/14315372/what-is-gaslighting-gaslight-movie-ingrid-bergman" target="_blank">gone insane</a> by telling her that she’s imagining things that are actually happening – the crucial one involving the dimming of their home’s gas lights. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As Singer put it earlier, gaslighting is a form of manipulation that tries to influence how another person sees the world around them. It’s done primarily through verbal communication, with the gaslighter making their victim <a href="https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/what-is-gaslighting/" target="_blank">doubt themselves</a> and their memory. </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Over email, interpersonal relationship coach and psychologist <a href="https://www.johnkennycoaching.com/" target="_blank">John Kenny</a> explains that it is, at its core, about control. “Gaslighting is a form of emotional or mental abuse and happens when someone is trying to make you question your own thoughts, actions and emotions in order to gain control over you and your relationship,” he says. “They want you to question yourself so that they can appear to be right all of the time and act as they want around you.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Singer gives this example of gaslighting on a smaller scale: Picture a parent who feels their child eats too much and wants them to eat less. The child says that they’re hungry and the parent responds by saying “You can’t be hungry – you just ate” even though the last time they scoffed anything was three hours ago.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>A parent might be doing this unconsciously, but it’s gaslighting nonetheless. In this situation, they’re not only controlling the food their kid is eating, but controlling how the child perceives their hunger as well as influencing their relationship with food.</p></span></p><p data-component="HeadingBlock"><h2><span>What gaslighting isn’t</span></h2></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>While gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse, all <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmjb9j/gaslighting-in-relationships-and-how-to-tell">emotional abuse</a> doesn’t come under the category of gaslighting. Because gaslighting is a specific behaviour used by one person against another, it’s a little simplistic to call all forms of control gaslighting. It might be fun to laugh at chronic mis-diagnosers online, but we’re not helping abuse victims by continuing to confuse what this term does and doesn’t mean.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Dismissing someone’s opinion, personal attacks like name calling, posturing in a threatening way or even physical abuse” do not count as gaslighting, Singer tells VICE. “Gaslighting is more about a sustained, systematic strategy to try and change someone’s perspective or feelings in a way where they become malleable and dependent. The gaslighter plays on someone’s sense of self-worth and perspectives.”</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Kenny adds: “It can be mistaken for gaslighting when someone is trying to get you to see their point of view, or wants you to act in a certain way and puts pressure on you to do so. This is not gaslighting unless they do this all of the time and go about it in an underhanded way.” He emphasizes the importance of recognising this kind of coercion as an individual moment or a pattern of behaviour – that’s the crucial difference between this kind of heavy-handed persuasion and gaslighting.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In short: Being gaslit isn’t a one-off. It’s a continual <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/is-someone-gaslighting-you-4147470" target="_blank">denial of your recollection of reality</a>.</p></span></p><p data-component="HeadingBlock"><h2><span>Five signs someone is gaslighting you</span></h2></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Kenny has a quick and comprehensive list of signs to look out for if you think you’re being gaslit: </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><ul><li>They never listen to your opinion </li><li>They keep telling you that you’re wrong</li><li>You’re always apologising</li><li>You feel full of self-doubt </li><li>You start relying on them to make your decisions </li></ul></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>If these all add up, it is likely a indication that you are being gaslit. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>When someone – your partner, a friend, a family member – is making you feel unsure of your memories, that’s also a key sign of gaslighting. Reframing the way we think about ourselves is the goal of the gaslighter, and making you see your thoughts and memories as somehow “wrong” is the main way they do this. It can be as simple as telling you that you were embarrassing yourself the night prior because you were blackout drunk, even though you remember being tipsy and having a good time, or deliberately misremembering an argument and accusing you of hurling insults that you never said. These small acts of misrepresentation build up to an assumption that they are usually right and you are usually wrong. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Another tactic to look out for is when someone consistently <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/is-someone-gaslighting-you-4147470" target="_blank">minimizes your feelings</a>. Singer warns to keep an eye out for anyone who “constantly downplays or reframes your emotions”. He adds: “It can come in the form of ‘You’re too sensitive’ or ‘I was just kidding’ or “Relax. It’s not a big deal.” By making you feel like you’re overreacting, the gaslighter can <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvm7gd/how-to-tell-if-youre-dating-a-narcissist">control how you feel</a> about them.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As a natural progression from controlling your emotions and memories, gaslighting also includes shifting the blame. Just like being told repeatedly that you overreact, the gaslighter may also accuse you of being harmful. This could be down to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201702/why-gaslighters-accuse-you-of-gaslighting" target="_blank">projecting their own fears</a> of being an abuser – but it also reinforces your own self-doubt, which they can use to their own advantage.</p></span></p><p data-component="HeadingBlock"><h2><span>What to do if you are being gaslit</span></h2></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Once you’ve recognized you are being gaslit, try to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-deal-with-gaslighting#involve-others" target="_blank">get space from the situation</a> and speak to others about what is happening – if possible, <a href="https://www.health.com/relationships/how-to-deal-with-gaslighter" target="_blank">cut the person out</a> of your life. Singer and Kenny recommend reaching out to a professional mental health specialist for help with next steps. If you can’t afford to do this privately, there are lots of charities and services that can help you out. In the UK, there are charities like <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/" target="_blank">Refuge</a>, <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/" target="_blank">Women’s Aid</a>, <a href="https://mensadviceline.org.uk/" target="_blank">Men’s Advice Line</a> and <a href="https://galop.org.uk/news/" target="_blank">Galop</a>, while the US has the <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/resources/what-is-gaslighting/#:~:text=If%20any%20of%20these%20signs,support%20and%20listen%20to%20you." target="_blank">National Domestic Violence Helpline</a>. Support is out there if you need it and with a little help, you’ll be back to being the loudmouthed, confident gobshite you’ve always been.</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> &amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>

<p>It seems as if our daily lives continue to get increasingly busy, from both a professional and personal perspective. Whether it’s remembering to email an important client or buying a gift for your child’s birthday, there is always something looming – a task that needs to be done. Like many others, I used to think I could just keep tasks in my head and remember everything that I needed to do. A few years ago, I started using task management apps to help structure everything I needed to get done. They have become essential tools that I use to run my everyday life. </p>



<p>I wanted to highlight three applications that have stood out to me as useful and effective, each with its own secret sauce: <a href="https://www.taskade.com/?via=fern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taskade</a>, <a href="https://ambassadors.any.do/?fpr=fern93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Any.Do</a>, and <a href="https://try.sunsama.com/fern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunsama</a>. Let’s take a closer look at each of these apps and what makes them so great.</p>



<h2 id="h-before-we-get-started">Before we get started</h2>



<p>I am an active user of all three of these platforms, and I think they are all great in their own way. The goal is to show you each of them and see if they fit into your daily life. At the end of the day, use the app or service that works best for you and helps you accomplish your goals.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-taskade"><a href="https://www.taskade.com/?via=fern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1. Taskade</a></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.taskade.com/?via=fern">Taskade</a> has been the longest-tenured task management app that I have used. <a href="https://www.taskade.com/?via=fern">I</a>t is a powerful and flexible task management app that allows users to create and manage tasks, notes, and projects with ease. One of the key features of Taskade is its ability to create hierarchies of tasks and subtasks, which makes it easy to break down larger projects into smaller, more manageable steps. That is where the name came from, the idea of cascading lists with different levels of importance. The app also supports collaboration, making it an excellent choice for teams and groups. Taskade is an extremely robust app with many features that can help with simple to-do lists or a larger project involving multiple people and moving parts. </p>

<p>Taskade’s interface is intuitive and customizable, allowing users to create a workspace that suits their needs and preferences. What drew me to this app was the use of workspaces to divide all of my tasks. I have a workspace for YouTube work that only I can see, another for shared work with colleagues, and then a personal one as well. Once you break down into these workspaces, there are also multiple ways to view your task. Their mind map feature might be my personal favorite. </p>

<p>The app also supports integrations, including Google Drive, Slack, and Trello, which makes it easy to incorporate Taskade into your existing workflow. Overall, Taskade is a versatile and user-friendly task management app that is well suited for individuals and teams alike.</p>



<h3>Pricing and availability </h3>



<p>Taskade does have a few tiers when it comes to licensing costs. But what I love about it is that if you are just looking for a personal task management tool, then the free version is more than enough. Taskade does not restrict features on the free version – they just restrict the quantity. I would recommend trying the free version for yourself to see if it’s something you want to integrate into your professional workflow! See pricing below:</p>

<p>This is the new kid on the block. I have been using <a href="https://ambassadors.any.do/?fpr=fern93">Any.Do</a> for a few months now, and three main things stood out to me. First was the UI. It’s easy to use, self-explanatory, no real tutorials needed to get started, and it’s pleasant to look at. Secondly is the dashboard. The dashboard provides a no-frills view of the tasks that need to get done. You simply log in, and the first thing you see is your To-Do’s. Then it gets broken down into projects into more specific project tasks. Lastly, the Scrum board feature works amazingly. Being able to create a project and then move it along a chronological timeline has been a lifesaver for my work. </p>

<h3 id="h-daily-view-my-lists-workspaces">Daily view, My Lists, &amp; Workspaces</h3>



<p>Similarly to <a href="https://www.taskade.com/?via=fern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taskade</a>, <a href="https://ambassadors.any.do/?fpr=fern93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Any.Do</a> breaks down your tasks into three main views: the dashboard view, the My lists view, and workspaces. All of these views work together to help accomplish your task. You start by creating list categories. You then start to put tasks in those lists. Once that is done, you can drag those tasks into your daily dashboard view to get them accomplished. Finally, you can elaborate on those tasks inside of the workspace view. The workspace view is the only view that is shareable with others, which is great in team settings. </p>



<p>Any.Do also includes a number of useful features, such as the ability to set reminders, add notes to tasks, and attach files to tasks. The app also integrates with a wide range of other productivity apps, including Google Calendar, Evernote, and Slack. Overall, Any.do has been an absolute pleasure to use due to its simplicity while also being extremely feature rich.</p>



<h3>Pricing and availability </h3>



<p><a href="https://ambassadors.any.do/?fpr=fern93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Any.Do</a> also takes a tiered approach to how they price their service. They do provide a<a href="https://ambassadors.any.do/?fpr=fern93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> free tier</a> that allows you to use everything besides workspaces. Again, I recommend trying the free version to see if it’s worth it to you to upgrade. They do provide a 14-day free trial for their highest tier, which will help show off some of the awesome features. The pricing is also very reasonable at $3/month for the Premium tier and $5/month for the Teams tier.</p>

<h2 id="h-3-sunsama">3. <a href="https://try.sunsama.com/fern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunsama</a></h2>



<p><a href="https://try.sunsama.com/fern">Sunsama</a> is the final task management app I wanted to mention. They take a unique approach to productivity. Rather than focusing solely on tasks and projects, Sunsama is designed to help users plan and prioritize their time more effectively. The app encourages users to think about their goals and objectives, and then helps them create a daily schedule aligned with those goals. The idea is that it’s OK to let tasks bleed into the following day instead of losing sleep trying to finish everything at once.</p>

<h3>The Sunsama daily routine</h3>



<p>Every time you log into your <a href="https://try.sunsama.com/fern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunsama</a> dashboard for the first time, it takes you through a daily exercise. It lets you know what you accomplished yesterday and what you plan to accomplish today, and it helps you prioritize your tasks. The idea is similar to waking up and writing down what you are grateful for – Sunsama wants to start your day in a positive light by showing you what you accomplished. We have an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/24/hands-on-sunsama-is-a-new-daily-planner-app-that-claims-its-not-a-productivity-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-depth article about Sunsama</a> if you want to dive in a bit more. </p>



<p>Sunsama lays out your tasks in a calendar view. It makes you write down each individual task and then drag them to the date that you wish to complete them. It also gives you the ability to integrate with other productivity apps, such as Asana, Trello, and Google Calendar. This allows users to easily import tasks and events from other apps into Sunsama and to see all of their tasks and events in one place. So if you have a 10:30 meeting in your Google Calendar, it will show up in your Sunsama view. </p>

<p>Sunsama’s interface is clean and simple, making it easy to use and navigate. You can separate tasks based on channels or tags and categorize these tasks easily; the UI makes it easy to get a full view of your priorities. Overall, Sunsama is an innovative and effective tool for anyone looking to improve their productivity and time management skills.</p>



<h2>Pricing and availability </h2>



<p>Sunsama is the one platform that is a paid service. They do provide a <a href="https://try.sunsama.com/fern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30-day trial by clicking here</a> to let you play with the entire app. There is no feature cap to the free trial. One interesting thing is that they let you restart your free trial after 30 days, but they start you from scratch. So they remove all of your existing tasks and calendars. After the trial, it’s $16/month to use them – well worth it, in my opinion!</p>

<h2 id="h-wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>



<p>As I mentioned in the intro, I recommend using what is best for you! If the Apple notes app gets the job done, then stick to it! But if you are looking for something extra that provides a bit more functionality, then giving one of these a try is well worth it. They each have either a free tier or a free trial, so there is no harm in trying them.</p>



<p>They all have a corresponding iOS app as well. I will say that <a href="https://ambassadors.any.do/?fpr=fern93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Any.Do</a> has the best iOS app because it has most of the features of the macOS version; the iOS apps for Sunsama and Taskade are a bit more of a watered-down version of the desktop apps. </p>



<p>What do you think? Which of these apps or services are you more willing to try and why? What is a task management app that you use that was not mentioned? Let’s discuss this in the comments!</p>
