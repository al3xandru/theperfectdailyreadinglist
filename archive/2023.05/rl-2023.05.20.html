<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> &#34;If I formally verify my code, I don&#39;t need to test it!&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Researchers looked at three formally verified systems, and found critical correctness bugs in all three. The bugs were from &#34;a wide range of mismatched assumptions&#34; and caused servers to crash or produce wrong data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Most bugs were at the system boundaries; none were found in the implemented protocols. Formally verified systems, while not perfect, were considerably less buggy than unverified systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong>  Systems were verified with Coq and Z3. Further discussion at <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/05/29/an-empirical-study-on-the-correctness-of-formally-verified-distributed-systems/" rel="nofollow">The Morning Paper</a>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> &#34;Identifiers should be self-documenting! Use full names, not abbreviations.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Researchers had programmers fix bugs in a codebase, either with all of the identifiers were abbreviated, or where all of the identifiers were full-words. They found no difference in time taken or quality of debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Only applies to fixing bugs. Otherwise watertight. This is honestly one of the most rigorous and comprehensive papers I&#39;ve ever read.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong> Includes ethnography on how programmers debug abbreviated code. Link is to the author preprint.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> camelCase is easier to read than under_score. So it is a best practice to
use camelCase in variable names, function names, and other identifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Several research papers have been done. But when eye-tracking software was
used to test the claim, two conclusions emerged: (1) developers are equally accurate
regardless of style, but (2) the under_score style can be processed faster and easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> The study&#39;s sample size was small (15 people), and &#34;Subjects were
historically trained mostly in the underscore identifier style and were all programmers.&#34;
In the study, subjects were presented terms in isolation (not in blocks of code). Thus,
as the study notes, there could be variance due to context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong> &#34;The interaction of Experience with Style indicates that novices benefit
twice as much with respect to time, with the underscore style.
&#34;This paper purports to remedy difficulties in an earlier paper entitled
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=BD104CB69764CBBB36249528028E19B7?doi=10.1.1.158.9499&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow">To CamelCase or Under_score</a>,
which concluded that with training, camelCase is more accurately processed. Finally, neither
paper seems to have analyzed whether native language comes into play (e.g. whether it is
easier for non-native English speakers to understand camelCase versus under_score).</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> &#34;Microservices! Microservices!&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Presents five fallacies of &#34;why microservices solve problems monoliths have&#34; and shows how either monoliths don&#39;t actually have those problems or that microservices make the problem even worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Abstract arguments and experience, no case studies or examples.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00602" rel="nofollow">VM Warmup Blows Hot and Cold</a></h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype</strong>: Your favourite programming language has been updated. The new
version makes impressive performance improvement claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower</strong>: Benchmarking modern programming languages under near-ideal
circumstances, just for longer than before, suggests that we have not been
benchmarking language implementations as accurately as we might wish. Many
benchmarks slow down over time. Some never stabilise. Many benchmarking
experiments will not be repeatable due to non-determinism. Warmup time is
important, but is usually either ignored, or reported inaccurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats</strong>: Only evaluates the x86_64 architecture, and for only two
operating systems (Linux and OpenBSD). Experiment conducted in 2017 (prior to
meltdown patching). Evaluates mainly JITted language implementations
(although C benchmarks were included).</p>
</li>
<li>

open source license. <a href="https://github.com/softdevteam/warmup_experiment">Start here</a>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> &#34;Scaling out is better than scaling up. Cloud is more scalable than bare metal.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Expensify found that running a single bare-metal server was both faster and cheaper than using a x1e.32xlarge EC2 instance. By using one server, they could avoid sharding their data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Does not cover if scaling out bare metal has the same advantages over scaling out EC2 (assuming you can afford sharding). Can&#39;t really compare how much cheaper the bare metal is because they don&#39;t list the cost. I&#39;m guessing their servers are 100k each? No basis for that guess though.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://songlh.github.io/paper/go-study.pdf" rel="nofollow">Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go (PDF)</a></h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> Compared to other languages, Go&#39;s concurrency system of goroutines and channels is easier to understand, easier to use, and is less prone to bugs and memory leaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> According to an empirical study by Tu, <em>et al</em>, there are plenty of concurrency-related bugs related to the difficulty in understanding and following the concurrency features and patterns provided by Go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> This study is specific to Go. Though other languages provide similar facilities, they are not covered in this article. Also, the types of bugs seen with channels and shared memory are different. Channels lead to more blocking bugs (deadlocks, dangling channels) while shared-memory lead to more nonblocking bugs (race conditions, dirty reads).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong> &#34;We studied six popular Go software including Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC. We analyzed 171 concurrency bugs in total, with more than half of them caused by non-traditional, Go-specific problems&#34;</p>

If these guys succeed in bringing self-attention&#39;s computational cost down from O(n²) to O(n log n), that would be a huge win. The quadratic cost makes it very difficult to increase sequence length on current hardware. I&#39;m going to take a closer look.<p>There are other interesting ongoing efforts to increase sequence length. One that has worked for me is this dynamic routing algorithm, related to self-attention, that can handle sequences with 1M+ tokens in a single GPU: <a href="https://github.com/glassroom/heinsen_routing">https://github.com/glassroom/heinsen_routing</a> . Right now, you can take 1,000 sequences of hidden states computed by a pretrained transformer, each sequence with, say, 1024 tokens, concatenate them into a single ultra-long sequence with 1,024,000 hidden states, slap 1,024,000 position encodings on top, and feed the whole thing to that routing algorithm to predict the next token (or whatever other training objective you want to optimize for). It works. Search the README for &#34;Very Long Sequences&#34;.</p><p>If anyone here has other suggestions for working with long sequences (hundreds of thousands to millions of tokens), <i>I&#39;d love to learn about them</i>.

In the case of attention, that means modeling n×n, or n², pairwise relationships. In the case of that dynamic routing method, it means modeling n×m pairwise relationships, where n and m are the number of tokens in the input and output sequences. I suspect that the key reason why that routing method works for long sentences is because m can be <i>much smaller</i> than n: Routing 1M tokens to 100 tokens requires ~10,000x less compute than applying attention over 1M tokens for each of 1M tokens.</p><p>If the work described by the OP succeeds in bringing computational cost down from O(n²) to O(n log n) <i>while still explicitly modeling (approximating) all n² pairwise relationships</i>, that would be a huge win.

It&#39;s become my go-to solution whenever I need to combine data, hidden states, or model outputs of different sizes/dimensions/modalities into something that works on the first try. It can &#34;glue models together into systems&#34; without much hassle. I mean, you still have to tinker and tweak to get things to work <i>well</i>, but no more than usual.</p><p>Most recently, I&#39;ve been using it to build models with access to long-term memory, more or less like this: Concatenate a large number of sequences of previously computed transformer hidden states. Apply a couple of routing layers to shrink them into a single short sequence of fixed size. Attach the shrunk sequence as a form of long-term memory to the <i>current</i> sequence of final transformer hidden states. Slap a couple of routing layers on top to predict things of interest. Finally, train only the routing layers (leave all the transformer stuff frozen). You can of course save the long sequences of previous transformer hidden states in a key-value store and fetch them as needed :-)

You&#39;d have to train the model one time-step at a time, vs. all time-steps in parallel with a masked autoregressive transformer.<p>If you&#39;re looking to make context longer, a more practical approach is to route multiple past sequences of frozen pretrained transformer hidden states to a much shorter sequence, say, of length C, concatenate that with the current final sequence of hidden states, say, of length N, apply masked autoregressive attention on the C+N hidden states and then a feedforward layer to predict all next tokens in parallel, and last, drop the first C predictions, i.e., use only the trailing N predicted next tokens for training and inference.

If they could show AI reaching X threshold first, they could capture the market.  The fastest way to do that is to be training-compute optimal.  So they had to scale to 175B parameters or more.  Now that it&#39;s proven, and that there&#39;s a market for such an AI, their and other&#39;s focus can be on inference-optimal models which are smaller but just as smart.

It can be speed, it can be ability to retain a lot of information, it can be the ability to deal with a large quantity of information at once and many other dimensions besides. For the longest time Chess was considered a domain where computers could be dilettantes but could never dominate. Chess is now in &#39;superhuman&#39; territory and likely we will never see a reversal because any insight that benefits humans also benefits computers but not the other way around.<p>The fact that this is such a multi-dimensional problem is frequently overlooked in the debate about AI/AGI etc, it may not matter all that much if the non AGI AI is already superhuman on enough dimensions other than the ones that the &#39;but it isn&#39;t AGI&#39; crowd cling to. The consequences are what matters, <i>not</i> the fine print or the implementation details, and those consequences are directly tied to the number of dimensions along which a computer can beat humanity.</p><p>To give an example: if a chess program was 3000 Elo before but so slow that it would lose under competition rules then humans still dominated chess. Likewise if it would be only 2500 Elo but fast enough, it would still lose from the best humans. But for a large fraction of society it would have already moved out into &#39;superhuman&#39; territory. And a couple of technological leaps of progress later and we&#39;re <i>all</i> looking at that AI as if it has moved into superhuman regions.</p><p>This sort of thing will happen on many fronts, and all of those fronts are moving, if enough of them go past the threshold then whether it is AGI or not is irrelevant and for every person that threshold is at different points. Maybe a computer will be able to calculate faster and better than you can, maybe it will be able to translate text faster and better than you, maybe it will be able to organize information faster and better than you. At which point we cross the line into saying that it can <i>think</i> faster and better than you is hard, but we can see that we are getting close to that line without even knowing exactly where that line is.

Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss...&#34;</i>

What is missing is action — an interactive feedback loop between agent and environment. Progress in RL and robotics has been very slow by comparison and unless we see a breakthrough there, I would guess the GPT phase plateaus in the next 5-10 years.
