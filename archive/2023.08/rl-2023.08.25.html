        <p>I would describe myself as a PKM enthusiast. But I’m also a PKM <em>application</em> enthusiast and this means that I often have found myself falling down a rabbit hole lined with new shiny things. This has proven to be the downfall of my ability to process my notes and put them to good use. As someone who is often brimming with ideas and always consuming content, from either on or offline sources I’m caught in this spiral of collecting notes, and sometimes it feels like collecting for the sake of collecting.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493836512294-502baa1986e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGFueGlldHl8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgzMjQ2NDM4&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Shot made while filming for yesHEis project" loading="lazy" width="5004" height="3264" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493836512294-502baa1986e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGFueGlldHl8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgzMjQ2NDM4&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493836512294-502baa1986e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGFueGlldHl8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgzMjQ2NDM4&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493836512294-502baa1986e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGFueGlldHl8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgzMjQ2NDM4&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493836512294-502baa1986e2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGFueGlldHl8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgzMjQ2NDM4&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/de/@tjump?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Nik Shuliahin 💛💙</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I was giving this some thought. I came to realise that there is a fear, or should I say, a lack of <em>confidence</em>, in my own system. I’m often so concerned, what if it’s not efficient enough? Am I making sure it’s ‘future proof’? Do I like the aesthetic? Are the plugins enough for my needs? But what if my needs change? Oh that looks nice. Oh a new app, let’s start again.</p><p>It’s exhausting.</p><p>In my years of application-flipping, I have come to understand a simple truth; <strong>the perfect note taking application does not exist</strong>. It would be nice if it did, but it doesn’t. There is a lot of love for Obsidian out there, but I hate the way it works on mobile, I also don’t like that it can feel overwhelming as the notes mount up and the folder and document structure that I apply can get confused, cluttered and is ultimately, useless. For many it seems to be an all in one solution, but for me, it’s just too much in one place. Roam Research was the go to app for connected notes when it launched and was (and still is) an amazing outliner. What I love about outliners is that it doesn’t need a structure - you can easily take notes in a stream of consciousness. But the graph was frankly a disgrace. Obsidian solved that issue. Then Loqseq came along; great outliner and decent looking map. But it was buggy as hell in the beginning. Though it is in active development and I am financially supporting its development as I like where this is going, but for now, it’s benched. But don’t get my wrong: I love the idea of an outliner and it’s simplicity.</p><h2 id="less-options-more-work">less options, more work</h2><p>The issue with Obsidian that I have is that its got <strong>too many options</strong> I know that this sounds like I’m complaining over nothing and I probably am. However, as a chronic procrastinator I spend more time tinkering and less time actually processing the very growing library of notes into something that I may find useful someday. I think the trick with Obsidian is the initial set up. Which can take a very long time if you intend to use it as an all-in-one. I’ve seen many different YouTuber set up Obsidian for this purpose and as I have tried to shoehorn in different workflows into the single application I have found that certain things don’t work terribly well - for me it’s not a great project manager and data view, which I have attempted to get my head round feels like I’m stuck in the back end trying to get something to work as I need it to and my growing frustration in attempting to understand it means that once again, I’m neck deep in tutorials to find it’s not doing what I ask it to do. Then you need another plug in and another and another.</p><p>Then it came to me…</p><h2 id="start-at-the-end-and-work-backwards">start at the end and work backwards</h2><p>I think that when developing a note-taking and PKM (second brain) system it’s not uncommon for those who are embarking on this journey to start by looking at the different apps, they may read ‘<a href="https://amzn.to/415jINl?ref=notentirelyboring.com">How to take smart notes</a>’ or ‘<a href="https://amzn.to/3VvZo6J?ref=notentirelyboring.com">build and second brain</a>’ and then try to emulate these systems and shoehorn into these systems their own workflows. Only finding that the workflow doesn’t quite fit and we end up back at square one. As I previously mentioned, I know I have.</p><p>So I have decided that the most efficient way to develop a note taking system isn’t to start at the beginning, but to start at the end. What this means, is simply to think about what the notes are going to be used for.</p><p>This is when I started to take control of my system, rather than the system controlling me. In this case, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabUf74LsSUHZs50MSkKNcA?ref=notentirelyboring.com">I create travel YouTube videos</a> and I write blogs/essays and a newsletter. So with this in mind, it was clear that my end goal needed two different systems.</p><h3 id="youtube-content-creation">youtube content creation</h3><p>For YouTube videos, I plan a lot before we even start to film. Everything you see is (for the most part) structured along with a filming schedule. The reason for this is that I’m not fond of running around with a camera and hoping that something might come together in the edit. I need to be more focused on what we are capturing, so the limited time I have in each location is used efficiently. Ultimately this works, because YouTube isn’t monetised and it’s a hobby - I get to make travel videos and I also get to have a vacation. Winner, winner.</p><p>All the YouTube content planning started life in <strong>Notion</strong>. I am not a huge fan of Notion, windows upon windows upon windows - however as a database solution, it’s near perfect.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notentirelyboring.com/content/images/2023/05/AdobeStock_487022372_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.notentirelyboring.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/AdobeStock_487022372_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg 600w, https://www.notentirelyboring.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/AdobeStock_487022372_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg 1000w, https://www.notentirelyboring.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/AdobeStock_487022372_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg 1600w, https://www.notentirelyboring.com/content/images/size/w2400/2023/05/AdobeStock_487022372_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Credit: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><p>But this is where my stupid brain doesn’t quite do what it is supposed to. Let me explain:</p><p>When I plan anything, from YouTube videos to things that I want to write about - including the piece that you’re reading right now - I often find myself dancing around with different ideas. If I’m totally honest, as I’m writing this, I’m also thinking about the review I’ll be writing on The Cosmopolitan, which I have started writing. Along with pieces on both the History of VHS, and also underwater internet cables (hopefully if you’re subscribed to this page, you’ll find it not entirely boring!) Staying focused on one idea when there are multiple floating around is a challenge all of its own. I am currently reading the book ‘<a href="https://amzn.to/3p96Kky?ref=notentirelyboring.com">How to Calm Your Mind - finding Peace and Productivity in Anxious Times</a>’ by Chris Bailey (The author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3p96Kky?ref=notentirelyboring.com">The Productivity Project</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3AVHTTP?ref=notentirelyboring.com">Hyperfocus</a> - both incredible books that I would highly recommend) and I hope I can develop a strategy that will help with this issue. But that’s a story for another day.</p><p>To bring this back to note-taking and organisation I have found that project managing these workflows is different from my ‘second brain’ so it doesn’t need Obsidian. The additional note pages for YouTube end up cluttering my graph and it gets messy and overwhelming. So recently I dived into <strong>Tana</strong>.</p><h3 id="tana">Tana</h3><p>I am a bit late to the Tana party, but after I secured an early access invite a week ago, I’ve moved my YouTube organisation as well as my writing organisation from Notion to Tana. And it seems to work a treat. Supertags are a thing that I really didn’t think I would need and now I couldn’t imagine an outliner without them. The different views (such as Table) are great and allows we to see what’s been filmed, what’s the next task and also for my writing I can easily see what I’ve got in draft etc.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notentirelyboring.com/content/images/2023/05/DraggedImage.png" alt="" loading="lazy"/></figure><p>But more so, with the daily just like with roam and Logseq I can just dump in ideas and thoughts, and use the supertags and voila! That idea has been added to the table for that particular project category. Right now I’m very much a noob in my Tana journey, but I will keep you updated with my progress. I am working my way though many tutorials on YouTube so I can get the most out of it. (I’m also genuinely thinking about using it for my day-job).</p><h3 id="zettelkasten">zettelkasten</h3><p>I have been building a zettelkasten for a couple of years now, and it’s a complete mess of notes that are incomplete, half-baked ideas. I’ve lost count of the stuff I’ve imported from Readwise. I went though a phase of not deleting fleeting notes and also the novel I am writing requires a lot of political research that I’m dipping in and out of. So I was keeping that in the projects folder. These notes currently live in Obsidian and I think that’s the best place for them. If I take away all the plugins and add ons with Obsidian and keep it as light as possible, the slip box feels much less messy. I have been seriously considering moving my research into a different app, or vault to keep it segregated from the slip box and I am still on the fence. I think this will help me to focus better. But for now it’s all in Obsidian.</p><h2 id="long-form-writing">long form writing</h2><p>For blogging and essays, along with the Not Entirely Boring Newsletter, I have danced around different apps for Long-form writing for a while now. I did have it in Obsidian using the Long-form plugin, however with the overwhelming cluster of notes from my zettelkasten along with my ongoing obsession with that ‘appearance’ tab in the settings I found that I spend too much time procrastinating and not actually ‘writing’. So I decided that to have an application dedicated to long form writing would be best. For this, I chose Ulysses. This is primarily because of the clean, minimalist appearance. I love how it syncs to my iPhone with no issues whatsoever. I have found myself often doing some drafting on my iPhone when I’ve got some time, or as I’m writing this on vacation, I’ve written a fair chunk of this whilst laying by the pool. In addition, Ulysses also has incredible export options, particularly when it comes to exporting to Ghost. My chosen platform for my blog and newsletter. I am also using this for my writing book and after dancing with Scrivener and old faithful, MS Word - I do think that with Ulysses, I think I’ve found the perfect long form writing application. Just wish I could buy it, and not have to subscribe to use it fully.</p><h2 id="capturing-ideas">capturing ideas</h2><p>When it comes to capturing ideas on the fly, currently my weapon of choice is Drafts. Drafts is a fantastic note taking application that, with the right settings will always has a clean note ready to go when you open it. I’m very much the sort of person who doesn’t want to tap more than once when I go to write a new note. It syncs perfectly across the apple ecosystem and the stuff I write in Drafts is then processed into Obsidian or Tana depending if it’s an idea for a piece of content or something completely random. This seems to have solved my problem of fleeting notes which were building up in Obsidian adding to the complete mess that my zettelkasten was becoming.</p><h2 id="readwise">readwise</h2><p>If I’m Batman (I wish), then Readwise is Robin. Readwise Reader has replaced Instapaper has my ‘read later’ application of choice (and also that one less subscription to worry about) and though there are a few things that annoy me about it - for example if I want to save an article from Apple News+ that doesn’t seem to work, I get an extract and a link, so it’s not capable to make and save highlights. I know that Instapaper could do this, if I remember correctly so I do hope it’s a feature the team at Readwise can implement in the near future.</p><h2 id="the-tldrmy-current-workflow">the tldr - my (current) workflow</h2><ol><li>Capture - Drafts</li><li>Literature notes and imports from Readwise - Obsidian</li><li>Permanent and processed- Obsidian</li><li>Project Management and Planning - Tana</li><li>Using the notes / Long-form writing - Ulysses</li></ol><p>Thank you for reading to the end.

<p><em>Maurice Mitchell talks with Cyndi Suarez of Nonprofit Quarterly about the inspiration behind​ the article. </em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Executives in professional social justice institutions, grassroots activists in local movements, and fiery young radicals on protest lines are all advancing urgent concerns about the internal workings of progressive spaces. The themes arising are surprisingly consistent. Many claim that our spaces are “toxic” or “problematic,” often sharing compelling and troubling personal anecdotes as evidence of this. People in leadership are finding their roles untenable, claiming it is “impossible” to execute campaigns or saying they are in organizations that are “stuck.” </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">A growing group of new organizers and activists are becoming cynical or dropping out altogether. Most read their experiences as interpersonal conflict gone awry, the exceptional dynamics of a broken environment or a movement that&#39;s lost its way. A “bad supervisor,” a “toxic workplace,” a “messy movement space,” or a “problematic person with privilege” are just some of the refrains echoed from all corners of our movements. Individuals are pointing fingers at other individuals; battle lines are being drawn. Identity and position are misused to create a doom loop that can lead to unnecessary ruptures of our political vehicles and the shuttering of vital movement spaces. </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Movements on the Left are driven by the same political and social contradictions we strive to overcome. We fight against racism, classism, and sexism yet battle inequity and oppression inside our movements. Although we struggle for freedom and democracy, we also suffer from tendencies toward abuse and domination. We promote leadership and courage by individuals, but media exposure, social media fame, and access to resources compromise activists. We draw from the courage of radical traditions but often lack the strategy or conviction to challenge the status quo. The radical demands that we do make are so regularly disregarded that it can feel as if we are shouting into the wind. Many of us are working harder than ever but feeling that we have less power and impact. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">There are things we can and must do to shift movements for justice toward a powerful posture of joy and victory. Such a metamorphosis is not inevitable, but it is essential. This essay describes the problems our movements face, identifies underlying causes, analyzes symptoms of the core problems, and proposes some concrete solutions to reset our course.</span></p>

<h4 dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Roots of the Crisis</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">This moment is one of multiple, overlapping crises: a global pandemic, rising authoritarianism, climate emergency, political violence, unprecedented economic inequality, and general precarity all exacerbate interpersonal tension points. Like the rest of society, our movements exist within a general climate of anxiety, despair, and anger without the necessary support to process such massive emotions, individually or in community. Recognizing the challenging terrain on which we struggle and grow can allow for more compassion for our comrades as well as clarity about the urgent mandate at hand.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Our current movement is ideologically underdeveloped and uneven. History can help us understand why. There has been a one-sided, often government-initiated effort to defang movements for justice: the brutal terrorism following Reconstruction, the Red Scare following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, the dismantling of Pan-African nationalist movements in the 1920s, McCarthyism in the ’50s, COINTELPRO in the ’60s, and the war on militant Black liberation organizations well into the early ’80s. Leaders have been jailed, killed, or co-opted; organizations have been invaded, dismantled, or neutralized. We have inherited this traumatic and often bloody legacy. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">As a result of this rupture, over the past 50 years, many of our leaders have prioritized hard skills and pragmatism over developing their ideological orientation or running transformative campaigns.

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Using one’s identity or personal experience as a justification for a political position. You may hear someone argue, “As a working-class, first-generation American, Southern woman…I say we have to vote no.” What’s implied is that one&#39;s identity is a comprehensive validator of one’s political strategy—that identity is evidence of some intrinsic ideological or strategic legitimacy. Marginalized identity is deployed as a conveyor of a strategic truth that must simply be accepted. Likewise, historically privileged identities are essentialized, flattened, and frequently—for better or worse— dismissed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Fallacies</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">To be clear, personal identity and individual experience are important. And while it is true that the “personal is political,” the personal cannot trump strategy nor should it overwhelm the collective interest. Identity is too broad a container to predict one’s politics or the validity of a particular position. There are </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html">over 40 million</a> Black folk in the US. Some have great politics, some do not. One’s racial or gender identity, sex, or membership in any marginalized community is, in and of itself, insufficient information to position someone in leadership or mandate that their perspective be adopted.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">People with marginal identities, as human beings, suffer all the frailties, inconsistencies, and failings of any other human. Genuflecting to individuals solely based on their socialized identities or personal stories deprives them of the conditions that sharpen arguments, develop skills, and win debates. We infantilize members of historically marginalized or oppressed groups by seeking to placate or pander instead of being in a right relationship, which requires struggle, debate, disagreement, and hard work. This type of false solidarity is a form of charity that weakens the individual and the collective. Finding authentic alignment and solidarity among diverse voices is serious labor. After all, “steel sharpens steel.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Neoliberal identity politics strips from identity politics a focus on collective power or a political project and demand. What’s left is a narrow tool used as a personal cudgel or, as Barbara Smith </span><a href="http://www.blackfreedomstudies.org/events/spring-2021/black-and-red-black-liberation-and-socialism">has said</a>, “It’s like they’ve taken the identity and left the politics on the floor.” It should be noted that we have already seen this tactic used against us <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18489466">on the Left</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/us/politics/herschel-walker-raphael-warnock-race-georgia.html">the Right</a> in the fight for racial and economic justice. Identity in this context reaffirms the individualistic principles of neoliberalism instead of challenging them.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Maximalist arguments may present themselves as debates around principles, tactics, and language or as the performance of solidarity with individuals, identity groups, and other movements. Maximalism demands that allies embrace certain tactics or positions as a test of alignment. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Fallacies</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Maximalism ignores the fact that the value of any tactic  — or the appropriateness of any demand — must be evaluated within a larger strategy grounded in a power analysis. Sometimes tactics and demands help build power and sometimes they don’t. Taken alone, they are not an adequate tool to test for alignment. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">The simple reason is that there are not enough people who are already 100% aligned. Our organizations and movements need to </span>grow. Holding on to tactics and overly idealistic demands that keep us small but pure ignores the basic strategic imperative of building power. We should of course be skeptical of those who demand too little and tell our movements to set their sights too low. But we should not mistake putting forward anything less than our most ambitious aspirations for an act of cowardice. In fact, it might reflect a sober assessment of our own power or advance a longer term strategy. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Maximalist thinking is particularly pernicious when it is used to justify not doing the basic work of organizing: talking to lots of different kinds of people on the doors, in their homes, and in their workplaces. We need to meet people where they are, build relationships, and move them into action. The work of organizing and base building also disciplines our tactics by grounding them in the needs and demands of our people.</span></p>
<div dir="ltr"><p><span>Our opponents are formidable and dangerous. We must assess the power we actually have at all times and in every circumstance so that we don’t either leave power on the table or overreach and come up empty. Sometimes, our assessment will reveal the need for us to build tactical and strategic coalitions that share broad — though not identical — goals to fight our opponents. That requires us to sharpen our skills at debate and internal democracy so that we are in a position to lead a united front against rising authoritarianism. When we organize and win material change with and for our people, we expand our base and create more power. In this way, the demands we make tomorrow can be more ambitious than the ones we make today.</span></p></div>

Questioning the authority, legitimacy, and competence of those with positional, perceived, or other forms of power. Therefore, all decisions made by leadership are subject to broad-based skepticism and mistrust. Valuing expertise and experience is challenged as potentially elitist. Professionalization is cited as a problematic aspect of how leadership and power are meted out. Anti-intellectualism is promoted as an egalitarian appreciation of more informal forms of skill or knowledge. This is not to be confused with a healthy skepticism of authority and leadership, including within movement spaces.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Fallacies</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">To be clear, abuse of authority, corruption, and the arbitrary concentration of power are real problems that have gone unexamined in years past. We should credit those people—many of them newer and younger to the work—who are shining a light on systemic issues and the deep harm they cause to individuals and the power we seek. However, a reflexively anti-leadership orientation is an overcorrection that doesn’t make room for the existence of principled, responsive, accountable, and democratic leadership or for the ability of anyone in a leadership position to build strong movements, organizations, or workplaces.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Social change work requires experience, rigor, and study. It can take years of development to grow into a skillful organizer, strategist, communicator, campaign manager, or facilitator. Although talented people can rapidly develop skills, many capacities only develop over time. For example, judgment, relationship building, emotional maturity, and landscape awareness (including the knowledge of what you don’t know) deepen with experience.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“Professionalization” and experience are two different things that should not be conflated. Most organizers historically and globally have not been developed through professional pipelines. However, all skilled organizers—professional or otherwise—have rigorously honed those skills over time through study and practice.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Pretending formal leadership doesn’t exist can obscure hierarchies and create centers of informal power.

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Finally, there is a very real intellectual component to this work. The idea that working people do not or cannot engage in intellectual work is truly elitist and has not been my experience. </span></p>

Even institutions that begin as disruptors of the status quo can slow-walk toward conservatism, disconnection, bureaucracy, irrelevance, and inefficiency. In fact, given the system of capitalism our institutions are navigating, if we are not mindful of these realities, we risk falling into them. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Despite those common pitfalls, we need institutions for a powerful and durable movement. Organizations and institutions are political vehicles. They are also spaces where individuals develop skills, connection, and ideological alignment. Institutions transmit knowledge, hold strategy, and cultivate power. Atomized individuals that loosely assemble cannot do this at the scale needed to take on entrenched power.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Arguing for doing away with political vehicles without offering a viable replacement demonstrates a lack of a power analysis. The most organized forces can leverage crisis, so how can our movements win in moments of crisis if we relinquish our organized vehicles? When our opposition possesses disciplined and organized institutions at the ready to fill power vacuums, what does it mean to unilaterally disarm?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Instead, movement institutions should have a self-aware practice of mitigating the worst impulses of institutional drift while maximizing the strengths of people-focused infrastructure.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">For example, using the term “intersectionality” to, let&#39;s say, defend edits to a press statement.

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">It’s easier to use language and cultural references that signify an ideological inclination than to actually study and practice a particular framework. However, such loose ideological signaling can lead to incoherence. This practice can devolve legitimate frameworks, concepts, and language into tools for individuals to virtue signal or provide weight to an argument that does not stand on its own premises. It should be noted that it is popular to borrow catchphrases and quotes from Black feminists, theorists, thinkers, and collectives in particular. This is especially pernicious when the arguments those thinkers developed are hijacked and flattened by those seeking  personal benefit or legitimacy. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">The profligate and unexamined use of social media has amplified this particular trend. These platforms—owned and controlled by megacorporations—reward us for our ability to articulate or reshare the sharpest, pithiest, pettiest, most polemic, or most engaging “content.” There is no premium on nuance, accuracy, and context. There is little room for low-ego information sharing or curious and grounded political education. These platforms are ideal for, and give immediate reward to, uninformed cherry-picking, self-aggrandizement, competition, and conflict.</span></p>

In the worst cases, such practices weaken our work. At the same time, the instinct to reach for a high-minded theory when a simple request will do can overlook the power we have to set personal boundaries.

In nonprofits or social justice organizations, this often takes the shape of focusing on tensions playing out between junior staff and leadership. In social movements, it may show up as conflicts between movement formations, sectarian ideological groupings, or movement leaders.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">In prioritizing the small war, one accepts the notion that all sites of struggle are equal and that “making change wherever you are” includes addressing the demands placed on you as a functionary of a small nonprofit or a local activist in a community group. Refusal to wage the small war may therefore be seen as shirking a vital responsibility to maintain egalitarian power relations. </span>Because proximity becomes the most important factor in deciding where to take action, this thinking often lacks a structural and systemic analysis of oppression and can feed or be fed by disproportionality (or the inability to identify the scale of the problem, further defined below).

The small war ignores that crucial step and can therefore lead organizers to prioritize a relatively small internal quarrel over, say, a corporate campaign or structural power fight.

The onus is on the organization to deal with the harm, burnout, or psychological stress one may experience through the work. An organization or movement should prioritize addressing individuals’ feelings and healing any harm they encounter. Collective projects, campaigns, and efforts can and should be interrupted in service of this priority.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">Additionally, the scope of care a movement space, organization, or group is responsible for is sprawling—potentially addressing all or most personal triggers and traumas experienced in and outside the work.</span></p>

Organizations generally do not have the specialized skills to provide emotional or spiritual healing. Workplaces can provide a salary, benefits, paid time off, and other resources to help individuals access the support and care they require. Workplaces can also promote a culture of care and encourage individuals to care for themselves. Workplaces and colleagues cannot replace medical professionals, spiritual supports, or other devoted spaces of care.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-93af5700-7fff-f2fe-8f7b-8771299df407">This is also true for non-professional spaces. Your comrades can provide support, foster a caring environment, or help you out when you’re in distress. They cannot heal you or salve long-standing traumas. It is natural for us to turn to those closest when we’re in pain. It is an indictment of the larger systems in our society that abundant mental health and healing resources are not available to most of us.

Additionally, discomfort is part of the human condition and a prerequisite for learning. Violence and oppression are to be avoided but not discomfort.

At the same time, we cannot hold out for saviors in these roles. One leader or even a group of dynamic leaders cannot solve something that is very much “in the water” everywhere. It would be inconsistent for me to diagnose a problem as structural while pointing to solutions that can be executed only by a handful of individuals. We must adopt a more comprehensive understanding of leadership that recognizes that leaders and leadership exist at all levels of our organizations and movements. And importantly, the mass leadership of the working class -while unrealized- is a form of leadership with the potential to mitigate some of the tendencies outlined above, keeping our focus outward and on the main struggle. </span></p>

Organizing and contract negotiations can sharpen the skills of—and connections among—non-managerial staff as well as deepen management’s awareness of problems and the organization’s overall health. Collective bargaining agreements can increase clarity, promote equity, foster accountability, and provide a common language across an organization. And, most importantly, healthy labor/management relations can bridge gaps and serve as an ongoing resource for managers and unit members to tend to collective goals. No process, including unionization, can be a panacea to all our institutional woes. When done with enthusiastic, upfront support from managers and a bargaining unit committed to the organizational mission and vehicle, unionization can mitigate glass house/small war/anti-leadership tendencies rather than feed them.</span></p>

It does define and practice a form of leadership that moves us away from neoliberal individualism toward collective power and accountability.

In staffed organizations that are grassroots and community-based, this means ensuring that non-staff leadership is pronounced and real and staff leadership is accountable, clear, and experienced.

We must go through a humbling but necessary period of change to achieve it. We must learn how to synthesize lessons from the past and observations in the present.
