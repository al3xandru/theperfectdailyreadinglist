					<h2>Overview:</h2>
				<p>Freedom-loving libertarians who build communities under the assumption that natural resources are unlimited discover, to their dismay, that this isn&#39;t so.</p>
	</div>
	<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>In my <em><a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/atlas_shrugged.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlas Shrugged</a></em> series, I mentioned how Ayn Rand holds an attitude best described as “cornucopianism.” She treats every natural resource as inexhaustible. Nothing ever gets scarce or runs out, so nothing needs to be conserved.</p>



<p>When the narrative moves to Galt’s Gulch, a secret hideout for the world’s greatest capitalists, the paradox gets sharper. Their logging, mining and heavy industry <a href="https://onlysky.media/alee/atlas-shrugged-natural-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t create any pollution</a> or leave any mark on the beautiful natural landscape. What’s more, conveniences like roads and coffee and fresh fruit appear <a href="https://onlysky.media/alee/atlas-shrugged-the-lilies-of-the-field/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as if materializing from nowhere</a>, despite there being no obvious way to produce them.</p>



<p>Now—if you were of a libertarian bent yourself—you might object that this is a work of fiction, stripped down to the essentials to make a philosophical point. You might argue that libertarians know perfectly well that in the real world, natural resources aren’t infinite. You might say all of those things.</p>



<p>With that in mind, let’s talk about Rio Verde Foothills.</p>



<h2>Water, water everywhere… or not</h2>



<p>Rio Verde Foothills is an unincorporated rural community in the wilds of Maricopa County, Arizona. As you may know, Arizona is largely desert, and deserts are well-known for lacking abundant water.</p>



<p>Arizona law requires homebuilders in active management areas to secure a reliable source of water expected to last at least a hundred years. However, there’s a loophole: the law only applies to subdivisions of six homes or more. You can guess what some clever developers do: they simply build lots of “subdivisions” each consisting of only five homes.</p>



<p>These so-called “<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale/2023/01/19/arizona-community-without-water-what-to-know-about-rio-verde-foothills/69819245007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wildcat</a>” communities are all over the state. They’re miniature havens of freedom, perfect for stubbornly independent libertarians who want to get out from under the thumb of government bureaucrats telling them where they can and can’t live. Rio Verde Foothills is one such.</p>



<p>But then they made an awful discovery. It turns out, even when you find a way to skirt regulations about water… <em>humans still need water</em>.</p>



<p>Where have Rio Verde Foothills’ inhabitants been getting water to drink, wash and brush their teeth? They’ve been doing what libertarians usually do: they rely on other people who planned better than they did.</p>



<p>Specifically, for years, they’ve been getting water from the neighboring community of Scottsdale. They would drive tanker trucks into Scottsdale, fill up from the municipal supply, and haul the water back to Rio Verde Foothills to store it in tanks.</p>



<p>But Scottsdale grew tired of this. Since they themselves were under drought pressure, they took the understandable position that they should be conserving their water for their own residents, not to subsidize their neighbors who couldn’t be bothered to plan. Scottsdale repeatedly warned Rio Verde Foothills to make other arrangements, a warning they ignored. Then, at the beginning of 2023, <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/regional/scorched-earth/rio-verde-foothills-water-rural-arizona-law-valley/75-6ae2ef4d-7cd1-4a93-babb-9eea7a0634a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scottsdale cut them off</a>.</p>



<p>Since losing their water supply, Rio Verde Foothills residents have been complaining bitterly, protesting and petitioning. They even filed a lawsuit demanding that Scottsdale turn the tap back on. In the meantime, they’re relying on water trucked from farther away in the state, at great expense, with no assurance of future availability.</p>



<p>The obvious solution would be for Rio Verde Foothills to incorporate, form a water district, and find its own reliable supply… but it turns out that might involve <em>taxes</em>, so the whole proposal collapsed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/us/arizona-water-rio-verde-scottsdale.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m not making that up:</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>When some proposed forming their own self-funded water provider, other residents revolted, saying the idea would foist an expensive, freedom-stealing new arm of government on them. The idea collapsed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/latest-push-for-solutions-for-rio-verde-foothills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This quote</a> from a resident, George Rodriguez, sums up the head-in-the-sand attitude that prevails:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There are a lot of political undertones that we don’t understand; we don’t wanna understand that. We just want a solution,” says Rodriguez.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rio Verde Foothills is one of many communities in red Western states which are finding, to their dismay, that natural resources aren’t limitless. A town called Oakley, in Utah, had to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/us/utah-water-drought-climate-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">halt all new development</a> because of insufficient water. Its mayor said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I hate government infringement in people’s lives, but it’s like having kids: Every once in a while you got to crack down.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The same is happening in <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2021/06/09/fountain-colorado-springs-housing-low-water-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fountain, Colorado</a>; in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/08/15/st-george-utah-water-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">St. George, Utah</a>; and in <a href="https://www.myhighplains.com/water-and-drought-on-the-high-plains/the-ogallala-aquifer-when-will-the-wells-run-dry-what-then/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas</a>, where the Ogallala Aquifer is being drained dry.</p>



<p>These towns and farms in the desert were built according to cornucopian assumptions that there’d always be more water—no need to worry about where it comes from. When that proved not to be true, the freedom lovers who live there were flummoxed and dismayed.</p>



<h2>Learning the hard way</h2>



<p>In Ayn Rand novels and libertarian politics in general, the government is a bunch of parasitic bureaucrats and thugs who stop people from doing what they want for no good reason. If we got rid of them, we’d all be better off, with no downsides.</p>



<p>When libertarians try to put that lesson into practice, they often end up learning the hard way why government exists. It’s to solve the <a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/essays/carrot&amp;stick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prisoner’s Dilemma</a>: to restrain the choices that are selfishly advantageous but unsustainable if everyone does them.</p>



<p>Water is one example, but there are others. Another is Von Ormy, Texas, a rural community that chose to become a “<a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-freest-little-city-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liberty city</a>” to avoid being swallowed by San Antonio, becoming subject to its laws.</p>



<p>Businesses were supposed to flock to this oasis of freedom, drawn by low taxes and minimal regulation. Instead, because the town lacks a sewer system, it couldn’t attract investment—and anti-tax rules made it impossible to issue a municipal bond to pay for one. With no source of funding, the police department lost its accreditation, the fire department collapsed, and the city council has dissolved into acrimonious infighting.</p>



<p>Or take Grafton, New Hampshire. It’s a tiny town that was taken over by libertarians who moved there en masse to create their vision of heaven on earth. They voted themselves into power, slashed taxes and cut the town’s already minuscule budget to the bone. Journalist Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling recounts <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159662/libertarian-walks-into-bear-book-review-free-town-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what happened next</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Grafton was a poor town to begin with, but with tax revenue dropping even as its population expanded, things got steadily worse. Potholes multiplied, domestic disputes proliferated, violent crime spiked, and town workers started going without heat. “Despite several promising efforts,” Hongoltz-Hetling dryly notes, “a robust Randian private sector failed to emerge to replace public services.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then the town was taken over by bears.</p>



<p>That’s not the setup to a joke. Some people were disposing of food garbage carelessly, where the area’s native black bears could get at it. Others were <em>feeding them deliberately</em> (!). Either way, bears learned that humans meant food—and they became increasingly bold and aggressive in their attempts to get it. On top of all its other problems, Grafton found itself dealing with a rash of bear attacks, pet deaths and maulings.</p>



<h2>Solitude on a finite planet</h2>



<p>Libertarian ideology proposes that humans in a state of nature need never affect each other. Without laws or government, we can all revel in the freedom of solitude, making whatever choices we wish without having to care about anyone but ourselves.</p>



<p>The reality is, we need a society with rules because we all live together on the same finite planet. Like it or not, the choices you make affect others, and vice versa. That’s true whether you’re pumping your neighbors’ aquifer dry or attracting bears to their trash cans. The laws we have are a reflection of that interconnectedness, not the source of it.</p>



<p>In the best case, laws steer people away from perilous courses of action and into mutually beneficial ones. When you <em>remove</em> those laws, the result isn’t a better world. It’s a more chaotic and dangerous world, where people have more “freedom” to make bad choices that harm their neighbors. When you encounter an armchair reasoner who’s certain it would all work out, you can tell him that there’s real-world evidence to the contrary. Libertarianism is a failed experiment.</p>

And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for
them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being
ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must
be laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear
of punishment.</p><p>And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness
to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
dishonourable.</p><p>Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.</p><p>And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot help --not under the
idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task
of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.

The author argues that good people are not ambitious and do not care about honor, so they must be forced to serve out of fear of punishment. The worst punishment, according to the author, is the fear of being ruled by someone who is worse than oneself. This fear is what ultimately compels good people to take office, even though they do not want to and do not expect to benefit from it. The author suggests that good people take office out of a sense of necessity, because they are not able to entrust the task of ruling to anyone who is better than themselves.

No promotion because the system is fucked?  Sorry, you gotta say “better luck next time”. No raises because the company is being cheap? Sorry, gotta say “the cost of labor has not gone up even though inflation is through the roof”. Say what the company tells you, not what’s personally right.</p><p>- Certain kinds of politics where you have to screw over other teams or people in order for your team or reports to not get screwed over. Many companies are very dog eat dog.</p><p>- Layoffs and firing people.  It’s not as bad as getting laid off/fired but firing someone or trying to keep the rest of your team focused when a team member got laid off is not fun at all.</p><p>- Overall, managers almost never get credit when something goes well but are always blamed when something goes wrong. It’s a really thankless job.

The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.&#34;

No manager of a team doing technically complex and creative work can for very long remain capable of doing all the work themselves.   Modern projects and processes simply require too much specialized knowledge to function for that to work.   What managers need that (probably) comes from having been a strong individual contributor is sufficient knowledge of the fields involved in what they&#39;re managing to be able to understand the critical elements in the project or process in the context of the overall goal, and to be able to evaluate well the value of ideas for improvement or problem solution that come out of their team.   But they also need leadership and management skills.   The latter are not the same as, and are not developed by, stellar individual contributor skills.   Furthermore, it&#39;s important to understand that management and leadership are not the same thing.<p>My personal experience has been that I was a very able individual contributor, and that I was able to learn leadership skills (that is, how to inspire people; how to recognize their strengths and weaknesses and assign work that played to the former, and created opportunities to ameliorate the latter; how to point individuals and teams in fruitful directions without having (or often being able to) do all the hard work of pushing in that direction myself) by diligent study of people and myself.   But I was never able to become more than a barely competent manager - I always had, by design, an &#34;administrative partner&#34; on my team who brought those abilities to the table - and I always paid attention to what they had to say.   That combination (technical knowledge, leadership skills, and sub-contracted management skills) carried me from individual contributor to team lead, to product line lead, to CTO of highly successful $10B billion medical and technology organization in 20 years.

Key technical decisions are relegated to senior individual contributors, allowing for CV driven development, cargo culting, and bad habits.

to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot help --not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.
For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention
as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest,
but that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one.&#34;<p>Plato, <i>The Republic</i>

They aren&#39;t the kind of people who don&#39;t understand people and fall into the trap of simply controlling and micro-managing people.</p><p>Let me give you an example of the bad kind. Google&#39;s SWE ladder goes all the say from L3 (new grad) to L9 (ignoring exceptions like Google Fellow and execs). There is an expectation of growth from L3 to L5 (Senior SWE). There is a lot of reward if you can get promoted to L6 (Staff SWE) but it is incredibly difficult. It requires a lot of luck (eg being on the right project that doesn&#39;t get cancelled). Getting to L6 now is <i>much</i> harder than it was 10-15 years ago.</p><p>One of the things Ruth Porat did when she came in was to control costs by reducing the promotion target percentage because it wasn&#39;t visible to people (there was a leaked memo). All promo candidates go to committee and effectively get stack ranked across committees. There is a quota (&#34;target percentage&#34;) of who gets promoted. This creates a backlog and raises the bar for getting promoted. It gives more time for your impact to dissipate or your project to get cancelled (which was your promotion case).</p><p>Compare this to getting promoted as a manager. Your manager level (M0 to M2, which is the same level as L5 to L7) is effectively a function of your head count with the added requirement that M2 requires you to have managers as reports. So if you&#39;re an M0 (which is rare), getting to M1 is typically as easy as getting to 10-15 reports (as long as you don&#39;t screw up so badly).</p><p>So there is a breed of SWEs that bridge these worlds. They&#39;re half an IC and half an EM in the hopes that this gets them over the line.</p><p>In my experience, these managers were generally the absolute worst. They had no interest in ever being a amanager and were just ticking a box for an L6 promotion case. Career development tended to be zero. Everything was seen through the lens of what helped them get promoted. If that means throwing someone under the bus, so be it.</p><p>I think one of the best things Facebook did was they effectively didn&#39;t allow this. Having reports as an IC generally wasn&#39;t allowed. Being an L5 with reports was mostly not allowed. I mean there were some exceptions in some orgs and for some people but it was exceedingly rare. You&#39;d see people ask &#34;why can&#39;t I be a manager at L5?&#34; and you heavily suspected the main motivator for this question was an inability to get promoted to L6 as a SWE.

I know for a fact that he dislikes lots of meeting and really likes working on the core product, and so far hasn&#39;t really jumped on the opportunity to go into management - he doesn&#39;t <i>really</i> want to be manager.

This leads to a situation of people managers who care less about managing people than managing delivery and technology strategy. The best of those also have a lot of empathy and inadvertently are good at people management.<p>Another reason, often related in my experience, is a lot of companies careers plateau for ICs pretty early on. Your comp stops growing beyond COLA, titles exhaust, and despite being young you’re at a terminal career velocity. The only thing way to break up is to become management. This isn’t surprising - who controls promotion and comp other than managers, and why on earth wouldn’t they structure things to reward themselves and people like them?  There are many companies that have recognized this and created IC paths parallel to management, at least up to the C level. However the relative difficulty in achieving them is disproportionately weighted against the IC vs manager. At Amazon there’s a crap ton of VP and Director managers. But it’s absurdly hard to get senior principal or distinguished engineer. The rationale is they want to keep the prestige of the level high for IC. But that’s weird - the prestige of the same level in management must therefore be low and why is the bar different for the same level if you’re managing vs building?

I didn&#39;t want to be a leader. I don&#39;t want to tell people what to do. I don&#39;t want to give orders everyone else has to follow. I like the team approach. 
But people are conditioned to follow.
Except they aren&#39;t following... when you apply too much pressure.</p><p>I set up a website to plan raids. Paid for a domain. Went through the hassle to configure it and a discord server and a bridge between those and all I wanted was that people fucking sign up or off from raids.
I asked them when they&#39;re available and made a plan most people are comfortable with. 
Only 5 out of 30 people did even register on the site.
They joined the guild because it was advertised as a raid guild with social spots but raid being the main theme. A RAID GUILD.
After 2 months I was so stressed out that I simply abandoned the guild and left the game.</p><p>I can&#39;t do everything alone. When I said that I never felt so stressed out in all my life 2 people offered to help with leading raids but at that point it was too late. Some players joined from other guilds,  got spell upgrades for free, then left the guild. Some people joined from other guilds to cause drama and distress.</p><p>This is of course not real life. But it&#39;s close. You don&#39;t pay your members money for work and can&#39;t expect they follow guidelines. But holy crap, can you at least expect some interest in the main theme of the guild and them to sign up on the site and sign on and off of raids?</p><p>I never wanted to be leader. I feel well in the role of an advisor, someone who helps lead. But not the sole person responsible for everything. I&#39;m not perfect. No one is. I was overwhelmed because every piece of the hierarchy in the end asked me what to do. And if I postponed answering things would get worse.</p><p>In software development I can be agile and change things around, but people demand stability. They want a bed already made but are not willing to do the effort to build that bed.</p><p>In retrospect I should&#39;ve continued and &#34;fired&#34; 90% of the members even if that meant the end of independent raiding. But I was too stressed out and losing key people,  because that game was designed around key roles being present in a raid.
I didn&#39;t make the necessary decisions because I didn&#39;t want to lose anyone and not piss anyone of. But in the end key people left regardless. 
So lesson learned if you do something, focus on just doing that one thing and don&#39;t get ballast on board in the first place. It&#39;s better to have a small, dedicated group, seeing  eye to eye, than a large group where the majority doesn&#39;t care about success.</p><p>Anyhow, see I wasn&#39;t a good manager, despite me not wanting to be a manager.

But if you look at them most were just accidental and he only recognized them as success when they hit him in the face.</p><p>* Apple didn&#39;t &#34;invent&#34; the Mac, all of it&#39;s technologies were copied straight out of Xerox&#39;s Palo Alto research center. He found them in a demo.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t &#34;invent&#34; Pixar. George Lucas and Ed Catmull did it. His project was to create an hardware company (the only thing he knew to do) and to sell it. But Pixar &#34;accidentally&#34; found success creating animated intros for commercials and television shows and Jobs did nothing to discover this early market.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the iPhone. He was scared of dealing in an area where Apple didn&#39;t have expertise and tought it would be dangerous (a call to 911 failing because the phone could be stuck in a processing task). It took years of internal pressure by Apple engineers and management and a personal fiasco on a Nokia phone with iTunes for him to accept the iPhone.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the AppStore. For the first 6 months the iPhone didn&#39;t had an AppStore because he tought it would relinquish control of the platform to others. He only accepted it because in these first 6 months the iPhone sales were a disaster. He accepted the AppStore because the customers were screamming for it. It was the AppStore that saved the iPhone.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the Apple I, Wozniak did it. And the idea to turn the kit into a functional computer was not Jobs&#39;. It was a precondition imposed by a RadioShack manager.</p><p>* NEXT wasn&#39;t a commercial success. An expensive computer for college students with a black and white monitor was not selling enough to sustain the company. He was basically lucky that at the same time, Apple under Sculley, was a much bigger failure and the management board called him back.</p><p>&#34;Reality distortion field&#34; and &#34;stealing&#34; other people&#39;s ideas were Jobs&#39; greatest talents. But then, these are the talents of most cult founders from Jim Jones to Donald Trump.

Benefit of jumping ship from development to photography is that I don&#39;t have to rely on Squarespace like most other photographers!<p>After trying a few server-based options like Ghost, Statamic and self-built ones with Phoenix or Vapor (I&#39;ve covered some ground as a dev) and the usual SSG options I ended up just writing everything as straight HTML without any templates and upload to a Hetzner server using rsync.</p><p>The lack of templating for shared UI like navigation is a touch irritating, but with some RegEx magic I haven&#39;t found a change I want to make that takes more than a few minutes. I got caught out early on with some greedy RegEx that nuked some content, but git to the rescue.</p><p>Image generation with all the sizes and format variants is laborious, but it prompts me to try new layouts rather than relying on cookie-cutter ones like Ghost. Plus I&#39;ve noticed a slight improvement in image quality generating my web variants out of my RAW editor (Capture One) vs using the libraries and CLI tools used in most SSGs.</p><p>It&#39;s slower, but my thinking is that it&#39;s more akin to putting together a photo book. It take more effort up front, but once it&#39;s done, it&#39;s done for good, and won&#39;t need mangling in and out of various CMS over the next 20 years!

I prefer a server over services like Netlify because I can deploy with rsync rather than git (or the web-based UI). Plus it lets me log the many 404s I get after so many site migrations, and then create 301s. Most services like Cloudflare and Netlify just swallow details like that unless you pay for upgraded analytics.<p>I keep it as vanilla HTML though because I like the fact that I can open any page as a standalone file with no server and almost any browser can render it. I&#39;m not saying this won&#39;t change, but for now I&#39;m happy without SSI.</p><p>Plus, I&#39;m using Nova for some Panic-based nostalgia (Coda was big when I started), so I like having the code and rendered HTML side by side in Nova&#39;s preview.

You can have a relatively simple website if it doesn&#39;t <i>do</i> anything and if it cuts corners.<p>Take your dark mode, which is just about the only nontrivial feature I see on this page. (One could also criticize the low contrast of the appearance and other problems, but that&#39;s less relevant to the simplicity thesis you&#39;re claiming.)</p><p>First, your dark mode is implemented wrong in the lazy corner-cutting way of doing JS post-load instead of the correct way of CSS body classes; so you get the &#39;flash of white&#39; unavoidably on every page load - just what every dark mode user with their phone to their face at midnight wants to see! (If your solution doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s &#39;simple&#39; or &#39;complex&#39;.)</p><p>Second, you implement what is like 3 lines of JS (setting localstorage &amp; dark-mode) by pulling in what looks like an entire interpreter for a custom &#39;hyperscript&#39; <a href="https://hyperscript.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://hyperscript.org/</a> language which seems to mostly just offer some sugar over JS; now, maybe you use &#39;hyperscript&#39; elsewhere for reasonable purposes, but surely pulling in a 96kb (uncached) library solely to run</p><p>def saveMode() if first classList.value of &lt;html/&gt; contains &#39;dark&#39; set localStorage.kkColorMode to &#39;dark&#39; else  set localStorage.kkColorMode to &#39;light&#39; end end</p><pre><code>  init if localStorage.kkColorMode is empty set localStorage.kkColorMode to &#39;light&#39; end if localStorage.kkColorMode is &#39;dark&#39; add .dark to &lt;html/&gt; end
</code></pre>
is a bit against the spirit of this &#34;simplicity is the ultimate perfection&#34; enterprise...? Personally, I feel like I see some easy perfection to add right there. (And is this hyperscript stuff also why the HTML doesn&#39;t validate?)<p>Third, this binary toggle is a bad way to implement dark mode because it ignores system/browser settings, so if a user has, say, enabled dark-mode on their smartphone OS, they still get served light-mode until they manually enable it; note that some systems change it based on local time/ambient light too, which is quite nice... if websites &amp; apps respect it instead of overriding it. And since localstorage expires and users switch devices, they would have to do so repeatedly. Is this a good thing? A user probably would disagree with the developer who is touting how &#39;simple&#39; the dark-mode implementation is because they cut corners in handling system settings/auto-dark-mode...

Otherwise, you&#39;d just be sending 80-col ASCII textfiles down the wire (or something even simpler than that, like nothing at all).<p>Is dark-mode a good <i>requirement</i>? I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s nice to have, and our dark-mode does look great on a recent smartphone in the dark - but if I had known just how hard a good dark-mode would be, and how many of the issues we would struggle with (issues which OP runs headlong into), I think we would&#39;ve skipped it. There&#39;s a lot of other things that time &amp; energy could go into.</p><p>For most websites, I would say that they have far too many problems to spend time on dark-mode, no matter how trendy dark-mode is. (Users who really want dark-mode can install one of many extensions/plugins/apps/screen-inversion tools. They work reasonably well, and usually avoid issues like the white-flash FOUC.)

So I&#39;ll relay some comments on your site:<p>- you make sentence-spacing a major design goal. I looked into that a bit ago and I found little or no real evidence that sentence-spacing is a good idea (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/design/typography/sentence-spacing/index" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://gwern.net/doc/design/typography/sentence-spacing/ind...</a>) and it would be expensive to implement: you do the only reasonable thing of injecting &lt;span&gt;s... but oh so many &lt;span&gt;s. If you get long pages like mine, that is going to cost you - DOM nodes are not free, soldier!
- one issue with sentence-spacing is that you are fighting HTML &amp; CSS the entire way. They just do not want to do it. You correctly note that it&#39;s hard, but you accidentally demonstrate it&#39;s even harder than you thought: you have justification enabled but <i>not</i> hyphenation... so all that happens is that sentences get stretched out to make them fully-justified and you get large double-spaces everywhere! Your current implementation winds up being not so much &#39;sentence-spacing&#39; as &#39;every few words spacing&#39;. (This is especially glaring in the sidenotes, like on the page I&#39;m looking at right now, &#39;Stephen Zamadics&#39; looks like &#39;Stephen_________Zamadics&#39;. Since you set the column narrow, you probably want good hyphenation too... perhaps server-side, if you&#39;re deadset against JS.)
- Dropcap positioning is hard, especially if you&#39;d like it to work on more than one browser, and I&#39;m not surprised yours has problems; pretty much everyone screws those up. (At least, I assume you don&#39;t intend the positioning problems like the &#39;1&#39; almost overlapping the &#39;someone&#39; in cases like <a href="https://daveon.design/creating-joy-in-the-user-experience.html#emotion-in-digital-interaction" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://daveon.design/creating-joy-in-the-user-experience.ht...</a> .)
- I think the dotted underlining is too hard to see: much too small and close to the link. Are you sure you don&#39;t need `text-decoration-thickness: from-font` &amp; `text-underline-position: from-font`?
- Rubricating the <i>entire</i> sidenote on hover seems excessive.
- Sidenote numbering is very confusing. They get numbered 1/2/3/4... and then all lose their numbers in favor of &#39;&#39;? Mixing numbered &amp; unnumbered is confusing enough, but then transitioning at the utterly arbitrary &#39;5&#39; let me baffled and wondering if the &#39;&#39;s were supposed to be a separate kind of sidenote like a margin-note. Definitely a case for 0/1/infinity.
- Sidenotes come off as cluttered and hard-to-read, at least partially because they are all 1 big paragraph. Breaking them up would increase readability.

- EB Garamond is a variable font, which is a bit of a questionable choice because OS+browser support is still relatively low. (Just browser-wise, it&#39;s only at ~95% global <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=variable%20font" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://caniuse.com/?search=variable%20font</a> so add on OS incompatibility... The text should still render, but it won&#39;t look like you expect it to. Example: <a href="https://share.obormot.net/screenshots/Arcturus_Screen%20Shot%202023-07-06%20at%208.55.34%20PM.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://share.obormot.net/screenshots/Arcturus_Screen%20Shot...</a> Also shows the sentence-spacing problems &amp; dropcap problems.)
- The use of auto-smallcaps (after H1s, I guess?) winds up feeling busy and confusing. Look at a page like <a href="https://daveon.design/about-dave-on-design.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://daveon.design/about-dave-on-design.html</a> where the sections so short - it winds up feeling like smallcaps is just being sprayed around at random, and the logic is lost.
- Your image dragging widget is mysterious. The icons are unfamiliar and so small that they signal non-interactive.
- am I imagining it or are your &lt;hr&gt;-asterisk-thingies weirdly offset to the right?
- The lack of any header or obvious site navigational apparatus, despite the very large header, makes the site feel somehow cramped and confining. You must like your tree - have you considered the classic HTML approach of an image map?
- The use of triangles in the ToC is a bad idea. They look too much like collapse/disclosures, which are becoming increasingly common, especially in ToCs like this, especially when the reader has already seen you use black-dots for unordered list markers.
- Easter eggs like `X-Clacks-Overhead` are fine, but the page should still validate...

I disagree about Skeleton though. Skeleton makes you feel productive and safe at first but it has a lot of foot-guns. It leads you down a happy path until you don&#39;t like something and then it&#39;s difficult to customize. You&#39;re much better off using DaisyUI or something headless like MeltUI when it&#39;s ready.<p>Take a look at Skeleton&#39;s own site <a href="https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started</a>
Press page down - no scrolling happens. Hover your mouse over the navbar - no scrolling. Print the page - the content is cropped to only what&#39;s shown on the screen. I&#39;ve raised this with them and it hasn&#39;t been a huge priority yet tones of sites are using this pattern from the &lt;AppShell&gt; component. Skeleton thinks you can just take your dark theme, invert the colours and end up with a decent looking light theme which just isn&#39;t the case.</p><p>With DaisyUI you get a more mature/performant/popular framework that takes accessibility seriously. It&#39;s amazing what they can achieve with just CSS animations and no JS. It solves the hard part (HTML, CSS) and let&#39;s you write the easy part (Svelte). You&#39;re also less locked into Svelte - you can much easily pull your DaisyUI html into a different framework.

                  <p><span>Very happy DaisyUI user here. While I like tailwind, I have to agree that for simple things like buttons as mentioning above, it sure is verbose. One of the best aspects of DaisyUI is the wealth of ready-made elements that have very reasonable defaults which often need very little to no tweaking. Of course, you can adjust them as needed very easily. Since we’re on the topic let’s complete the stack: Using DaisyUI and a small GoFiber.io server running Go stdlib HTML templates, I’m able to crank out high performance web apps with minimal fuss. By using the embedding feature in the Go compiler you can ball everything up into a single deployable binary.  For in-page interactivity, I like htmx and/or AlpineJS, depending on the use case. No NodeJS dependencies in sight!</span></p></div></td></tr>

It took a good dozen hours to build, but now it works like a charm while costing nothing to operate or manage.  Now having built this, I have discovered a great and powerful sweet spot between absolute bare minimum and Rails/Phoenix/Django level.

Writing HTML/CSS and not relying on a WYSIWYG back-end editor is an awesome way to work, especially if you&#39;re using a templating engine to generate the static content as mentioned here. However, in my experience the people paying to have websites built or your in-house marketing team maintaining and updating the company website, making sure the SEO is up-to-snuff, etc. can&#39;t do these things. They don&#39;t want to learn how to do these things. The unfortunate truth is that more times than not they require Wordpress or something like it to do their job.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I released a &#34;SvelteKit template for building CMS-free editable websites&#34; earlier this year and the idea has evolved since. I started out with using Postgres + MinIO for storage, but have switched entirely to SQLite. I also added an in-place image cropper, to resize and optimize images on the client side (WebP output) before uploading and storing them in SQLite. I chose Svelte because it&#39;s easy to build classic Web pages (with minimal JS overhead), and at same time implement the reactive layer (e.g. editing) on top of it (will be loaded async). However we are also evaluating the possibility to port this to a LAMP stack at some point. Oh and everything is dynamic here, no build steps involved, edits are live immediately.<p>Just launched my first client project using this approach:</p><p><a href="https://trails-shop.at?editable=true" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://trails-shop.at?editable=true</a> (hit the red button in the bottom-right corner)</p><p>Project website: <a href="https://editable.website" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://editable.website</a></p><p>Source Code: <a href="https://github.com/michael/editable-website">https://github.com/michael/editable-website</a></p><p>HN discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35456083">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35456083</a></p><p>Twitter Thread, that explains how it works under the hood:

I think about sharing the code, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s worth the trouble.</p><p>I&#39;m encouraged to see people here using their noggin, following their bliss, keeping things simple, and I hope this trend catches on.

It&#39;s somewhat similar to learning two frameworks; seeing React&#39;s philosophy makes me a better Vue programmer. In a similar vain, building stuff without tools teaches me a lot about what those tools actually offer me. What stuff is really hard? What stuff is really easy to abstract out? How do Vue/React/Whatever do these things?<p>It also teaches you more about your platform. In the end, all these web tools and frameworks are running in that same browser. I find especially with newer web developers, it&#39;s hard to solve something in React/Vue/.. because they don&#39;t know how to break up the problem. If you&#39;d roughly know how to solve the problem without those frameworks, it becomes much easier to figure out how to solve it with them too.</p><p>Finally, I also just get toolchain fatigue. If I want to build a simple landing page, I don&#39;t want to learn new stuff, I don&#39;t want to read what changed in the latest versions, what the correct way of the day is to set up a project. Honestly, I don&#39;t even want to have a build pipeline and module swapping dev server, that inevitably needs to be configured. Just some static html/css/js is often good enough. And as I said, you also learn which problems frameworks solve well, so you&#39;ll know when some static files isn&#39;t the right choice.

You can build a fast website and even a complex reactive web app with plain HTML, JavaScript and CSS and you don&#39;t need any transpilation step.</p><p>These days browsers have native features that we couldn&#39;t even dream about 10 years ago like HTMLElement (Web Components) which you can use to isolate components (each with their own dependencies) and build reactive front ends with very little boilerplate required. You don&#39;t even need a bundler these days because now there is HTTP2 which allows servers to preemptively push resources to the front end before they were requested by the browser so the round-trip latency argument for using a bundler is gone. Not to mention the script tag now has async and defer attributes to give you fine-grained control over the execution order of scripts on a page or within a component.</p><p>Also, caching controls are on another level nowadays. It&#39;s probably even less efficient to bundle everything into a single file as the whole thing has to be downloaded again each time any change is made to any tiny script...</p><p>I feel like there are all these amazing native features that are being ignored completely in favor of heavily-marketed over-engineered bloatware.</p><p>It boggles the mind... From where I&#39;m standing, it feels like there is a psyop in this industry to make everything as complex as possible. Even the narratives around keeping things simple are over-complicated.</p><p>Junior developers these days are accustomed to a level of complexity that I find unfathomable and they are incapable of seeing through the abstractions. There is all this stuff available in the layers below which is less complicated and provides a more elegant solution than all the abstractions you learned, yet you are discouraged from peeking under the hood.</p><p>All these layers of abstraction offer nothing substantial aside from lock-in factor for certain large tech companies which benefit from people thinking that building software end-to-end is more complicated than it really is.</p><p>How many junior devs were discouraged from building a new website or app because they thought they didn&#39;t have what it takes. They could have done it if they knew: It&#39;s OK, you don&#39;t need to know React or Next.js or NestJS or TypeScript or Tailwind or WebPack or Lambda/serverless or ORMs... There are better technologies and techniques to learn with your time which will make you a better developer much faster and with less pain and unlearning required later...
