And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for
them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being
ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must
be laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear
of punishment.</p><p>And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness
to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
dishonourable.</p><p>Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.</p><p>And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot help --not under the
idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task
of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.

                  <p><span>In my experience, leadership and management are pretty disjoint.  You can be good at one and not good at the other.

                  <p><span>Agree, they are different. Middle managers particularly don&#39;t have to be leaders, and in many cases shouldn&#39;t be. But for things to work well, they do need to be good at management with all of the people skills, cat herding, and organizing that go along with it. In my experiences, the best managers were the ones who protected their teams from the whims of the &#39;leaders&#39; at the higher levels. The worst ones were the ones who carried out their every wish without a second thought.</span></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p><span>Great comment. I was reading a book about Lincoln recently and this exact sense of being compelled was upon him. Him as a politician had him saying things he morally didn’t agree with. Once he won the game, he was able to instill the spirit of his philosophy and do something above society’s morals which we look back upon making him one of the best presidents to date.</span></p></div></td></tr>

The author argues that good people are not ambitious and do not care about honor, so they must be forced to serve out of fear of punishment. The worst punishment, according to the author, is the fear of being ruled by someone who is worse than oneself. This fear is what ultimately compels good people to take office, even though they do not want to and do not expect to benefit from it. The author suggests that good people take office out of a sense of necessity, because they are not able to entrust the task of ruling to anyone who is better than themselves.

No promotion because the system is fucked?  Sorry, you gotta say “better luck next time”. No raises because the company is being cheap? Sorry, gotta say “the cost of labor has not gone up even though inflation is through the roof”. Say what the company tells you, not what’s personally right.</p><p>- Certain kinds of politics where you have to screw over other teams or people in order for your team or reports to not get screwed over. Many companies are very dog eat dog.</p><p>- Layoffs and firing people.  It’s not as bad as getting laid off/fired but firing someone or trying to keep the rest of your team focused when a team member got laid off is not fun at all.</p><p>- Overall, managers almost never get credit when something goes well but are always blamed when something goes wrong. It’s a really thankless job.

However, in the past, this was a widespread phenomenon, and it&#39;s still out there to some extent. You find contributors who think management is easier, or more prestigious, or less prone to ageism, and so will switch tracks.

The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.&#34;

No manager of a team doing technically complex and creative work can for very long remain capable of doing all the work themselves.   Modern projects and processes simply require too much specialized knowledge to function for that to work.   What managers need that (probably) comes from having been a strong individual contributor is sufficient knowledge of the fields involved in what they&#39;re managing to be able to understand the critical elements in the project or process in the context of the overall goal, and to be able to evaluate well the value of ideas for improvement or problem solution that come out of their team.   But they also need leadership and management skills.   The latter are not the same as, and are not developed by, stellar individual contributor skills.   Furthermore, it&#39;s important to understand that management and leadership are not the same thing.<p>My personal experience has been that I was a very able individual contributor, and that I was able to learn leadership skills (that is, how to inspire people; how to recognize their strengths and weaknesses and assign work that played to the former, and created opportunities to ameliorate the latter; how to point individuals and teams in fruitful directions without having (or often being able to) do all the hard work of pushing in that direction myself) by diligent study of people and myself.   But I was never able to become more than a barely competent manager - I always had, by design, an &#34;administrative partner&#34; on my team who brought those abilities to the table - and I always paid attention to what they had to say.   That combination (technical knowledge, leadership skills, and sub-contracted management skills) carried me from individual contributor to team lead, to product line lead, to CTO of highly successful $10B billion medical and technology organization in 20 years.

This is in stark contrast to engineering or manufacturing companies, where engineers make up the highest levels of management and also adjacent areas like running the factories, and generally management prides itself with being hands-on, dropping knowledge and walking through the shop floor frequently.<p>In an agile environment (the most common structure in software development) the professional class of scrum masters and analysts are often non-technical, and management is sparse and hands-off (teams are &#34;self-organized&#34;). Key technical decisions are relegated to senior individual contributors, allowing for CV driven development, cargo culting, and bad habits.

to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot help --not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.
For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention
as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest,
but that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one.&#34;<p>Plato, <i>The Republic</i>

They aren&#39;t the kind of people who don&#39;t understand people and fall into the trap of simply controlling and micro-managing people.</p><p>Let me give you an example of the bad kind. Google&#39;s SWE ladder goes all the say from L3 (new grad) to L9 (ignoring exceptions like Google Fellow and execs). There is an expectation of growth from L3 to L5 (Senior SWE). There is a lot of reward if you can get promoted to L6 (Staff SWE) but it is incredibly difficult. It requires a lot of luck (eg being on the right project that doesn&#39;t get cancelled). Getting to L6 now is <i>much</i> harder than it was 10-15 years ago.</p><p>One of the things Ruth Porat did when she came in was to control costs by reducing the promotion target percentage because it wasn&#39;t visible to people (there was a leaked memo). All promo candidates go to committee and effectively get stack ranked across committees. There is a quota (&#34;target percentage&#34;) of who gets promoted. This creates a backlog and raises the bar for getting promoted. It gives more time for your impact to dissipate or your project to get cancelled (which was your promotion case).</p><p>Compare this to getting promoted as a manager. Your manager level (M0 to M2, which is the same level as L5 to L7) is effectively a function of your head count with the added requirement that M2 requires you to have managers as reports. So if you&#39;re an M0 (which is rare), getting to M1 is typically as easy as getting to 10-15 reports (as long as you don&#39;t screw up so badly).</p><p>So there is a breed of SWEs that bridge these worlds. They&#39;re half an IC and half an EM in the hopes that this gets them over the line.</p><p>In my experience, these managers were generally the absolute worst. They had no interest in ever being a amanager and were just ticking a box for an L6 promotion case. Career development tended to be zero. Everything was seen through the lens of what helped them get promoted. If that means throwing someone under the bus, so be it.</p><p>I think one of the best things Facebook did was they effectively didn&#39;t allow this. Having reports as an IC generally wasn&#39;t allowed. Being an L5 with reports was mostly not allowed. I mean there were some exceptions in some orgs and for some people but it was exceedingly rare. You&#39;d see people ask &#34;why can&#39;t I be a manager at L5?&#34; and you heavily suspected the main motivator for this question was an inability to get promoted to L6 as a SWE.

I know for a fact that he dislikes lots of meeting and really likes working on the core product, and so far hasn&#39;t really jumped on the opportunity to go into management - he doesn&#39;t <i>really</i> want to be manager. So he is kind of exactly the guy the post is describing.

I believe he is going to be a great manager though.

This leads to a situation of people managers who care less about managing people than managing delivery and technology strategy. The best of those also have a lot of empathy and inadvertently are good at people management.<p>Another reason, often related in my experience, is a lot of companies careers plateau for ICs pretty early on. Your comp stops growing beyond COLA, titles exhaust, and despite being young you’re at a terminal career velocity. The only thing way to break up is to become management. This isn’t surprising - who controls promotion and comp other than managers, and why on earth wouldn’t they structure things to reward themselves and people like them?  There are many companies that have recognized this and created IC paths parallel to management, at least up to the C level. However the relative difficulty in achieving them is disproportionately weighted against the IC vs manager. At Amazon there’s a crap ton of VP and Director managers. But it’s absurdly hard to get senior principal or distinguished engineer. The rationale is they want to keep the prestige of the level high for IC. But that’s weird - the prestige of the same level in management must therefore be low and why is the bar different for the same level if you’re managing vs building?

So, the most desirable workplaces can maybe attract all the GICs to fill out middle management, whereas the less desirable workplaces have to stick with PMs because GICs won&#39;t work for them.<p>In theory GICs could work their way into management organically in any organization, but it would require both that they be willing to take on a management role and that the organization is able to recognize who the GICs are.</p><p>(There are also some GICs who just shouldn&#39;t be managers because they&#39;re unusually bad at dealing with people.  They&#39;re probably the minority, but they exist.)

I didn&#39;t want to be a leader. I don&#39;t want to tell people what to do. I don&#39;t want to give orders everyone else has to follow. I like the team approach. 
But people are conditioned to follow.
Except they aren&#39;t following... when you apply too much pressure.</p><p>I set up a website to plan raids. Paid for a domain. Went through the hassle to configure it and a discord server and a bridge between those and all I wanted was that people fucking sign up or off from raids.
I asked them when they&#39;re available and made a plan most people are comfortable with. 
Only 5 out of 30 people did even register on the site.
They joined the guild because it was advertised as a raid guild with social spots but raid being the main theme. A RAID GUILD.
After 2 months I was so stressed out that I simply abandoned the guild and left the game.</p><p>I can&#39;t do everything alone. When I said that I never felt so stressed out in all my life 2 people offered to help with leading raids but at that point it was too late. Some players joined from other guilds,  got spell upgrades for free, then left the guild. Some people joined from other guilds to cause drama and distress.</p><p>This is of course not real life. But it&#39;s close. You don&#39;t pay your members money for work and can&#39;t expect they follow guidelines. But holy crap, can you at least expect some interest in the main theme of the guild and them to sign up on the site and sign on and off of raids?</p><p>I never wanted to be leader. I feel well in the role of an advisor, someone who helps lead. But not the sole person responsible for everything. I&#39;m not perfect. No one is. I was overwhelmed because every piece of the hierarchy in the end asked me what to do. And if I postponed answering things would get worse.</p><p>In software development I can be agile and change things around, but people demand stability. They want a bed already made but are not willing to do the effort to build that bed.</p><p>In retrospect I should&#39;ve continued and &#34;fired&#34; 90% of the members even if that meant the end of independent raiding. But I was too stressed out and losing key people,  because that game was designed around key roles being present in a raid.
I didn&#39;t make the necessary decisions because I didn&#39;t want to lose anyone and not piss anyone of. But in the end key people left regardless. 
So lesson learned if you do something, focus on just doing that one thing and don&#39;t get ballast on board in the first place. It&#39;s better to have a small, dedicated group, seeing  eye to eye, than a large group where the majority doesn&#39;t care about success.</p><p>Anyhow, see I wasn&#39;t a good manager, despite me not wanting to be a manager.

But if you look at them most were just accidental and he only recognized them as success when they hit him in the face.</p><p>* Apple didn&#39;t &#34;invent&#34; the Mac, all of it&#39;s technologies were copied straight out of Xerox&#39;s Palo Alto research center. He found them in a demo.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t &#34;invent&#34; Pixar. George Lucas and Ed Catmull did it. His project was to create an hardware company (the only thing he knew to do) and to sell it. But Pixar &#34;accidentally&#34; found success creating animated intros for commercials and television shows and Jobs did nothing to discover this early market.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the iPhone. He was scared of dealing in an area where Apple didn&#39;t have expertise and tought it would be dangerous (a call to 911 failing because the phone could be stuck in a processing task). It took years of internal pressure by Apple engineers and management and a personal fiasco on a Nokia phone with iTunes for him to accept the iPhone.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the AppStore. For the first 6 months the iPhone didn&#39;t had an AppStore because he tought it would relinquish control of the platform to others. He only accepted it because in these first 6 months the iPhone sales were a disaster. He accepted the AppStore because the customers were screamming for it. It was the AppStore that saved the iPhone.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the Apple I, Wozniak did it. And the idea to turn the kit into a functional computer was not Jobs&#39;. It was a precondition imposed by a RadioShack manager.</p><p>* NEXT wasn&#39;t a commercial success. An expensive computer for college students with a black and white monitor was not selling enough to sustain the company. He was basically lucky that at the same time, Apple under Sculley, was a much bigger failure and the management board called him back.</p><p>&#34;Reality distortion field&#34; and &#34;stealing&#34; other people&#39;s ideas were Jobs&#39; greatest talents. But then, these are the talents of most cult founders from Jim Jones to Donald Trump.

                        <p>We continue building our microservices system by adding a coordination layer to handle spinning multiple services up and down.</p>
<p>In previous articles, we grew from two Spring Boot applications to three applications + a database container.</p>
<p>As we continue to scale and broaden our system, we will need something to coordinate service and ensure consistent communication (avoid human error).</p>
<p>We will do this through <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>docker-compose</code></a>, an orchestration tool that manages containerized applications.</p>
<p>For our project, this means we have two high-level steps to get managed microservice containers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Containerize our currently-local applications</li>
<li>Set up the management layer with Docker Compose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these may seem daunting, but I ran into a few unexpected gotchas, which I will be sure to mention. 🙂</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="_architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>We began this project with minimum functionality explained in the <a href="https://jmhreif.com/blog/microservices-level1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">level 1 blog post</a>. Currently, our microservices system consists of three services and a database container. While still pretty small in the microservices world, issues like coordination are already surfacing, so this is a good time to introduce orchestration tools like Docker Compose that attempt to reduce that pain.</p>
<p>The services or functionality have not changed from the previous blog post, but the management of them has.</p>
<p>Here is the updated architecture:</p>
<p><picture decoding="async">

<img decoding="async" src="https://foojay.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/microservices-level5.png" alt="microservices level5"/>
</picture>
</p>
<p>The border around each service represents the container housing each application. All of the services are encompassed in a larger grey area that shows how Docker Compose groups these services together. Containerizing our applications means a couple of code changes to minimize environment or configuration changes later. The first of these is to create additional methods in each service for testing.</p>
<h2 id="_added_test_methods">Added test methods</h2>
<p>I ran into some errors when testing endpoints, but it was hard to tell the root cause (database, authentication, Docker compose, or something else entirely). To help debugging, I added a method to each service called <code>liveCheck()</code> that elimiates a database call, returning a string to confirm our service is up.</p>
<p>I also added a method to <code>service1</code> and <code>service3</code> that returns a single entity (book or author), so if network is slow or the database has trouble returning all the objects, I can test a single result.</p>
<p>All code for these methods is on Github, linked for each service below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service1: <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level5/blob/main/service1/src/main/java/com/jmhreif/service1/Service1Application.java#L32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liveCheck() and getBook() methods</a></li>
<li>Service2: <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level5/blob/main/service2/src/main/java/com/jmhreif/service2/Service2Application.java#L37" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liveCheck() method</a></li>
<li>Service3: <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level5/blob/main/service3/src/main/java/com/jmhreif/service3/Service3Application.java#L33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liveCheck() and getAuthor() methods</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_containerizing_service_1">Containerizing - Service 1</h2>
<p>To create a container for service1, we need a Dockerfile in the application folder (<code>/service1</code>).</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="text">#Pull base image
#-----------------

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors=&#34;Jennifer Reif,<a href="https://foojay.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5c36393232353a392e1c28343934393f3730392e2f72332e3b">[email protected]</a>,@JMHReif&#34;

ENTRYPOINT [&#34;java&#34;,&#34;-jar&#34;,&#34;/goodreads-svc1.jar&#34;]</pre>
<p>First, I want a Java environment in the container, so Docker will pull openjdk’s version 11 image as the base layer. Next, is the author/maintainer information so users know who to contact. Lastly, there are a couple of instructions to copy the JAR file (packaged application) into the container (<code>COPY</code>) and then add commands/arguments for the build command (<code>ENTRYPOINT</code>).</p>
<p>In the next section, we will see how to prepare for a containerized application.</p>
<h3 id="_service_1_packaging_the_application">Service 1 - packaging the application</h3>
<p>The first step is to package the app into a .jar file by running <code>mvn clean package</code> from the service1 folder.</p>
<p><em>*Note:* Assumes Maven is installed. You can verify by running <code>mvn --version</code> at the command line. If it is not found, you can download it from the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maven website</a>.</em></p>
<p>Once you package the application, you can verify by navigating to the service1 <code>target</code> folder and checking whether there is a <code>service1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> as in the screenshot below.</p>

</p>
<p>Next, we could go ahead and build this individual container, but we want to manage all of the containers together. Instead, we will use wait and use Docker compose, so let’s do the same steps for service2.</p>
<h2 id="_containerizing_service_2">Containerizing - Service 2</h2>
<p>Creating a container for service2 looks nearly identical to what we did above, with only differing names for the application’s filename.</p>
<p>For brevity, <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level5/blob/main/service2/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Service2’s Dockerfile</a> is on Github.</p>
<h3 id="_service_2_packaging_the_application">Service 2 - packaging the application</h3>
<p>We also need to package the service2 application. From the service2 folder, we run the <code>mvn clean package</code> command to bundle up the application. We can verify it worked by checking the <code>target</code> folder to find a <code>service2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code> file.</p>
<p>Let’s do the same for service3, for the third and final time!</p>
<h2 id="_containerizing_service_3">Containerizing - Service 3</h2>
<p>Steps for service3 mirror what we have done for the previous two services, so we will condense with a link to <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level5/blob/main/service3/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service3’s Dockerfile</a> on Github.</p>
<h3 id="_service_3_packaging_the_application">Service 3 - packaging the application</h3>
<p>We will run <code>mvn clean package</code> in the service3 folder, which we can verify in the <code>target</code> folder with a file named <code>service3-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to set up Docker Compose to manage all of our prepped services.</p>
<h2 id="_docker_compose_for_everything">Docker compose for everything</h2>
<p>We need to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YAML</a> file with container details, configuration, and commands we want Compose to execute.</p>
<p>At the high level, we will list each of our services, then specify subfields for each. We will also set up a dedicated network for all of the containers to run on. Let’s build the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> piece by piece in the main project folder.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="text">version: &#34;3.9&#34;
services:
  goodreads-db:
    container_name: goodreads-db
    image: jmreif/mongodb
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=mongoadmin
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=Testing123
    ports:
      - &#34;27017:27017&#34;
    networks:
      - goodreads
    volumes:
      - $HOME/Projects/docker/mongoBooks/data:/data/db
      - $HOME/Projects/docker/mongoBooks/logs:/logs
      - $HOME/Projects/docker/mongoBooks/tmp:/tmp</pre>
<p>The first field displays the Docker compose version, though it is not required. Next, we will list our services. Instead of running our database container separately as we have been, we include it here so that Docker Compose handles everything. The child fields for each service contain a few details and configurations. We will go through those in the next subsections.</p>
<h3 id="_goodreads_db">Goodreads-db</h3>
<p>Under <code>goodreads-db</code>, we have the container name, so we can reference and identify the container by name. The image field specifies whether we want to use an existing image (as we have done here) or create a new image.</p>
<p><em>*Note:* I am running on Apple silicon architecture. If you are not, you will need to build your own version of the image with the <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level5/tree/main/docker-mongodb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions provided on Github</a>. This will build the container locally with your architecture.</em></p>
<p>The next field sets environment variables for the database container for connecting to the database with the provided credentials (username and password). Specifying ports comes next, where we map the host post to the container port, allowing traffic to flow between our local machine and the container via the same port number. <em>*Note:* It is recommended to enclose the <code>port</code> field values with quotes, as shown.</em></p>
<p>Next, we have a <code>networks</code> field, which specifies a custom network that we want this container to join. This was the part that took some time to figure out. Docker compose documentation has a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page dedicated to networking</a>, but I found the critical information easy to miss.</p>
<p>To summarize, if we do not specify a custom network in the Docker compose file, it will create a default network. Each container will only be able to communicate with other containers on that network via IP address. This means if containerA wants to talk to containerB, a call would look like <code><code>curl </code></code><a href="http://127.0.0.2:8080">http://127.0.0.2:8080</a>. However, if IP addresses expire or rotate, then any references would need to dynamically retrieve the container’s IP address before calling.</p>
<p>One way around this is to create a custom network, which allows containers to reference one another by container name, instead of just IP address. This an improvement, both to solve dynamic IP issues, as well as human memory/reference issues. Therefore, this is what we have done by using the <code>networks</code> field for each service, then defining the network itself at the bottom of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>.</p>
<p>The final subfield in the <code>goodreads-db</code> service is to mount volumes from the local machine to the container, allowing my database to store the data files with our book and author data in a permanent place so that the loaded data does not disappear when the container shuts down. Instead, each time the container spins up, the data is already there, and each time it spins down, any changes are stored for the next startup.</p>
<p>Now that we got through our first service definition, the following ones should be faster. Let’s look at the <code>goodreads-svc1</code> next.</p>
<h3 id="_goodreads_svc1">Goodreads-svc1</h3>
<pre data-enlighter-language="text">......
  goodreads-svc1:
    container_name: goodreads-svc1
    image: jmreif/goodreads-svc1
    ports:
      - &#34;8081:8081&#34;
    depends_on:
      - goodreads-db
    networks:
      - goodreads
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongoadmin:<a href="https://foojay.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7a2e1f090e13141d4b48493a1d15151e081f1b1e09571e18">[email protected]</a>:27017
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_DATABASE=goodreads</pre>
<p>We use the familiar <code>container_name</code>, <code>image</code>, and <code>ports</code> fields. After that, we specify one new field called <code>depends_on</code> that lists any services service1 depends on for startup and shut down. In other words, if the database service is not up, then service1 cannot start because all of its functionality relies on making calls to the database.</p>
<p>Next, we have the <code>networks</code> field that says we want service1 to also be on the custom network of <code>goodreads</code> (along with our database service). The last field for environment externalizes our connection details for the application to connect to the database.</p>
<p>If you look at service1’s <code>application.properties</code> file, you will see that the fields and values nearly match. The first change is that the format. Spring properties have <code>name.name</code> (lowercase, dot separation), and environment properties use <code>NAME_NAME</code> (uppercase, underscore separation). We also changed the URI to reference the container name of <code>goodreads-db</code> instead of the localhost in the application. Spring will first create a priority for the environment variables, and if those do not exist, fall back on local variables. This means that our configuration in the docker-compose.yml will be used first. However, if we test locally, those environment variables will not exist, and it will use localhost. So, our application will work in different environments dynamically!</p>
<p>Next is service2.</p>
<h3 id="_goodreads_svc2">Goodreads-svc2</h3>
<pre data-enlighter-language="text">......
  goodreads-svc2:
    container_name: goodreads-svc2
    image: jmreif/goodreads-svc2
    ports:
      - &#34;8080:8080&#34;
    depends_on:
      - goodreads-svc1
    networks:
      - goodreads
    environment:
      - BACKEND_HOSTNAME=goodreads-svc1</pre>
<p>Service2 configuration looks very similar to service1, except for the environment variable. What is the <code>BACKEND_HOSTNAME=goodreads-svc1</code>? If you take a quick look at the <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level4/blob/main/service2/src/main/java/com/jmhreif/service2/Service2Application.java#L30" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code for service2 in level4</a>, you might recall that we hard-coded a <code>localhost</code> value for the WebClient bean. This will not work in a Docker network because it is separate from the host machine’s network. We need to reference containers by name, instead. However, we also want to be dynamic and test in local environments (localhost), as well as production environments (Docker Compose).</p>
<p>To do this, we will create a dynamic variable with <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-value-annotation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spring’s <code>@Value</code> annotation</a> and set that in our Docker compose file using an environment variable. This is similar to what we did with the environment variables in service1. If Docker compose finds the environment variable, it will use that value; otherwise, it will use localhost.</p>
<p>Our updated code in our <code>service2</code> application is below.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="java">@SpringBootApplication
public class Service2Application {
	@Value(&#34;${backend.hostname:localhost}&#34;)
	private String hostname;

	...&lt;main&gt;...

	@Bean
	WebClient client() {
		return WebClient.create(&#34;http://&#34; + hostname + &#34;:8081&#34;);
	}
}</pre>
<p>In the code above, we create a String variable with <code>@Value</code> that looks for <code>backend.hostname</code> value first. If it doesn’t find it, the value falls back to localhost value. Then, in the <code>@Bean</code> definition, we insert the variable <code>hostname</code> in the middle of the URL.</p>
<p>Next, we need to set the environment variable for <code>BACKEND_HOSTNAME</code> in the Docker compose file to equal the container name (in this case, <code>goodreads-svc1</code>). This creates our dynamic hostname, so that running in a local or Docker environment will allow it to work without any changes.</p>
<p>Changes to the application need to be repackaged, so we can go back to the service2 folder from the command line and re-run <code>mvn clean package</code> to update the JAR file.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to service3.</p>
<h3 id="_goodreads_svc3">Goodreads-svc3</h3>
<pre data-enlighter-language="text">......
  goodreads-svc3:
    container_name: goodreads-svc3
    image: jmreif/goodreads-svc3
    ports:
      - &#34;8082:8082&#34;
    depends_on:
      - goodreads-db
    networks:
      - goodreads
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongoadmin:<a href="https://foojay.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2c78495f5845424b1d1e1f6c4b4343485e494d485f01484e">[email protected]</a>:27017
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_DATABASE=goodreads</pre>
<p>We have all of the same fields (and some of the same values) for <code>service3</code> as we did for <code>service1</code> because both services are rest apis for the database container. Both services need to depend on the database container running, and both define environment variables for connecting to it.</p>
<p>The last piece is to define our custom network.</p>
<h3 id="_docker_compose_yml_network">docker-compose.yml network</h3>
<pre data-enlighter-language="text">networks:
  goodreads:</pre>
<p>We need to define a high-level field that defines our custom Docker network that all of the services will join in order to communicate with one another using container names. The <code>networks</code> field states any custom network names along with any potential configurations. Since we don’t need anything fancy, the network <code>goodreads</code> is the only thing required.</p>
<p>You can view the <a href="https://github.com/JMHReif/microservices-level5/blob/main/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file</a> on Github.</p>
<h2 id="_put_it_to_the_test">Put it to the test</h2>
<p>Docker compose will handle starting all of the containers in the proper order, so all we need to do is assemble the command.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="shell">docker-compose up -d</pre>
<p><em>*Note:* If you are building local images with the <code>build</code> field in docker-compose.yml, then use the command <code>docker-compose up -d --build</code>. This will build the Docker containers each time on startup from the directories.</em></p>
<p>The containers should spin up, and we can verify them with <code>docker ps</code>. Output for starting the services and verifying they are running is shown below.</p>

<p>Next, we can test our endpoints.</p>
<ol>
<li>Service1: open a browser and check the service is live with <code>localhost:8081/db</code> or go to command line with <code>curl localhost:8081/db</code>. Then, test the dataset with <code>localhost:8081/db/books</code> and <code>localhost:8081/db/book/623a1d969ff4341c13cbcc6b</code>.</li>
<li>Service2: open a browser and check the service is live with <code>localhost:8080/goodreads</code> or go to command line with <code>curl localhost:8080/goodreads</code>. Then, test the dataset with <code>localhost:8080/goodreads/books</code>.</li>
<li>Service3: open a browser and check the service is live with <code>localhost:8082/db</code> or go to command line with <code>curl localhost:8082/db</code>. Then, test the dataset with <code>localhost:8082/db/authors</code> and <code>localhost:8082/db/623a48c1b6575ea3e899b164</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When everything looks good, we can run <code>docker-compose down</code>, which will stop each of the services in necessary order and remove those along with the custom network. Clearing everything out will help give us a clean run each time we start the services.</p>
<h2 id="_wrapping_up">Wrapping up!</h2>
<p>This post covered quite a bit of material, although we did not alter or add any more services. We added a couple extra methods to each service to help us test/debug issues with the applications, then we packaged the applications into JAR files. Next, we created Dockerfiles for each service that would allow Docker to create a container that copies and executes the service JAR.</p>
<p>We then tackled Docker Compose, which manages the services together using information we specify in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. We also covered the tricky &#34;gotchas&#34; with Docker networks and handled dynamic runtimes with environment variables and the <code>@Value</code> annotation.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw how to run everything with a single <code>docker-compose</code> command and how to test each of our endpoints to our applications still operate as expected. When we are done, we can run another <code>docker-compose</code> command that stops the system and cleans out the setup, so we have a clean environment when we want to run again.</p>
<p>There is so much more we can explore with microservices, such as adding more data sources, additional services, asynchronous communication through messaging platforms, cloud deployments, and much more. I hope to catch you in future improvements on this project. Happy coding!</p>
