<p>When someone tells you that a particular video game (like Elden Ring) is hard, it can be tough to figure out what they might mean by that because games are hard in different ways. As Tolstoy might have said had he been a gamer: “All easy games are alike; each difficult game is difficult in its own way.”</p>

<p>Two recent articles have attempted to categorize the different ways in which players are challenged while playing games. Back in September 2021, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/blogs/a-new-taxonomy-of-difficulty">Rhys Frampton outlined three main types of difficulty</a>: comprehensive, executive, and strategic. Comprehensive difficulty relates to understanding the rules of the game while executive difficulty is about physicality (e.g. fast reflexes, coordination). Strategic difficulty relates to how to use your understanding of the rules and your reflexes to best master the game, your opponent, or yourself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Once you understand a task’s goals, as well as the physical abilities required to perform the task’s actions, your final hurdle will be optimizing those actions to most effectively achieve those goals. This is strategic difficulty, the third and final category, and it is often the trickiest both to overcome and define. To demonstrate this, examine the difference between an intermediate Go player and a master. Both of them fully understand the game’s rules, while also being capable of reliably moving their pieces to any desired spot on the board — thus, they both have an equal mastery of Go’s comprehensive and executive difficulty. However, the Go master will always win against the intermediate player, because they have a superior understanding of Go’s strategic difficulty (i.e., the various tactics and divergent outcomes that will best lead them to victory). Go is a particularly important case subject for those interested in strategic difficulty, because despite being very simple to pick up and play, its strategic depths have still not been fully mastered even after thousands of years. Within the framework of “what,” “how,” and “why,” strategic difficulty represents “why,” and Go is one of the only examples of an activity whose difficulty is almost solely strategic.</p></blockquote>

<p>I found Frampton’s piece via Clive Thompson, <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/the-different-flavors-of-video-game-pain-23e8bfd0c0fa">who riffs briefly on it here</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">Ars Technica’s Kyle Orland listed</a> “five noncomprehensive subcategories” of gaming difficulty. Mechanical difficulty is about reflexes, punishing difficulty relates to how much of penalty you pay for mistakes (e.g. does the game make you start from the beginning when you die), arcane difficulty is about how much the game helps you learn to play, grindable difficulty is about the game giving you an option to power up via spending a lot of time performing tedious actions, and difficulty walls is about the presence of “impassable walls that fully impeded a player’s progress”. About grindable difficulty, Orland says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Even the hardest mountain can be ground down by a gentle stream if given enough time. Similarly, some games that seem tough at first can eventually be completed if you’re willing to put in the time to grind out improvements to your character’s power level.</p>

<p>In a game like Super Meat Boy, there’s no item you can find to make a difficult series of jumps any easier. In Elden Ring, on the other hand, the game can become significantly easier as you put in more time collecting the runes and items needed to power up your character level, weapons, and spells.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s unclear whether Orland read Frampton’s piece or not (there’s no reference to it in the article), but there’s both overlap and not between the two systems. I am sure there is prior art here, both related to video games and in describing the various types of athletic or intellectual challenges — let me know if you know of anything I should read about. But anyway, it’s interesting to think about this stuff in the context of games I like to play and ones that I really really do not…and also in hobbies I like to do and don’t.</p>

	<p>What does artistic freedom mean in times of political upheaval? Does it mean escapism, giving a crowd liberation from distress? Being beholden to tell the stories of those who can’t? Does it mean freedom of personal expression? Does it simply mean to have fun? </p>

<p>With <a href="https://boxd.it/nQDE"><em>Inu-oh</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/director/masaaki-yuasa/">Masaaki Yuasa</a> answers “yes”.</p>
<p>The latest film from one of the most exciting directors currently working,<em> Inu-oh</em> is another feather in Yuasa’s cap, continuing a decade-long streak directing animation that’s as soulful as it is experimental. The film is set in Japan’s 14th century Muromachi period, after the dust has settled from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dan-no-ura" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Battle of Dan-no-ura</a>, which took place three hundred years prior, resulting in destruction of the Heike clan.</p>
<p><em>Inu-oh</em>’s characters race against the wheel of history while singing songs of those who were broken under it, building a fandom as they go. Throughout, Yuasa throws as many genres at the wall as he does visual ideas, and inserts wild rock performances into the medieval setting, complete with fire breathers, knee slides, breakdancing and behind-the-head biwa solos. It’s the most lavish and creative work yet from the director.</p>

		<p>Yuasa is a filmmaker who has for a long time gleefully smashed tradition and structure to pieces. There’s the abstract, freeform animation interpolated with live-action imagery in the dimension-hopping, time-traveling college story <a href="https://boxd.it/oL50"><em>The Tatami Galaxy</em></a>; there’s the psychedelic head trip<em> </em><a href="https://boxd.it/1Bv2"><em>Mind Game</em></a>, the apocalyptic <a href="https://boxd.it/muwa"><em>Devilman Crybaby</em>.</a> While something like<em> </em><a href="https://boxd.it/ffwA"><em>Night is Short, Walk on Girl </em></a>embraced an abstract and cartoonish flatness in its imagery, <em>Inu-oh</em> is full of volume alongside its expressionist style, playing with various mixed media—3D digital animation as well as more traditional methods, the camera swooping through various stages to lay the groundwork for the performance to come.</p>
<p>Adapted from Hideo Furukawa’s novel, <em>Inu-oh</em> follows the creative partnership between Tomona, a traveling biwa priest (who at the time traditionally recounted stories of the dead Heike clan through their songs), and Inu-oh, the outcast son of an esteemed Noh theatre troupe, who was cursed by a demon before his birth, and now covers his appearance behind a mask and altered clothes. After discovering each other&#39;s talents—Tomona’s ability to truly shred the biwa (a short-necked lute), Inu-oh’s spectacular dance moves, both with astonishing vocal power—they form a musical union.</p>

		<p>Things take another, supernatural twist through their interaction with the wandering spirits of dead Heike, the two discovering new stories yet untold. They decide to tell them in a revolutionary way: through Noh theatre that rocks, conducting themselves in a manner a lot like Queen, David Bowie and other glam rock contemporaries—<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5HzXOIWT0wyDXT5Lc210B0?si=g79AkBlPSFWSrarpNr0CrA" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">you can hear it in the film&#39;s incredible score</a> from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/composer/otomo-yoshihide/">Otomo Yoshihide</a>, the ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’-esque, thirteen-minute epic ‘Dragon Commander’ (track 19 in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5HzXOIWT0wyDXT5Lc210B0?si=1fAPv7zdSKe1D9hF8VvwqA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the film’s soundtrack</a>) or its counterpart, ‘The Whale’ (track 15), which lifts the drumbeat from ‘We Will Rock You’.</p>
<p><em>Inu-oh</em> has been a hit at its various film festival playdates since a Venice premiere last year. My own emphatic opinion—<a href="https://letterboxd.com/journal/drawing-closer/">from the work-in-progress stage</a> to <a href="https://letterboxd.com/journal/drawn-into-2022-animation-anticipation/">its festival premieres</a> and now<a href="https://letterboxd.com/kambole/film/inu-oh/2/"> its US release</a>—is well-documented around here, and I’m not alone. Letterboxd correspondent <a href="https://letterboxd.com/socialanigirl/film/inu-oh/1/">Alicia Haddick writes of the film</a> “<em>Inu-oh</em> is just Masaaki Yuasa creating his dream movie tribute to Queen in Heike/Genji garb and dropping the mic,” continuing, “there’s a psychedelic beauty to how Yuasa has transformed his unique creative style into a condensed form of how music and performance can transform and condense the art of storytelling.” In the same spirit, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/sting/film/inu-oh/">STinG notes</a> that, “not a single frame of its sleek 93-minute runtime is wasted” while <a href="https://boxd.it/35dpvN">Cinemateq writes</a>, “the whale song slaps.”</p>

	<p>I jumped on the line with Masaaki Yuasa for a short chat about visualizing a new type of Noh theater, taking a sideways approach to historical drama, and how attitudes and trends of the past—both authoritative and rebellious—are recursive.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>You’ve had musical sequences in your films before, like in <em>Night Is Short, Walk on Girl </em>and </strong><a href="https://boxd.it/ftYy"><strong><em>Lu Over the Wall</em></strong></a><strong>. Was a full-on concert film such as this always in the back of your mind?<br/></strong><em>Masaaki Yuasa</em>: For this project, it just happened to land on my lap, but I always thought movements and music were a great form of expression instead of words. When movement and music come together, it’s really a strong form of how I can express myself.</p>
<p><strong>In the film, you reference a lot of contemporary artists in the way that Tomona performs and moves, like how he plays the biwa behind his head and with his teeth. What did you enjoy most about bringing modern artists back into this era?<br/></strong>I think it was necessary to have elements that people would think wouldn’t happen in the Muromachi era. It was important for history to be depicted in a way where we could imagine more than what’s written down in history. Basically, I didn’t want to restrict myself to what was written down as a resource in depicting this period. But actually, when you look into research in the past, like playing a musical instrument behind your head, it was depicted in a picture in ancient China. So more than we imagine, maybe people did the same things that we do right now, in the old times.</p>

		<p><strong>Since you worked before with character designer Taiyō Matsumoto-san on<em> </em></strong><a href="https://boxd.it/oL1s"><strong><em>Ping Pong the Animation</em></strong></a><strong>, how did you collaborate together on <em>Inu-oh</em>?<br/></strong>This time it started off with Mr. Matsumoto, who drew the cover art for the original novel. I had him basically draw freely at first, and then from there we really went into the details, deciding the details of Inu-oh and Tomona, but we also did a lot of different things, like we went to go watch Noh together, too.</p>
<p><strong>I was really interested by Inu-oh and Tomona’s gender fluidity in their appearance. Were there any other performers that inspired the way that these characters look and dress?<br/></strong>What I really wanted to depict with their gender fluidity was that they’re both very free. Free of restrictions, like nothing holds them back. In creating their characters, I was influenced by a lot of things. Not just musicians, but also ballet dancers or athletes. A lot of different elements went into creating those characters.</p>
	</div>
 
				
					

 
				
					
<div>
	<p><strong>Speaking of Noh—during Tomona and Inu-oh’s performances, the stage has all of this intricate detail in how the mechanics of everything are moving. Why portray it realistically, instead of more abstract like you have in the past?<br/></strong>Because this is a period piece, I wanted to depict something realistic but that [also] jumps into more of a fantasy. I wanted something to be able to explain to people who would watch <em>Inu-oh</em> and would say things like, “That would never happen.” But we could say, “No, no, no, this is how it happened.” Like, it’s possible. I wanted an explanation or sort of an excuse and I didn’t want people watching the film to think that everything is a fantasy, because it is based on reality.</p>

		<span><p>By preemptively taking action if you expect to receive a bad performance review, you may be able to steer a different course for yourself and avoid a foregone conclusion — or at least feel better about the outcome. The author offers six steps to take before and after your review if you know your performance has been subpar. First, reflect on your own assumptions about your performance to understand what you need to work on. Second, get your teammates’ perspective. Third, proactively invite your manager to have a conversation with you — and be direct with them. Fourth, own up to your mistakes and put together a plan to improve. Fifth, follow up on that plan with your manager. Finally, show your manager you care about doing better. If you still receive a negative review despite your best efforts to be proactive, it may help you realize that your skills, strengths, and interests don’t align with the needs of your current role.</p>

<p>Dan, a client I coached through a career transition, started working with me after being laid off. Prior to being let go, Dan’s company had put him on a performance improvement plan, or “PIP,” as it’s euphemistically called in HR. Although he was aware that he had areas to work on, Dan thought his job was safe and that he’d have a longer timeframe to better his performance. He thus found himself totally blindsided when he was fired.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, while disappointing, Dan’s situation isn’t uncommon. Organizations frequently use a PIP with the intention of gathering enough evidence about an employee’s underperformance to justify firing them, rather than to truly help them improve. Since employees often remain in the dark about this motive and believe that the tool is put in place by their employer to help them grow, many like Dan may realize too late that they’re on the chopping block. However, by preemptively taking action if you expect to receive a bad performance review, you may be able to steer a different course for yourself and avoid a foregone conclusion — or at least feel better about the outcome.</p> 
<p>Here are some steps to take before and after your review if you know your performance has been subpar.</p> 
<h2>Reflect on your assumptions.</h2> 
<p>Before jumping to conclusions about how your manager may evaluate you, take some time to check your assumptions in the weeks prior to your review, when there’s still time to turn things around. One of my coaching clients, a VP of product development, was unsure how the CEO and CFO perceived her performance. Instead of worrying about it or making assumptions, she set up a time with each of them and simply asked:<strong><br/> </strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>What have I done in the last six months that has contributed the most to the company?</li> 
 <li>What could I have done more of?</li> 
 <li>What should I have done less of?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In addition to asking for feedback, you can also ask yourself the following questions, recommended by executive coach and workplace culture consultant Chris Littlefield:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Why do I think I will get a poor review, and why now?</li> 
 <li>What specific results did I commit to that I didn’t deliver?</li> 
 <li>How does my current performance compare to the past?</li> 
 <li>Did I have an interaction with a client or coworker that did not go as I planned? What happened? Why?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These questions and your answers will enable you to focus on the specific work you need to do to improve rather than on an amorphous goal. For example, did you commit to meeting X goal by Y date and failed to do so? If so, is it possible to address this shortfall now and make amends, showing your boss that you’re capable of graciously correcting an error in a timely manner? By asking yourself Littlefield’s questions, you may also discover that you’ve erroneously assumed that there’s a problem when in fact, there’s no tangible justification for your fears. If you found that your assumptions were off base, it may be that your <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/what-self-awareness-really-is-and-how-to-cultivate-it">self-awareness needs a tune-up</a>.</p> 
<h2>Gain perspective.</h2> 
<p>If you sense your teammates are frustrated with you, don’t avoid the issue or guess — ask them before it’s too late! Addressing the situation prior to your review can remove this red flag from your record. This situation happened to one of my coaching clients, who was frequently late on deliverables and failed to alert her team. Worse yet, she tended to blame her delays on external circumstances, such as not receiving the information she needed on time instead of searching it out.</p> 
<p>If you’re not sure how your team perceives your contributions, executive and team coach Jennifer Porter <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/to-improve-your-team-first-work-on-yourself">suggests asking your teammates</a>:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>What am I doing as part of the team that is helpful?</li> 
 <li>What am I doing that is not helpful?</li> 
 <li>If you could change one part of how I interact with the team, what would it be?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Once you receive their answers, take steps to rectify any areas that your team flagged. Better to take it upon yourself to do better than to hear about it from your boss in a PIP.</p> 
<h2>Invite your manager for a conversation.</h2> 
<p>Rather than waiting for a formal performance review, Fortune 50 executive coach Nihar Chhaya suggests reaching out to your manager to discuss your development prior to your review, asking for 20 to 30 minutes so no one feels rushed. This is particularly important if you’ve made a big mistake, adds C-suite coach Amii Barnard-Bahn, who advises acting fast. “Being direct and willing to discuss your mishap serves a few purposes,” says Chhaya. “It gives you the chance to show you care about your career and performance and aren’t just complacent or deferring ownership and responsibility to others.”</p> 
<p>If you have a manager who isn’t straightforward at delivering difficult feedback, your invitation to talk about it precludes them from delaying or being unclear with you about their assessment. Sometimes, as much as you don’t want to invite criticism, making it easier for managers to deliver it can ultimately put you in higher standing with them, letting them see that you’re proactive and care about your career. Capture your key accomplishments and send them ahead to your boss to jog their memory and avoid recency bias, suggests executive coach Rebecca Zucker.</p> 
<h2>Own your mistakes.</h2> 
<p>In contrast to being blindsided after the fact by negative feedback, taking control of your situation by admitting errors and planning how you will improve your areas of risk is likely to result in respect from your manager and team. Accepting and owning any missteps or weaknesses can help you and your manager shift from looking backward to looking ahead. Barnard-Bahn suggests using the following language with your manager in owning a mistake, tailoring it to your situation: “In case you’re not aware, I had a negative encounter with one of our major clients, and I want to own up to it and tell you what I plan to do about it.”</p> 
<p>Once you’ve fessed up to your boss about the dropped ball, create a detailed action plan that may involve creating a timeline, reprioritizing your tasks, learning new skills, and/or reexamining how you come across to colleagues. Share your development plan with your manager and ask for the support you need to improve, such as removing organizational constraints, counsels Zucker.</p> 
<h2>Follow up.</h2> 
<p>Once you’ve committed to your action plan and gained buy-in for it, set a date with your manager for a follow-up meeting in three months to make sure you’re making the needed improvements. Chhaya emphasizes that the clearer you are on what went wrong, your responsibility in the matter, and what you will do to improve in the future, the easier it will be to take the feedback with grace and ease. It will also help you potentially transform a pending negative review into a positive one down the road.</p> 
<h2>Demonstrate that you care about doing better</h2> 
<p>According to Barnard-Bahn, “showing that you care” is a top reason separating employees are retained after messing up. “Backbone combined with humility are the qualities leaders look for in their direct reports,” she says — you need the backbone to withstand the criticism you’re likely to endure after a failure and the humility to admit you made a mistake.</p> 
<h3>. . .</h3> 
<p>At the end of the day, it’s important to look at the big picture.<strong> </strong>Sometimes <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/what-to-do-after-a-bad-performance-review">lagging performance</a> isn’t a result of a blind spot but an indication that you’re in the wrong position. If you still receive a negative review despite your best efforts to be proactive, it may help you realize that your skills, strengths, and interests don’t align with the needs of your current role. Use the setback as a springboard for change — and take this chance to re-evaluate your career.</p>
