		<p><span>Caches help reduce latency, scale read-heavy workloads, and save cost. They are literally everywhere. Caches run on your phone and in your browser. For example, CDNs and DNS are essentially geo-replicated caches. It’s thanks to many caches working behind the scenes that you can read this blog post right now.</span></p>
<p><span>Phil Karlton famously said, “There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.” If you have ever worked on a cache that uses invalidations, chances are you have run into the annoying problem of cache inconsistency.</span></p>
<p><span>At Meta, we operate some of the largest cache deployments in the world, including</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2013/06/25/core-data/tao-the-power-of-the-graph/"><span>TAO</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/scaling-memcache-at-facebook/"> <span>Memcache</span></a><span>. Over the years, we’ve improved TAO’s cache consistency by one measure, from 99.9999 percent (six nines) to 99.99999999 percent (10 nines). </span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to cache invalidation, we believe we now have an effective solution to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The principle and methodology in this blog post apply broadly to most, if not all, cache services at any scale. It does so whether you are caching Postgres data in Redis or maintaining a disaggregated materialization.</span></p>
<p><span>We want to help reduce the number of cache invalidation issues that engineers have to deal with and help make all caches with invalidations more consistent.</span></p>

<h2><span>Defining cache invalidation and cache consistency </span></h2>
<p><span>By definition, a cache doesn’t hold the source of truth of your data (e.g., a database). Cache invalidation describes the process of actively invalidating stale cache entries when data in the source of truth mutates. If a cache invalidation gets mishandled, it can indefinitely leave inconsistent values in the cache that are different from what’s in the source of truth.</span></p>
<p><span>Cache invalidation involves an action that has to be carried out by something other than the cache itself. Something (e.g., a client or a pub/sub system) needs to tell the cache that a mutation happened. A cache that solely depends on time to live (TTL) to maintain its freshness contains no cache invalidations and, as such, lies out of scope for this discussion. For the rest of this post, we’ll assume the presence of cache invalidation.</span></p>
<p><span>Why is this seemingly straightforward process considered such a difficult problem in computer science? Here’s a simple example of how a cache inconsistency could be introduced: </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png?w=1024" alt="cache invalidations" width="1024" height="320" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png?resize=916,286 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png?resize=768,240 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png?resize=1024,320 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png?resize=1536,479 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png?resize=96,30 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-1.png?resize=192,60 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"/></p>
<p><span>The cache first tries to fill </span><i><span>x</span></i><span> from the database. But before the reply “x=42” reaches the cache host, someone mutates </span><i><span>x</span></i><span> to 43. The cache invalidation event for “x=43” arrives at the cache host first, setting </span><i><span>x</span></i><span> to 43. Finally, “x=42” in the cache fill reply gets to the cache, setting </span><i><span>x</span></i><span> to 42. Now we have “x=43” in the database and “x=42” in the cache indefinitely. </span></p>
<p><span>There are different ways to solve this problem, one of which involves maintaining a version field. This allows us to perform conflict resolution, as older data should never overwrite newer data. But what if the cache entry “x=43 @version=2” gets evicted from cache before “x=42” arrives? In that case, the cache host would lose knowledge of the newer data.</span></p>
<p><span>The challenge of cache invalidation arises not only from the complexity of invalidation protocols, but also from monitoring cache consistency and determining why these cache inconsistencies occur. Designing a consistent cache is very different from operating a consistent cache — much like designing</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/03/07/core-data/augmenting-flexible-paxos-logdevice/"> <span>Paxos</span></a><span>, where the protocol is different from building Paxos that actually works in production.</span></p>
<h2><span>Why do we care about cache consistency at all?</span></h2>
<p><span>Do we have to solve this intricate cache invalidation problem? Yes. In some cases, cache inconsistencies are almost as bad as data loss on a database. From the user’s perspective, it can even be indistinguishable from data loss.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s examine another example of how cache inconsistencies can lead to split-brain. A messaging use case at Meta stores its mapping from user to primary storage in</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2013/06/25/core-data/tao-the-power-of-the-graph/"> <span>TAO</span></a><span>. It performs shuffling frequently to keep the user’s primary message storage close to where the user accesses Meta. Every time you send a message to someone, behind the scenes, the system queries TAO to find out where to store the message. Many years ago, when TAO was less consistent, some TAO replicas would have inconsistent data after reshuffling, as illustrated in the example below.</span></p>
<p><span>Imagine that after shuffling Alice’s primary message store from region 2 to region 1, two people, Bob and Mary, both sent messages to Alice. When Bob sent a message to Alice, the system queried the TAO replica in a region close to where Bob lives and sent the message to region 1. When Mary sent a message to Alice, it queried the TAO replica in a region close to where Mary lives, hit the inconsistent TAO replica, and sent the message to region 2. Mary and Bob sent their messages to different regions, and neither region/store had a complete copy of Alice’s messages. </span></p>

<h2><span>A mental model of cache invalidation</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-3.png?w=1024" alt="cache invalidations" width="1024" height="429" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-3.png 1414w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-3.png?resize=916,384 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-3.png?resize=768,322 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-3.png?resize=1024,429 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-3.png?resize=96,40 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-3.png?resize=192,80 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"/></p>
<p><span>Understanding the unique challenges of cache invalidation is particularly challenging. Let’s start with a simple mental model. A cache, at its very core, is a stateful service that stores data in an addressable storage medium. Distributed systems are essentially state machines. If every state transition is performed correctly, we will have a distributed system that works as expected. Otherwise, we’ll have a problem. So, the key question is: What’s changing the data for a stateful service? </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png?w=1024" alt="cache invalidations" width="1024" height="503" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png?resize=916,450 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png?resize=768,377 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png?resize=1024,503 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png?resize=1536,754 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png?resize=96,47 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-4.png?resize=192,94 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"/></p>
<p><span>A static cache has a very simple cache model (e.g., a simplified CDN fits this model). Data is immutable. No cache invalidations. For databases, data gets mutated only on writes (or replications). We often have logs for almost every state change for a database. Whenever an anomaly occurs, the logs can help us understand what happened, narrow down the problem, and identify the issue. Building a fault-tolerant distributed database (which is already difficult) comes with its own set of unique challenges. These are just simplified mental models. We do not intend to minimize anyone’s struggles. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png?w=1024" alt="cache invalidations" width="1024" height="592" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png?resize=916,529 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png?resize=768,444 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png?resize=1024,592 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png?resize=1536,887 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png?resize=96,55 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-5.png?resize=192,111 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"/></p>
<p><span>For a dynamic cache, like </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc13/atc13-bronson.pdf"><span>TAO</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/scaling-memcache-at-facebook/"> <span>Memcache</span></a><span>, data gets mutated on both read (cache fill) and write (cache invalidation) paths. This exact conjunction makes many race conditions possible and cache invalidation a difficult problem. Data in cache is not durable, which means that sometimes version information that is important for conflict resolution can get evicted. In combining all these characteristics, a dynamic cache produces race conditions beyond your wildest imagination.</span></p>
<p><span>And it’s almost impractical to log and trace every cache state change. A cache often gets introduced to scale a read-heavy workload. It implies that most of the cache state changes transpire from the cache fill path. Take TAO, for example. It serves more than one quadrillion queries a day. Even if the cache hit rate reaches 99 percent, we would be doing more than 10 trillion cache fills a day. Logging and tracing all the cache state changes would turn a read-heavy cache workload to an extremely write-heavy workload for the logging system. Debugging a distributed system already presents significant challenges. Debugging a distributed system — in this case, a distributed cache — without logs or traces for cache state changes could be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite these challenges, we improved TAO’s cache consistency, by one measure, from 99.9999 to 99.99999999 over the years. In the rest of the post, we will explain how we did it and highlight some future work. </span></p>
<h2><span>Reliable consistency observability</span></h2>
<p><span>To solve cache invalidation and cache consistency, the first step involves measurement. We want to measure cache consistency and sound an alarm when there are inconsistent entries in the cache. The measurement can’t contain any false positives. Human brains can easily tune out noises. If any false positives existed, people would quickly learn to ignore it and the metric would lose trust and become useless. We also need the measurement to be precise, as we talk about measuring up to more than 10 nines of consistency. If a consistency fix is landed, we want to assure we can quantitatively measure its improvement. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png?w=1024" alt="cache invalidations" width="1024" height="566" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png 1999w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png?resize=916,506 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png?resize=1024,566 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png?resize=1536,848 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png?resize=96,53 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-6.png?resize=192,106 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"/></p>
<p><span>To solve the measurement problem, we built a service called Polaris. For any anomaly in a stateful service, it is an anomaly only if clients can observe it one way or the other. Otherwise, we argue that it doesn’t matter at all. Based on this principle, Polaris focuses on measuring the violations of client-observable invariants.</span></p>
<p><span>At a high level, Polaris interacts with a stateful service as a client and assumes no knowledge of the service internals. This allows it to be generic. We have dozens of Polaris integrations at Meta. “Cache should eventually be consistent with the database” is a typical client-observable invariant that Polaris monitors, especially in the presence of asynchronous cache invalidation. In this case, Polaris pretends to be a cache server and receives cache invalidation events. For example, if Polaris receives an invalidation event that says “x=4 @version 4,” it then queries all cache replicas as a client to verify whether any violations of the invariant occur. If one cache replica returns “x=3 @version 3,” Polaris flags it as inconsistent and requeues the sample to later check it against the same target cache host. Polaris reports inconsistencies at certain timescales, e.g., one minute, five minutes or 10 minutes. If this sample still shows as inconsistent after one minute, Polaris reports it as an inconsistency for the corresponding timescale.</span></p>
<p><span>This multi-timescale design not only allows Polaris to have multiple queues internally to implement backoff and retries efficiently, but it’s also essential for preventing it from producing false positives.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s take a look at a more interesting example: Say Polaris receives an invalidation with “x=4 @version 4.” But when it queries a cache replica, it gets a reply saying </span><i><span>x</span></i><span> doesn’t exist. It’s not clear whether Polaris should flag this as an inconsistency. It’s possible that </span><i><span>x</span></i><span> was invisible at version 3, the version 4 write is the latest write on the key, and it’s indeed a cache inconsistency. It’s also possible that there’s a version 5 write that deletes the key </span><i><span>x</span></i><span>, and perhaps Polaris is just seeing a more recent view of the data than what’s in the invalidation event.</span></p>
<p><span>To disambiguate between these two cases, we would need to bypass cache and check what’s in the database. Queries that bypass cache are very compute-intensive. They also expose the database to risks — not surprisingly because protecting the database and scaling a read-heavy workload is one of the most common use cases for caches. So, we can’t send too many queries to the system that bypasses the cache. Polaris solves this problem by delaying performing the compute-intensive operation until an inconsistent sample crosses the reporting timescale (e.g., one minute or five minutes). Real cache inconsistencies and racing write operations on the same key are rare. As a result, retrying the consistency check (before it crosses the next timescale boundary) helps remove most of the demand to perform these cache bypass queries.</span></p>
<p><span>We also added a special flag to the query that Polaris sends to the cache server. So, in the reply, Polaris would know whether the target cache server has seen and processed the cache invalidation event. This bit of information enables Polaris to distinguish between transient cache inconsistencies (usually caused by replication/invalidation lag) and “permanent” cache inconsistencies — when a stale value is in cache indefinitely after processing the latest invalidation event. </span></p>
<p><span>Polaris produces a metric that looks like “N nines of cache writes are consistent in M minutes.” At the beginning of the post, we mentioned that by one measure we improved TAO’s cache consistency from 99.9999 percent to 99.99999999 percent. Polaris provided these numbers for the five minute timescale. In other words, 99.99999999 percent of cache writes are consistent within five minutes. Less than 1 out of 10 billion cache writes would be inconsistent in TAO after five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>We deploy Polaris as a separate service so that it will scale independently from the production service and its workload. If we want to measure up to more nines, we can just increase Polaris throughput or perform aggregation over a longer time window. </span></p>
<h2><span>Consistency tracing</span></h2>
<p><span>In most diagrams, we use one simple box to represent cache. In reality, it looks more like the following, even after omitting many dependencies and data flows: </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png?w=1024" alt="cache invalidations" width="1024" height="557" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png 1740w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png?resize=916,498 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png?resize=768,418 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png?resize=1024,557 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png?resize=1536,835 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png?resize=96,52 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cache-made-consisent-image-7.png?resize=192,104 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"/></p>
<p><span>Caches can fill from different upstreams at different points in time, within or across regions. Promotions, shard moves, failure recoveries, network partitions, and hardware failures can all potentially trigger bugs that lead to cache inconsistencies. </span></p>
<p><span>However, as mentioned earlier, logging and tracing every cache data change is almost impractical. But what if we only log and trace cache mutations where and when cache inconsistencies can get introduced (or cache invalidations can possibly be mishandled)? Within this massive and complex distributed system, where a single flaw in any component can lead to cache inconsistencies, is it possible to find a place where most if not all cache inconsistencies get introduced? </span></p>
<p><span>Our task becomes finding a simple solution to help us manage this complexity. We want to assess the entire cache consistency problem from a single cache server’s perspective. At the end of the day, an inconsistency has to materialize on a cache server. From its perspective, it cares about only a few aspects:</span><span><br/>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Did it receive the invalidate?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Did it process the invalidate correctly?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Did the item become inconsistent afterwards? </span></li>

<p><span>This is the same example we explained at the beginning of the post, now illustrated on a space-time diagram. If we focus on the cache host timeline at the bottom, we see that after a client write, there’s a window in which both the invalidation and the cache fill can race to update the cache. After a while, the cache will be in a quiescent state. Cache fills can still happen in high volume in this state, but from a consistency perspective, it holds less interest, given there are no writes and it’s reduced to a static cache. </span></p>
<p><span>We built a stateful tracing library that logs and traces cache mutations in this small purple window, where all the interesting and complicated interactions trigger bugs that lead to cache inconsistencies. It covers cache evictions, and even the absence of the log can tell us if the invalidate event never arrives. It’s embedded into a few major cache services and throughout the invalidation pipeline. It buffers an index of recently modified data, used to determine whether subsequent cache state changes should be logged. And it supports code tracing, so we’ll know the exact code path for every traced query. </span></p>
<p><span>This methodology has helped us find and fix many flaws. It offers a systemic and much more scalable approach to diagnosing cache inconsistencies. It has proved to be very effective. </span></p>

<p><span>In one system, we version each piece of data for ordering and conflict resolution. In this case, we observed “metadata=0 @version 4” in the cache, while the database contained “metadata=1 @version 4.” The cache stayed inconsistent indefinitely. This state should have been impossible. Pause for a second and consider: How would you approach this problem? How nice would it be if we got the complete timeline of every single step that led to the final inconsistent state?</span></p>
<p><span>Consistency tracing provided exactly the timeline we needed. </span></p>

<p><span>In the system, a very rare operation updates two tables of the underlying database transactionally — the metadata table and the version table. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Based on consistency tracing, we know the following happened:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The cache tried to fill the metadata with version.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span> </span><span>In the first round, the cache first filled the old metadata.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Next, a write transaction updated both the metadata table and the version table atomically.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In the second round, the cache filled the new version data. Here, the cache fill operation interleaved with the database transaction. It happens very rarely because the racing window is tiny. You might be thinking, “This is the bug.”. No. Actually, so far everything worked as expected because cache invalidation is supposed to bring the cache to a consistent state.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Later, cache invalidation came during an attempt to update the cache entry to both the new metadata and the new version. This almost always works, but this time it didn’t. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The cache invalidation ran into a rare transient error on the cache host, which triggered the error handling code.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The error handler dropped the item in cache. The pseudocode looks like this:</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>drop_cache(key, version);</code></pre>
<p><span>It says drop the item in cache, if its version is less than specified. However, the inconsistent cache item contained the latest version. So this code did nothing, leaving stale metadata in cache indefinitely. This is the bug. We simplified the example quite a bit here. The actual bug has even more intricacy, with database replication and cross region communication involved. The bug gets triggered only when all steps above occur and happen specifically in this sequence. The inconsistency gets triggered very rarely. The bug hides in the error handling code behind interleaving operations and transient errors. </span></p>
<p><span>Many years ago, finding the root cause of such a bug would take weeks from someone who knew the code and the service inside out, if they were lucky enough to find it at all. In this case, Polaris identified the anomaly and fired an alarm immediately. With information from consistency tracing, it took on-call engineers less than 30 minutes to locate the bug. </span></p>
<h2><span>Future cache consistency work</span></h2>
<p><span>We’ve shared how we made our caches more consistent with a generic, systemic, and scalable approach. Looking ahead, we want to get the consistency of all our caches as close to 100 percent as physically possible. Consistency for disaggregated secondary indices poses an interesting challenge. We are also measuring and meaningfully improving cache consistency at read time. Finally, we are building a high-level consistency API for distributed systems — think of C++’s std::memory_order, but for distributed systems.</span></p>

    8th February 2023 
  </span></p><p>It’s hardly insightful to suggest that the last few years have substantially changed the day to day experience of a knowledge worker. Nearly overnight even the most remote skeptical leadership teams were forced to embrace flexible work practices like working from home.</p>

<p>But now, despite COVID-19 being a ongoing health risk for many, a non trivial number of companies are pushing employees back into the office. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-10/musk-s-first-email-to-twitter-staff-ends-remote-work">Almost</a> no tech company has gone as far as mandating five days a week in the office, but <a href="https://tech.co/news/tim-cook-apple-return-office-mandate">many</a> are mandating some number of days where employees <strong>must</strong> be in the office. They suggest, with little objective evidence, that “in-person collaboration is essential”. Never mind that there is <a href="https://futureforum.com/research/">ample evidence</a>, including our own lived experiences, to suggest that remote work is not only possible, but can be more productive and more inclusive.</p>

<h2 id="remote-isnt-perfect-but-it-is-table-stakes">Remote isn’t perfect, but it is table stakes</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong here, I’m not saying that remote work, or even hybrid works for everyone. Personally, I live near Intercom HQ and actually <strong>enjoy</strong> going into the office. I love jumping into a meeting room and whiteboarding an idea with a teammate. But crucially, how much time I spend in the office is <strong>my choice</strong>.</p>

<p>But there seems to be this returning perspective in the tech industry that remote work isn’t a fairly standard work practice, but is instead something that is a gift to employees. A privilege to be earned. A perk to bestow upon the most deserving.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-normal-to-be-embraced">A new normal to be embraced</h2>

<p>Unless I missed a trick, the tech industry didn’t disintegrate over the last few years with everything grinding to a halt. Software still got shipped, deals still got closed, customers still got supported.</p>

<p>Was it an adjustment? For sure. Did we adapt? Absolutely. Arguably, we thrived. Companies suddenly had access to a talent pool that was always there, but they were ignorant of. No longer did they have to limit themselves to people who lived near the office, or have to offer hefty relocation packages. Real estate expenses fell through the floor.</p>

<p>Looking at benefits like that, it boggles my mind that companies are pushing back on remote work, or otherwise gatekeeping it behind requirements like the whims of a manager, the results of your last performance review, or a predetermined number of days in the office.</p>

<p>Just consider how ludicrous something like requiring an employee to have had their last two performance reviews meet some criteria. On paper, you could see the logic. They’re underperforming and might need extra attention to get them up to the bar. But if you scratch the surface, it doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Imagine if their manager works remotely, what difference will it make to their performance if they’re going into an office that their manager isn’t even in?</p>

<h2 id="embrace-the-flexibility-leave-the-past-behind">Embrace the flexibility, leave the past behind</h2>

<p>There was a time when every tech employee had a desktop computer. We could only do work when physically sat at our desks. But as laptops became more powerful and more affordable, it became a defacto standard, and people were suddenly unshackled from their desks. We could work from anywhere in the office. And people did. Office layouts adjusted to include breakout areas, little nooks and crannies where people could work. The idea of only having a desktop computer now seems quaint at best, and a bit of a warning flag at worst.</p>

<p>All we need to do now is for people who are stuck with a “office first” mindset to carry that logic to its natural conclusion - <em>It doesn’t matter where you work, as long as you get the work done.</em></p>

            <p><span>On March 12, 1955,</span> Charlie Parker collapsed in the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter’s Upper East Side apartment after a three-day booze binge. The improviser of superhuman poise was dead at thirty-four, eliciting solemn observance from musicians and fans, particularly those who’d been hanging around Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem where, in the early 1940s, a new kind of music called bebop had been invented. “Bird has disintegrated into pure sound!” is said to have been overheard somewhere near the Five Spot on Cooper Square, the Beat tavern where much bad poetry was recited, and where some great musicians nightly turned the style that came out of Harlem into ever more febrile and kinked contortions. Part of the Bird enigma was the impossible fusion of musical angel and reptilian addict, a miraculously graceful artist who might steal your horn and pawn it for smack.</p>
<p>Four months after Bird’s death, his one-time personal assistant Miles Davis seduced everyone at the Newport Jazz Festival, performing a tune called “<a href="https://youtu.be/iWC5wBXyozM">Round Midnight</a>,” written by someone who had been part of the Minton’s scene but was still an underground figure: Thelonious Monk, who had only a handful of records under his belt and, then approaching forty, was still playing on other people’s dates. Indeed, he was the pianist behind Miles for the Newport performance, which would help the younger musician sign with Columbia records, putting him on the road to stardom. An oft-told anecdote has the two sharing a car back to New York. “You weren’t playing the tune right,” Monk says, to which Miles replies that he is just jealous, at which point Monk orders the car to pull over and takes the ferry to the city alone.</p>
<p>The Newport set came about midway through Monk’s career, which was long by the standards of jazz. Over three decades he played on more than a hundred records, collaborating with artists as different as Sonny Rollins and Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane and Clark Terry, Art Blakey and Oliver Nelson. From the first, he was revered by fellow musicians, even those who would later do away with harmony and structure, aspiring toward a kind of “free” jazz. “Of all the bop greats Monk’s influence seems second now only to that of Charlie Parker,” Amiri Baraka wrote in 1967. Monk was also a committed teacher, including to Rollins and Coltrane, who both spent mornings practicing at his tiny apartment on West Sixty-Third.</p>
<p>Commercial success, however, had a way of eluding Monk. His career began with sporadic recordings on the Blue Note and Prestige labels, made through the 1940s and 1950s, none of which sold well. Already struggling to support his family, his financial troubles worsened in 1951 when he was arrested—with his friend, the great bebop pianist Bud Powell—on drug charges and was left without his cabaret card for a half dozen years, preventing him from playing in nightclubs. Switching to the Riverside label in 1955, he found new momentum but only reached a wide public in 1962, when he was signed by Columbia records, joining a roster that included Miles Davis and Charles Mingus. After that, his profile dramatically grew; two years later he even appeared on the cover of <em>Time</em>. By his death in 1982, he had become a respectable pillar of the music’s evolution, as seen in Ken Burns’s 2001 PBS documentary <em>Jazz</em>. But neither a cult reputation as a pioneer of bebop nor American canonization quite does justice to Monk, who was simply one of the most imaginative composers of the twentieth century, a judgment that in my view does not require the qualifiers “jazz” or “American.”</p>
<p>What made Monk a great composer was his way of putting a tune together, and the stamp he put on pianism—his unique approach to chord voicing, phrasing and accent—was inseparable from his being a great thinker in song form. Like his hero Duke Ellington, he had a gift for reconciling musical experiment with the immediacy of pop, finding freedom in the constraints of a verse-chorus-bridge grammar that might otherwise default to clichés. Inventing a set of private aesthetic laws, he worked out their possibilities over the course of his career with admirable stubbornness and conviction. If the axioms were laid down at Blue Note (1947–1952), revised here and there at Prestige (1952–1954), the Riverside years (1955–1961), which I’ll zoom in on in what follows, showed what kinds of proofs could be argued from them.</p>
<h3>Record Changer</h3>
<p>Monk was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in 1917 in a home where he might have heard some live music: his father could bang out ragtime on the piano as well as play harmonica, as Robin Kelly notes in his staggeringly thorough biography, <em>Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</em> (2010)—from which this essay draws most of its factual information. The family relocated to New York City in 1922, moving into Phipps housing in the San Juan Hill neighborhood at West Sixty-Third Street where, at age six, Monk began taking piano lessons from a neighbor. Jazz was then dominated by swing bands like Duke’s, Count Basie’s, and Fletcher Henderson’s, and star soloists like Lester Young, Ben Webster, Louis Armstrong, and Benny Goodman. Piano was the stride style of James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, with Art Tatum at its dazzling apex. It was from that kind of playing that Monk developed a serious interest in the instrument. Dropping out of Stuyvesant High (where he had excelled in math), he honed his chops on the road, playing with a traveling evangelist for two years.</p>
<blockquote><p>He had a gift for reconciling musical experiment with the immediacy of pop.</p></blockquote>
<p>How and when began the private alchemy by which the stride style was given a modernist acid bath would be hard to pinpoint. By the time he was sitting in with Coleman Hawkins in 1944, however, Monk was comping so off the grid that musicians were squinting their eyes at him. It is sometimes said that he helped “invent” bebop, which is true to the extent that he played at Minton’s in the early 1940s with several of the genre’s pioneers—Parker, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, drummer Kenny Clarke—and insofar as his playing mostly broke with swing-era mannerisms. But the differences between him and other bebop virtuosos are more striking than the continuities. For all their blistering speed and invention, the likes of Bud, Bird, and Diz tended not to sing, rather letting their formidable chops do the talking. By contrast, Monk built up ideas from material implicit in the tune, always soloing with the melody in mind. This comes through vividly in his takes on standards like “<a href="https://youtu.be/CcEK8hP1frU">Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</a>,” or “<a href="https://youtu.be/3zRuMflW-30">Everything Happens to Me</a>,” or “<a href="https://youtu.be/T_lsD5g7mAY">I’ve Got It Bad</a>,” where each chord seems deliberated over, as if Monk is pausing to choose an expressive coloring that will best convey the melody.</p>
<p>At the same time, Monk had an original sound marked by angular phrasing, atypical chord voicings, and his beloved Tatum-ish glissandos. But it was also his tone, odd as that sounds in the case of an instrument as fixed in its design as the piano. Fingers rigidly horizontal over the keys, he played with both a bell-like purity and a harsh, percussive attack. Many initially heard sloppiness, mistakes, even incompetence. (Philip Larkin later called him an “elephant at the keyboard.”) Like the philistine who asserts that Dylan “can’t sing,” hearing Monk as a “bad” pianist misses something so fundamental you don’t know where to begin.</p>
<p>The early reception of Monk’s music was usually accompanied, and occasionally overshadowed, by his public image as a “weirdo.” Clichés repurposed by journalists (“The High Priest of Bop”), his own sartorial affectations (bamboo framed glasses, berets, and then more exotic head gear), and a brusque, at times irritable style of communication as a bandleader (when the twenty-two-year-old Sahib Shihab looked at the jagged melody of “<a href="https://youtu.be/xG-wHvGWvws">Who Knows</a>” during a 1947 session and said it was too difficult, Monk replied: “You a musician? You got a union card? Play it.”)—all this blurred into an aura of mere eccentricity, otherworldly disconnection from reality, becoming a form of kitsch. The myth was reinforced by Monk’s propensity for Zen-like aphorisms about musical aesthetics, such as the claim that the “inside of the tune is the part that makes the outside sound good.” By this he seems to have meant that the B section (the inside) casts back over the A section, revealing the song’s shape as it unfolds in time. Think of not knowing that a tunnel fans out and widens (until you get there) or of journeying through a circle and slowly discovering it is a sphere. Another Monkism was the importance of swinging at slow tempos, which made the push against the metronome more stretched and exaggerated, and so more expressive, maybe even more musical.</p>
<p>After a piece in <em>Down Beat</em> about the “Genius of Bop” caught the attention of the Blue Note label’s cofounder Alfred Lion, he and his wife Lorraine Gordon were invited (by its author William Gottlieb) over to Monk’s apartment, where they sat with their feet up on the bed while he played with his back to them. He was soon offered a contract with Blue Note, on which he recorded multiple dates—first in 1947, again in the early 1950s—of mostly original material, all of which would come out as <em>The Genius of Modern Music Volume 1</em> and <em>2</em> in 1951 and 1952. “<a href="https://youtu.be/s-d0ULekFFc">Criss Cross</a>,” an up-tempo, asymmetric tune from those first dates, is a good example of his compositional approach. The opening section is studded with obstacles, specifically an eighth rest and a quarter rest on either side of an A in the third measure, which throws off what the ear expects as the completion of the phrase. (For some reason, on a later recording of the tune for the Columbia LP <em>Criss Cross</em>, he removed that first rest, giving it a much straighter feel.) That section is then contrasted with a second idea, chromatically descending tones ping-ponging against a repeated G, a figure which, doubled in unison with Milt Jackson’s vibraphone, sounds like someone laughing.</p>
<p>The jazz historian and composer Gunther Schuller thought “Criss Cross” was exemplary of Monk’s musical language, calling it an abstract idea. That seems right enough, though Schuller also insisted that “Criss Cross” wasn’t technically a “song,” which is wrong. The Stravinsky-like placement of rests to create off-kilter accents, broken phrasing that works against the bar lines, and the general feeling of music assembled as if it were a Calder mobile—none of this prevents “Criss Cross” from coming off with the fizz of a pop single. And the same is true of other ostensibly “abstract” pieces from <em>The Genius of Modern Music</em>, like “<a href="https://youtu.be/NYj61DQzaQs">Off Minor</a>,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/yFn0pdpS_jY">Evidence</a>,” or “<a href="https://youtu.be/3_81Wv_hK-c">Misterioso</a>,” with its staggered major 6s rising and falling like a Slinky. These tunes are arresting not for their virtuosity but for their architecture and shape—how their inside expresses the outside and vice versa, to use Monk’s wonderfully accurate analogy. And this is not to mention ballads like “<a href="https://youtu.be/IrAfjW5qiyo">Round Midnight</a>,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/i2LBuj4GYtQ">Ask Me Now</a>,” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/u1O9YuXNbLs">Ruby, My Dear</a>,” which Ira Gitler described in his liner notes as conveying “sentiment without sentimentality.”</p>
<p>After the Blue Note records sold dismally, Monk moved in 1952 to Bob Weinstock’s Prestige records for a three-year contract, rearranging and rerecording a batch of songs he’d been playing for years. The obviously out-of-tune piano on the first Prestige disc ought to give a sense of the recording budget for these dates. One of them, plagued with mishaps and misunderstandings, features a take of “<a href="https://youtu.be/NxYlhw0A0wo">Friday the 13th</a>” that needed to be coached into overtime from the control room, chugging on over its gloomy riff for ten and a half minutes. Though sales were again not great, musicians were starting to pay attention, as was Orrin Keepnews—an industrious Columbia undergraduate who helped edit the jazz newsletter <em>The Record Changer</em> and had befriended Monk years earlier. Keepnews eventually lent Monk the $108 and change to get Prestige to end the contract and signed him to his own new venture, Riverside Records.</p>
<p>The suggestion that Monk devote his Riverside debut to a set of Duke Ellington tunes was Keepnews’s idea. It stemmed from his sense, as he put it in the notes for the sleeve of <em>Thelonious Monk Plays the Music of Duke Ellington</em> (1956), that it might be “helpful to know the precise structural and melodic starting point of a musician’s improvisations.” In other words, why not apply Monk’s slightly bent melodic imagination to songs everybody already knows? It proved to be an inspired idea. Right out of the gate, “<a href="https://youtu.be/0pU-5pEpfmE">It Don’t Mean A Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)</a>” merges Monk’s world with Duke’s, its stuttering, telegraphic one-note intro an apparent echo of “Thelonious” from the Blue Note sessions. On “<a href="https://youtu.be/dT-9-pkdzlI">Solitude</a>,” he finds piano shades that seem to get at Duke’s orchestrations, along with a wide-open stride style swinging under the right-hand melodies. Throughout, he takes up the material in an easy, graceful, somehow fundamentally singing approach. The same could be said for the covers on the second Riverside release, <em>The Unique Thelonious Monk</em> (1956), on which, to take one example, <a href="https://youtu.be/Xw9KzKJJjPs">Eubie Blake’s “Memories of You”</a> is <a href="https://youtu.be/BOJ1dfuvWqU">given</a> a halting half-stride solo treatment that feels both warm and anxious.</p>
<p>The third Riverside LP leaves the world of cover versions for original compositions arranged for a band that included Sonny Rollins and Max Roach. Kelley describes how the musicians had a tough time getting a good take of the title track, “<a href="https://youtu.be/AwlbjCzO9KU">Brilliant Corners</a>,” because of its huge intervallic leaps and tempo shifts. Steadfast in his conviction that music should be learned by ear, Monk would not share the charts, which exacerbated the problem. Left with twenty-five takes and no master, Keepnews cut them together with a razor blade for the version that’s on the record, a feat of studio wonkery rare for the period, especially in jazz. The album’s other masterpiece, “<a href="https://youtu.be/9fkmrkmoJHs">Pannonica</a>,” was named for Monk’s close friend and sometime caretaker, financial backer, and nurse—the Baroness in whose apartment Bird had died. It is a good example of “swinging at slow tempo,” its tipsy melody turning around like a revolving oval. There happened to be a celeste in the Reeves studio that day, prompting Monk to use it for the first go round on “Pannonica,” which adds a plunky lullaby sheen to the arrangement.</p>
<h3>Played Twice</h3>
<p>Whitney Balliett, who wrote about jazz for <em>The New Yorker</em> for almost fifty years, said of Monk that “his improvisations were molten Monk compositions and his compositions were frozen Monk improvisations.” A particularly extravagant instance of that thought is the outtake of “<a href="https://youtu.be/cUmPKG3jvP8">Round Midnight</a>,” recorded as part of the <em>Thelonious Himself</em> (1957) sessions and included on the <em>Complete Monk on Riverside</em> (1986) box set. Over the course of a glorious, open, twenty-two-minute take, Monk comes at the tune’s ideas from different angles, circling back elliptically to repeat whole sections, playing phrases out of order, like he’s turning an object around slowly and letting the light hit it in different spots. One begins to think of the track less as a discrete composition and more as an atmosphere, a distributed range of musical possibilities organized around the incomparable melody, which holds the pieces together like a recurring dream.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fingers rigidly horizontal over the piano keys, he played with both a bell-like purity and a harsh, percussive attack.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a good deal of gigging at the time, and Keepnews was conscientious about hauling mics around for possible releases. Sometimes live settings can bring out Monk’s rhythmic extremism more vividly than on record, as with a version of “<a href="https://youtu.be/_0Fq0kXAvrI">Evidence</a>,” recorded at the Five Spot in the summer of 1958. By treating the subdivisions of the bar as a kind of random number generator—playing on the <em>and</em> of 1, then on the 1 of the <em>next</em> bar, then the <em>and</em> of 3, then on 2 and so on—Monk creates an effect almost of meterlessness, a pointillist articulation at once spacey and tense, concluding on an F7 figure that, with its comically pasted-on feeling, suggests the whole thing is a prank. Of course, it is not a prank, and the tune is anything but meterless. Monk is being excessively careful with time, and the band is fussily counting while somehow swinging extra hard through it all. <em>Misterioso</em>, another Riverside live release, captures the quartet on a different night at the Five Spot that year, with Monk taking a solo on “<a href="https://youtu.be/Z1expiBv73k">Bye-Ya</a>” that turns the melody into a series of splashy clusters.</p>
<p>Monk’s arranging had always suggested that his work might be interestingly set for a big band, an experiment that first happened in composer Hall Overton’s Sixth Avenue loft. These rehearsals initially took place with the two of them seated at a piano, going through the charts and discussing arrangements, after which a ten-piece band was assembled and a concert booked. <em>The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall</em> (1959) reveals a band not always sure of what to do with Monk’s music, but which at times shows what could be done. “<a href="https://youtu.be/REpKq8Tj5sI">Little Rootie Tootie</a>,” features dissonant piano triplets working against bass-trumpet-alto unison lines; contrastive colors that add a new dimension to the earlier Prestige recording of the tune. On that night, he also played through one of his purest abstract compositions, “<a href="https://youtu.be/dyc3R3zlVco">Crespuscule With Nellie</a>,” which is dedicated to his infinitely patient best friend and wife, and somehow conveys the ups and downs of life, the surprises, and jolts, and the recurring tenderness of coming home to a family.</p>
<p>If asked to identify a single tune that best encapsulates Monk’s unique approach to composition, I would consider “<a href="https://youtu.be/wIB87eV4a7s">Played Twice</a>” from <em>5 by Monk by 5</em> (1959). It opens with three whacks on an open hi hat, then a figure enters suggesting the key of Db, followed by the band, which comes in a half step down, in C. Has a key change occurred two seconds in? In fact, it’s less a key change than a melody so strangely shaped it suggests modulation, and which soon moves from that apparent home base of C to a major 7 figure that, playing on another half step (between C and B), again lures us with chromaticism. Yet by the next phrase, a measure later, we’re back to Db! Once the shock wears off, you go look at the chart, which reveals an appealing mirror structure whereby half step chord voicings are reflected in half step moves in the melody, which are in turn somehow also reflected in how one section shifts to the next. It shouldn’t make any sense, but it does. It is also hummable and kind of rocks.</p>
<p>By 1962, Monk was ready to leave Riverside after a buildup of distrust toward Keepnews and some evidence of shady royalty handling and bookkeeping practices. Getting wind of this, a producer at Columbia records, Teo Macero, immediately shot off a note to the label administration, which offered Monk a deal with more money in advances than he’d ever seen. The records got slicker, the stereo more luxuriantly separated, the rooms (like the Thirtieth Street “church” where Glenn Gould’s <em>Goldberg Variations</em> and <em>West Side Story</em>, among others, were recorded) richer and bigger. The sound capture of the piano on the Columbia dates is like a gleaming Cadillac—and to overextend the analogy, on Riverside it’s a Honda Prelude, on Prestige a jalopy, and on Blue Note a Model-T (in good condition). But those fat advances have to be paid back, which necessitated some “hit-making.” It is likely that the financial pressure led to wrongheaded strategies, including some truly dismal canned “rock” composed by Macero.</p>
<p>A late Columbia studio LP <em>Underground</em> featured a cover depicting Monk sequestered in a bunker among strangely militarized paraphernalia—hand grenades, an automatic rifle, a Nazi officer held as prisoner, a TNT detonator of the sort Wile E. Coyote might order from the Acme Corporation—as well as a cow, empty wine and whiskey bottles, and “Vive la France” painted on the wall. The whole thing is super-confused, as if Columbia thought airbrushed Black power optics might be combined with a reboot of the “weirdo” brand to jump start sales. In any case, Monk did not fulfill the Columbia contract, as his occasional spells of bipolar catatonia, for which he had been misdiagnosed (first Thorazine for “depression” then electroshock for “schizophrenia”) gradually ceased to be episodes, becoming a general state of withdrawal. He slid deeper into silence, avoiding the piano, spending most of his time in New Jersey at the Baroness Pannonica’s house with her and her hundreds of cats. Many mornings he got fully dressed and then spent all day in bed.</p>
<h3>In Monk’s Wake</h3>
<p>A mark of Monk’s originality is the way others have found ways to elaborate upon it. Steve Lacy, Don Pullen, Anthony Braxton, and Abdullah Ibrahim, to name a few, all cut Monk records that are also extensions of their own aesthetic. Distinguished pianists from the next generation—Stanley Cowell, Marcus Roberts, and Gonzalo Rubalcaba come to mind—have taken up his quirks of keyboard phrasing in a sense perhaps comparable to the way Monk mashed up Johnson and Waller and Tatum. Terry Adams of NRBQ made a record of Monk covers that shows how amenable his music is to rhythm-and-blues combos of a sort that aren’t too far from rock-and-roll.</p>
<blockquote><p>Taking all the humble nonlinguistic bones of song, he bent them toward his own specific needs and vision.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Monk’s wholly original songwriting is his most lasting legacy. Taking intro, verse, refrain, bridge, coda, and “hook”—all the humble nonlinguistic bones of song—he bent them toward his own specific needs and vision. In this sense, he becomes part of a broader renaissance of American song in the second half of the twentieth century. We think of how Brian Wilson changed the concept of arrangement by approaching the multitrack studio as a set of timbral and dynamic possibilities, of how Dylan made vocal phrasing itself a medium of invention, of Frank Zappa’s whiplash edits between doo-wop and serialism, of Laura Nyro’s run-on sentence melodies, of Joni Mitchell’s way of thinking in open tunings, of Steely Dan spiking FM radio with queasily expanded chords and harmonies—and these last two certainly know their Monk.</p>
<p>If it seems a stretch to treat such examples as Monk-adjacent, that’s because there’s a tendency to think of songs as readymade schemas designed either to deliver a sing-along chorus or to reinforce insipid genre clichés. But a song is an infinitely elastic form. If approached the right way, its rules invite one to be <em>more</em> imaginative, its constraints give one <em>more</em> freedom—an understanding of freedom apparently preferable to Monk, who referred to “free jazz” as “getting rid of structure and simply piling a lot of notes one on top of the other.” While the seventy or so originals Monk wrote and recorded in his lifetime form a planet with its own laws and atmosphere, they are also in constant conversation with a tradition of song as a tightly rule-bound medium. When Monk said simply “jazz is freedom,” he might have been referring to his own strikingly original way of thinking and working in song form.</p>
