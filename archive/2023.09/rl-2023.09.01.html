                  <p><span>It is interesting how much these discussions are focused on the earlier, procreative stages of marriage. ‘Free love’ / freely connecting with people has a certain attraction but what about the commitments later in life? (see: declining health, aging parents…) Such responsibilities feel overwhelming with two sets of parents, it would be hard to imagine more. The flip side of commitment would have less takers i’d imagine</span></p></div></td></tr>

I helped someone&#39;s brother navigate the process of getting a GED and figuring out community college, the group as a whole helped another member kick his alcoholism, and we were there for each other during challenging times. I was only dating one other person in the core group, not everyone else, but it was like having a large extended family that truly had your back, and still is -- even though I&#39;m in a monogamous relationship now, I&#39;m still close to my ex and everyone else in that group. They&#39;re my chosen family<p>I think when practiced mindfully, this kind of relationship structure is really powerful. You don&#39;t have to go through things alone or with only one other person who&#39;ll always truly have your back.</p><p>I don&#39;t want to idealize it: polyamory is hard work, without which it becomes a toxic dumpsterfire shitshow. Being able to have a tight knit community like this and maintain it for years is tough, and requires lots of patience, honesty, vulnerability and mindfulness. But it&#39;s gone a long way towards showing me how flimsy the traditional family structure in the West can be -- particularly for those of us who have complicated relationships with the families we were born into.

As the reading mentions that some advocated for more romantic fluidity, moving with the heart. I saw this as a more youthful pursuit.  As with aging, other issues, that have more to do with compassion and duty, come to the fore.  I would say the hope of a steady relationship would be a partner to help navigate said challenges.</span></p></div></td></tr>

My partner and I each have our webs of responsibilities; the edge between us goes both ways, and I can&#39;t see how it being labelled &#34;romantic partner&#34; has any bearing on the rest of the web.  Sometimes that edge makes dealing with a particular family situation easier, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even possible to say whether there&#39;s any net effect, since of course there&#39;s more to it than this, and the experiment only gets run once.</p><p>There are two straightforward contributors to younger people being more interested in that sort of romantic fluidity: hormones and energy.

In the nineteenth century its residents were among the closest neighbors to a utopian socialist commune, set up by John Humphrey Noyes, lasting from 1848 until 1881. This commune, called the Oneida Community, produced silk and canned goods until the manufacturing of flatware picked up in the later years of the Community&#39;s existence. This would lead to the foundation of Oneida Limited, a company which survived the Community and became one of America&#39;s most important flatware producers in the twentieth century.</p><p>Another intentional community, Temple of the People, was established late in 1898, also in New York like Oneida. They were not based on free love, but on Theosophy.  They did have similar notions about unconditional love in a Christian brotherhood sort of way. They moved to Halcyon, California, in 1903.  John Varian raised his family here, including the famous set of engineers, Russell and Sigurd Varian, whose inventions are often credited with establishing Silicon Valley.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_and_Sigurd_Varian" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_and_Sigurd_Varian</a>

Witch means young people have to help their parents and grandparents alone, and the second generation might have also 4 elders to help etc. Automation help a bit, but does not suffice. The Swedish model of social services does help a bit, but again do not suffice so far.<p>Inventing &#34;multi-partners families&#34; is a way to re-create the old family model with enough young and enough not too old to help the elders and the children while still ensuring a reasonably free and productive life to anyone &#34;in the family&#34;.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to agree ourselves also in two, in more it&#39;s even harder, convincing people to a new social model it&#39;s equally harder, but probably certain trends are a potential partial answer to such demographic problems that summed to others might &#34;solve enough&#34; for the not-so-far future...

He is also concerned to prove that there is no valid reason why he personally should not do as he wants to do. For myself, as no doubt for most of my friends, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation from a certain system of morality. We objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom. The supporters of this system claimed that it embodied the meaning - the Christian meaning, they insisted - of the world.

Most of the stories featuring it end in agony and tears (Jacob, Leah, Rachel, and the handmaidens produce a lot of offspring, but boy does it sound like an awful environment as depicted).</p><p>Finally, in the New Testament, you get Jesus explicitly calling out &#34;one man, one woman&#34; as the intended design for marriage (Matthew 19:4-6):</p><p>&#34;&#39;Haven’t you read,&#39; he replied, &#39;that at the beginning the Creator &#34;made them male and female,&#34; and said, &#34;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh&#34;? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.&#39;&#34;</p><p>So, while not as clear-cut as the average evangelical would like, still fairly consistent.

		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><strong>Halfway through the</strong> manufacturing process, about 90 seconds before they start looking like shoes, New Balance 990s are just two-dimensional slabs of branded fabric and leather, flat enough to be stacked, rubber–banded together, and passed from one worker to the next. As much as the two gray “N” logos stitched on each sheet of 990 material, it is the pattern of the upper that makes it recognizable, even without the familiar curves of a sneaker. Somehow, the essence of the 990 arrives ahead of those things that actually make it a shoe—sole, laces, tongue—beloved for years by normcore icons Adam Sandler and Steve Jobs, and, more recently, by style mavericks like Chris Pine, Zoë Kravitz, and Timothée Chalamet. </p><p>Understanding the evolution of the 990 is a useful way of appreciating how New Balance, America’s most sensible sneaker brand, has captured the zeitgeist in these decidedly nonsensical times. When the 990 was launched in 1982, its four years of development made it the first running shoe with a $100 retail price; a decade or so later, it found new life as a casual sneaker worn by dressed-down celebrities at red-carpet events; and by the turn of the millennium, the 990 had achieved a bizarre niche ubiquity among subcultures as disparate as straight-edge hardcore kids, underground hip-hop fans, and Upper West Side dads. Puzzling out how all of this came to be, and how New Balance managed to bridge the aesthetic gap between Bernie Sanders and Emily Ratajkowski to become one of the most coveted shoes on the planet—while in the process reordering the global pecking order in the $86 billion sneaker market—reveals one of the more improbable success stories in fashion right now. Getting to the bottom of it was equal parts nostalgia trip and supply-chain-management course, with a whiff of succession drama—and a journey that began in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at a New Balance factory, about 30 miles northwest of Boston.</p><p>Among countless shuttered textile mills littering the banks of the Merrimack River, the 114-year-old brick building that houses the New Balance operation is distinguished by its clock tower, a landmark visible from miles away. Walking the halls of the 525,000-square-foot building mostly gives the impression of generic, renovated modernity, but on the factory floor itself, the sheer scale of the room brings to mind its roots in the later years of the industrial revolution. Large LED scoreboards hang from walls and ceilings so that the 250 or so employees can tell, at a glance, whether they are on track to make about 3,000 shoes per day across two shifts. (New Balance is the only major American sneaker brand with such a strong manufacturing presence in the US.)</p><figure></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We’re doubling capacity in the year to come,” said Jon Bass, the factory manager who served as my tour guide. Doing this, he explained, will mean adding a second shift, so that those scoreboards stay on well into the night. Production at New Balance relies on old technology and techniques like industrial sewing machines and conditioners that use heat and humidity to soften shoes for shaping. Other devices are bigger and more modern, like the immense cabinet filled with robotic arms that execute the precise ballet of trimming, abrasion, and gluing necessary to affix a sole before other machinery heats, presses, and cures it. </p><p>On the afternoon of my visit, the workers who operate these machines were busy making the latest iteration of the 990, called the v6, in a classic all-gray colorway. The scoreboards indicated they were behind schedule by 49 pairs, which I had to verify with Bass, because the deficit hardly seemed to match the speed and quiet intensity of the workforce. Every 22 seconds, someone cut a fresh bit of leather and handed it to the next person on the assembly line, or added some fine stitching to the upper part of the shoe or gave it a sole, or did one of 32 other things that needed doing. The reason the scoreboard listed them as being in arrears, Bass explained, was that they were still getting up to speed on the 990 after wrapping up work on other models a few days earlier. These top-secret shoes included designs by Teddy Santis, the founder of New York’s ultracool Aimé Leon Dore label (or ALD), who is among a roster of New Balance creative partners that now includes Justin Saunders of JJJJound, Salehe Bembury, and Stone Island.</p><figure><p><span><p>At the New Balance factory in Lawrence, Massachusetts—one of only a few facilities where sneakers are still being made in the United States—skilled workers complete a pair of the famously-unfashionable fashionable 990s every 44 seconds.</p>
</span></p></figure><p>An early example in the shoe company’s history of collaboration started with the occasional exclusive for Cambridge, Massachusetts–based streetwear retailer Concepts back in 2007, but until recently such projects were more the exception than the rule. New Balance has since leaned into the broader trend of cross-brand collaboration, though, and Bass said the Lawrence factory is now producing more collabs than ever before. The effect has been to split one brand identity across two or more generations. “My father will only wear New Balance. He’s going to buy the gray ones,” Bass said. “But my friends, they want the Action Bronsons, they want the Teddys.” </p><p>The Teddys debuted in 2019, when Santis designed the first Aimé Leon Dore New Balances as his brand was accruing the kind of once-in-a-decade hype not seen at a Lower Manhattan clothing shop since peak Supreme. These first ALD 997s led to further collaborations, including a mid-top 550, a basketball shoe originally released in 1989. </p><p>“The 550 had virtually no presence on StockX until the Teddy Santis–led Aimé Leon Dore collaboration dropped in 2020,” said Drew Haines, who works as the director of sneakers and collectibles for the online marketplace. “That ALD collaboration kicked off what ended up being a 20-times trade increase in New Balance 550s in 2021, and today the 550 ranks as the number one top-traded New Balance silhouette on StockX. It’s even competing with the likes of Jordan 1s and Nike Dunks.” </p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In April 2021, New Balance named Santis creative director for its Made in USA line, which, under his guidance, has become “a creative weapon,” according to Yuron White, a Nike veteran who was hired as vice president of global lifestyle at New Balance in January 2020. “It is the most important part of our product line.” Creating demand for its Made in USA sneakers has a lot to do with the alchemy that arises from pairing iconoclastic designers with a brand that has true heritage and real depth in its archives. Meeting that demand, however, is all about the flexibility made possible by its US factories. The first of these was located in Belmont, near Boston, where the New Balance Arch Support Company was founded in 1906. Some seven decades later, after abandoning arch supports and prescription footwear in favor of performance running shoes, the company moved its manufacturing operations to Lawrence, where factory space and labor were abundant enough to meet the consumer demands of a ’70s jogging boom. Throughout the ’80s and ’90s, New Balance opened three more US factories, all in Maine, at a time when other major American sneaker brands were cutting costs by offshoring manufacturing to countries like Taiwan, China, and South Korea. </p><p>The definition of “Made in USA” remains hazy—as New Balance assembles more than 4 million pairs of sneakers in the USA, which by its own admission “represents a limited portion of [its] US sales.” This has been a matter of contention since the ’90s, when New Balance faced an enforcement action from the Federal Trade Commission over its claim that its products were made in the US. (According to the FTC, products that denote that they are “Made in USA” need to be made “all or virtually all” in the US.) Because some components are still imported, the company is careful to note that footwear from its Made in USA line “contains a domestic value of 70 percent or greater.” The benefits of keeping some of its production in the US are far less complicated and especially evident in recent years: Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, the brand was relatively unfazed by supply-chain bottlenecks that left competitors with unfilled orders and it even opened a new factory in Methuen, Massachusetts; recently, its five New England factories have helped New Balance avoid the whiplash suffered by other major sneaker companies, which are now sitting on bloated inventories after ordering too much stock from factories in Asia. </p><p>“We are making a big push to onshore as much as we can,” Bass told me, including, he believes, a plan to start making soles stateside. Meanwhile, in Skowhegan, Maine, New Balance is investing $65 million to expand an existing facility so it can hire over 200 new employees to double the factory’s output. In the midst of this expansion, the company passed an important milestone in 2022, when it brought in more than $5 billion in revenue for the first time. Getting there took more than a few hot designers and a willingness to experiment with classic silhouettes, like the 574 and the 990, which have stuck around long enough to become lifestyle favorites signaling style and taste rather than cutting-edge performance. Some five decades after Jim Davis bought New Balance and began naming its shoes after numbers, his son, Chris Davis, has taken a more active role as the company’s chief marketing officer and vice president for merchandising. About seven years ago, Chris Davis told me, he began laying the groundwork for a “brand transformation” that has arguably broken some of his father’s most cherished rules, and inarguably improved the company’s bottom line, even if its ambitions remain as aggressively sensible as the shoes that have carried them this far. </p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Simply put,” Davis told me, “Our goal is to be the undisputed third-largest athletic brand in the world.”</p><p>Like most people in the sneaker business, Davis never mentions his competitors by name, but when he alluded to some “key partnership breakups from competition” it seemed to me that he meant the collapse of the partnership between Adidas and Yeezy—what was less clear, and also unspoken, was any acknowledgment of the tremendous risk inherent to that end of the sneaker market, where one person can go off the deep end and potentially take hundreds of millions in revenue with them. </p><hr/><p><strong>In the ’90s,</strong> when scandals over the use of sweatshop labor in Asia were all over the news, New Balance was being reinvented in the States by its new legion of fans. That meant Jim Davis had to figure out what to make of the fact that Gen X slackers, rather than athletes, had become some of the most visible fans of his company’s best-selling running shoe models.</p><p>“I think what happened was that people in their 20s and 30s didn’t want to wear the same sneakers that a 12-year-old was wearing,” said Ed Haddad, who worked at New Balance for more than three decades, including a stint as an operations manager in the ’80s. “The very young generation, the 12- to 18-year-olds, they were embracing Reebok and Nike and all the marketing and hype surrounding them, and we became a good alternative to that.” </p><p>It seemed to concern Davis that these shoes were becoming vaguely cool—a dad shoe for record-store clerks rather than bank clerks, with an air of geek chic and enough understatement to prevent the post-grunge culture shock of trading a pair of Doc Martens for Air Jordans. New Balance, perhaps more than any other sneaker company, reflected the character of its owner, who had no shareholders to answer to and no interest in straying from the principles that had made the company a success. It was Davis, for example, who refused to move all of the company’s manufacturing overseas. Davis, too, was behind the brand’s commitment to bare-bones marketing budgets and a decades-long policy against sponsoring big-name athletes. (After signing LA Lakers star James Worthy for an estimated $1 million in the ’80s, it decided not to renew Worthy and other athletes, choosing instead to embrace the “endorsed by no one” philosophy and investing in product innovation. Despite these efforts, they still lost ground to Reebok and Nike in the market for basketball shoes.) And in the ’90s, when there was pressure to begin marketing the 990 as a retro lifestyle sneaker, Davis appeared not to accept what popular culture seemed to want from his brand. </p><p>Haddad told me Jim Davis, who declined to be interviewed, was wary of this creeping fashion nostalgia because of his long-held belief that New Balance should only ever be associated with its technical performance, in the US market. Its biggest successes, after all, had come from focusing on quality, performance, and innovation: breakthroughs like the 574, the 990, and the W320, which was one of the first running shoes developed especially for women. Then there was the fact that so many New Balance adherents had fallen in love with the brand simply because its sneakers actually fit them well. </p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Every shoe we made at that time came in multiple widths,” Haddad told me. “That was our reason for being. It was the thing that kept us in business. Nobody competed with us in that space for a lot of years.” As the ’90s wore on, Davis stuck to his policy of promoting New Balance sneakers as performance footwear for athletes. </p><p>In December, I visited Boston’s Brighton neighborhood for a look at the New Balance headquarters, which includes an adjacent indoor-track facility and looks like it cost more than the reported $500 million. At the company’s “smash lab,” samples of experimental foam sat piled on a countertop waiting to be prodded, crushed, and evaluated by sophisticated machinery. These neat little squares of squishy white foam had been sourced by Sean Murphy and his innovation and engineering team, or, in some cases, invented by them. Some would end up on prototypes, I was told, and eventually on new sneakers like the one being bent repeatedly by a robotic machine nearby, so that the tip of the toe touched the top of the heel before it was released and then bent back again. What really interested me, though, was the fact that classic silhouettes like the 990 periodically pass through the smash lab for an upgraded foam sole—an example of New Balance’s commitment to innovation and technology rather than indulging in retro artifacts and time capsule nostalgia. </p><p>Murphy gave me a tour of the rest of the sports research lab, where some rooms were dedicated to measuring otherwise imperceptible aspects of extraordinary athletes doing extraordinary things while wearing extraordinary gear. Others had more highly specialized purposes, like studying how well various fabrics performed when stretched over a mannequin that had been purpose-built to perspire. At the end of the line was a room where various visions for New Balance’s future had been scribbled on a large whiteboard. </p><p>On our way out of the lab, we passed a room that signaled a more profound revision of the New Balance rulebook. Inside, jerseys and other sportswear hung on the wall to honor the sort of big-name sponsorship deals New Balance had once shunned. One of them belonged to NBA star Kawhi Leonard, whose deal with New Balance is allegedly worth around $5 million per year. Others belonged to soccer star Bukayo Saka and tennis prodigy Coco Gauff. Then there was the Olympic track star Sydney McLaughlin, who had recently appeared alongside rapper Action Bronson in an ad campaign for the 990v6, 40 years after the original 990 debuted with the dad-joke tagline now synonymous with the brand and its down-to-earth ambitions: “On a scale of 1,000, this shoe is a 990.”</p><p>A few months after my visit, when New Balance signed a sponsorship deal with Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani, I found myself wondering whether they might need to build a whole new room.</p><figure><p><span>The New Balance extended universe (clockwise from top left): Rising tennis star Coco Gauff wearing her signature shoes; Jack Harlow and his personal 550s; sprinter Trayvon Bromell, and Timothée Chalamet in the iconic gray 990s; plus legendary pro skater Andrew Reynolds, brand ambassador Aminé, and normcore-fashion queen Hailey Bieber, all wearing the brand.</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><hr/><p><strong>When I met</strong> Yuron White at the gleaming 250,000 square feet of glass and steel that houses New Balance’s global headquarters in Boston, he was in the midst of a chaotic, weeklong visit from his home in Oregon. He moved there for a job with Nike, where he worked for more than two decades, most recently as the vice president and general manager for its Jordan brand footwear. In January 2020, White was hired as the vice president of global lifestyle at New Balance, putting him in charge of all those shoes that aged so gracefully out of the cutting-edge performance category and into the vanguard of high-fashion streetwear. </p><p>Dressed in camouflage Off-White pants and a black hoodie, he was rushing from one corner of the sprawling campus to another as I arrived. When he finally had time to talk, one of the first things he told me was how pleased he was to be working for a brand that is “not good because it’s old, but old because it’s good.” What really impressed him, though, was how eager his colleagues were to change what wasn’t working to help grow the brand. “They were unapologetic about, you know, the things they didn’t know,” White told me. “But they were also laser-focused on where they wanted to be.” </p><p>Foremost among these change agents was Chris Davis, who joined New Balance in 2008 and began taking on more responsibility for its direction around 2010. Ostensibly the head of marketing and vice president of merchandising, it seems likely to me that Davis is also poised to inherit the company, so it was not surprising to hear his name come up in every conversation about what New Balance has accomplished in the past decade, when its revenues more than doubled, from $2.39 billion in 2012 to over $5 billion in 2022.</p><p>When I spoke to Davis in mid-December, he told me this “brand transformation began about six-and-a-half, seven years ago,” but was vague about what inspired it. One possibility occurred to me after our conversation, when I remembered how a New Balance spokesperson told <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> in November 2016, that “the Obama administration turned a deaf ear” to the company’s opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. “Frankly,” the spokesperson added, “with President-elect Trump, we feel things are going to move in the right direction.” It was also reported that Jim Davis had contributed $396,500 toward Trump’s campaign. During that time, New Balance remained in the news with <em>The Washington Post</em> reporting that “opponents of Trump” were “accusing the company of formally endorsing not just his stance on TPP, but [his] entire platform.” When an alt-right blogger started speaking out in support of the company, New Balance issued a pointed statement on social media in response, stating: “New Balance does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.” It was a reminder of how easily brand identity can be shaped by consumers in lieu of messaging from the brand itself. What followed appears to be an acceleration of a succession plan that has focused on marketing as much as growth.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>These changes seem to have had a positive impact on the future of New Balance’s positioning in the streetwear and fashion worlds as well. “Respect and empathy are fundamental to me, as well as the sense of family and of being part of a special company,” says Stone Island creative director Carlo Rivetti, who launched a buzzy collab with New Balance earlier this month. “I felt the same values when I met Chris Davis and his team.”</p><p>At the end of 2018, Joe Preston succeeded Rob DeMartini as CEO, and immediately prioritized advertising and sponsorships. Marketing budgets soared. Partnerships with designers like Santis and Saunders became a priority. So, too, did partnerships with athletes like Kawhi Leonard, whom New Balance targeted in 2018, after he turned down the contract extension offered by Nike. Next came White, who had previously worked with Leonard. Preston’s overwhelming success as CEO may have something to do with his roots at the company: In 1995, he began his career with New Balance as a senior product manager for lifestyle and running, and throughout the years worked on shoes like the 574, the 990, and the 801, as they took over college campuses. </p><p>“From 1994 through the end of that decade we literally grew from $125 million to over $1 billion in revenue,” Preston told me recently. Between 2001 and 2015, he said, the company was focused on building its international presence, culminating with its entry into the soccer market in 2015. Since then, it has focused on previously neglected domestic categories like skateboarding, where Nike and Adidas have been making inroads for years. In December, New Balance announced a sponsorship deal with skateboarding legend Andrew Reynolds, who, at 44, straddles the demographic divide described by Bass during my factory tour in Lawrence—a middle-aged athlete whose dad shoe cred is as real as his need for a more supportive sole. </p><p>Its most ambitious move, though, has been to reenter the basketball-sneaker business, which was overshadowed in the days when the Reebok Pump was challenging the Air Jordan. Since 2019, New Balance has increased its marketing investment by 37 percent. What this investment in basketball amounts to, on the heels of a decade of heavy investment in rebranding performance classics as lifestyle favorites, is a complete reversal of the ’90s New Balance playbook. Whether this gets them to number three in the sneaker business is anyone’s guess, but it’s worth considering how unlikely it would have seemed, even a few years ago, that New Balance would rival peak Yeezy hype. With its plans of expanding manufacturing output in New England, it appears that the company has no intention of slowing down its momentum.</p><p>The bigger question is what it may cost New Balance to play by the same rules as its competitors, whose market caps get peeled back whenever some collaborator makes antisemitic remarks or gets accused of unseemly behavior. Moderating these risks, and protecting that essence that emerges before the sole, laces, and tongue are stitched onto a pair of New Balance sneakers, might have less to do with any playbook or sponsorship deal than with something Chris Davis said when I asked why the brand needed transforming. It was a comment I flagged as meaningless marketing talk, which, in retrospect, might have been the all too earnest truth: “We’re focused on being the best version of ourselves.” </p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure></figure><p><strong>Joshua Hunt</strong> <em>is a writer in Portland, Oregon, and a former Tokyo-based correspondent for Reuters.</em></p><p><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the March 2023 issue of GQ with the title “Welcome to the Sensible-Sneaker Revolution”</em></p><hr/><p><em><strong>Collage Credits:</strong> Gauff: Tim Clayton/Corbis.

    <p>“Doc comments” are comments that appear immediately before top-level package,
const, func, type, and var declarations with no intervening newlines.
Every exported (capitalized) name should have a doc comment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/go/doc">go/doc</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/go/doc/comment">go/doc/comment</a> packages
provide the ability to extract documentation from Go source code,
and a variety of tools make use of this functionality.
The <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Show_documentation_for_package_or_symbol"><code>go</code> <code>doc</code></a>
command looks up and prints the doc comment for a given package or symbol.
(A symbol is a top-level const, func, type, or var.)
The web server <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> shows the documentation
for public Go packages (when their licenses permit that use).
The program serving that site is
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">golang.org/x/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite</a>,
which can also be run locally to view documentation for private modules
or without an internet connection.
The language server <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gopls</a>
provides documentation when editing Go source files in IDEs.</p>
<p>The rest of this page documents how to write Go doc comments.</p>
<h2 id="package">Packages</h2>
<p>Every package should have a package comment introducing the package.
It provides information relevant to the package as a whole
and generally sets expectations for the package.
Especially in large packages, it can be helpful for the package comment
to give a brief overview of the most important parts of the API,
linking to other doc comments as needed.</p>
<p>If the package is simple, the package comment can be brief.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Package path implements utility routines for manipulating slash-separated
// paths.
//
// The path package should only be used for paths separated by forward
// slashes, such as the paths in URLs. This package does not deal with
// Windows paths with drive letters or backslashes; to manipulate
// operating system paths, use the [path/filepath] package.
package path
</code></pre>
<p>The square brackets in <code>[path/filepath]</code> create a <a href="#links">documentation link</a>.</p>
<p>As can be seen in this example, Go doc comments use complete sentences.
For a package comment, that means the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/go/doc/#Package.Synopsis">first sentence</a>
begins with “Package <name>”.</name></p>
<p>For multi-file packages, the package comment should only be in one source file.
If multiple files have package comments, they are concatenated to form one
large comment for the entire package.</p>
<h2 id="cmd">Commands</h2>
<p>A package comment for a command is similar, but it describes the behavior
of the program rather than the Go symbols in the package.
The first sentence conventionally begins with the name of the program itself,
capitalized because it is at the start of a sentence.
For example, here is an abridged version of the package comment for <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/gofmt">gofmt</a>:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Gofmt formats Go programs.
It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment.
Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file,
it operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in
that directory, recursively. (Files starting with a period are ignored.)
By default, gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:

    gofmt [flags] [path ...]

The flags are:

    -d
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file&#39;s formatting is different than gofmt&#39;s, print diffs
        to standard output.
    -w
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file&#39;s formatting is different from gofmt&#39;s, overwrite it
        with gofmt&#39;s version. If an error occurred during overwriting,
        the original file is restored from an automatic backup.

When gofmt reads from standard input, it accepts either a full Go program
or a program fragment. A program fragment must be a syntactically
valid declaration list, statement list, or expression. When formatting
such a fragment, gofmt preserves leading indentation as well as leading
and trailing spaces, so that individual sections of a Go program can be
formatted by piping them through gofmt.
*/
package main
</code></pre>
<p>The beginning of the comment is written using
<a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">semantic linefeeds</a>,
in which each new sentence or long phrase is on a line by itself,
which can make diffs easier to read as code and comments evolve.
The later paragraphs happen not to follow this convention
and have been wrapped by hand.
Whatever is best for your code base is fine.
Either way, <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> and <code>pkgsite</code> rewrap doc comment text when printing it.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ go doc gofmt
Gofmt formats Go programs. It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for
alignment. Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file, it
operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in that
directory, recursively. (Files starting with a period are ignored.) By default,
gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:

    gofmt [flags] [path ...]

The flags are:

    -d
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file&#39;s formatting is different than gofmt&#39;s, print diffs
        to standard output.
...
</code></pre>
<p>The indented lines are treated as preformatted text:
they are not rewrapped and are printed in code font
in HTML and Markdown presentations.
(The <a href="#syntax">Syntax</a> section below gives the details.)</p>
<h2 id="type">Types</h2>
<p>A type’s doc comment should explain what each instance of that type represents or provides.
If the API is simple, the doc comment can be quite short.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package zip

// A Reader serves content from a ZIP archive.
type Reader struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>By default, programmers should expect that a type is safe for use only by
a single goroutine at a time.
If a type provides stronger guarantees, the doc comment should state them.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package regexp

// Regexp is the representation of a compiled regular expression.
// A Regexp is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines,
// except for configuration methods, such as Longest.
type Regexp struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Go types should also aim to make the zero value have a useful meaning.
If it isn’t obvious, that meaning should be documented. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package bytes

// A Buffer is a variable-sized buffer of bytes with Read and Write methods.
// The zero value for Buffer is an empty buffer ready to use.
type Buffer struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>For a struct with exported fields, either the doc comment or per-field comments
should explain the meaning of each exported field.
For example, this type’s doc comment explains the fields:</p>
<pre><code>package io

// A LimitedReader reads from R but limits the amount of
// data returned to just N bytes. Each call to Read
// updates N to reflect the new amount remaining.
// Read returns EOF when N &lt;= 0.
type LimitedReader struct {
    R   Reader // underlying reader
    N   int64  // max bytes remaining
}
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, this type’s doc comment leaves the explanations to per-field comments:</p>
<pre><code>package comment

// A Printer is a doc comment printer.
// The fields in the struct can be filled in before calling
// any of the printing methods
// in order to customize the details of the printing process.
type Printer struct {
    // HeadingLevel is the nesting level used for
    // HTML and Markdown headings.
    // If HeadingLevel is zero, it defaults to level 3,
    // meaning to use &lt;h3&gt; and ###.
    HeadingLevel int
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>As with packages (above) and funcs (below), doc comments for types
start with complete sentences naming the declared symbol.
An explicit subject often makes the wording clearer,
and it makes the text easier to search, whether on a web page
or a command line.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ go doc -all regexp | grep pairs
pairs within the input string: result[2*n:2*n+2] identifies the indexes
    FindReaderSubmatchIndex returns a slice holding the index pairs identifying
    FindStringSubmatchIndex returns a slice holding the index pairs identifying
    FindSubmatchIndex returns a slice holding the index pairs identifying the
$
</code></pre>
<h2 id="func">Funcs</h2>
<p>A function’s doc comment should explain what the function returns
or, for functions called for side effects, what it does.
Named parameters and results can be referred to directly in
the comment, without any special syntax like backquotes.
(A consequence of this convention is that names like <code>a</code>,
which might be mistaken for ordinary words, are typically avoided.)
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package strconv

// Quote returns a double-quoted Go string literal representing s.
// The returned string uses Go escape sequences (\t, \n, \xFF, \u0100)
// for control characters and non-printable characters as defined by IsPrint.
func Quote(s string) string {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre><code>package os

// Exit causes the current program to exit with the given status code.
// Conventionally, code zero indicates success, non-zero an error.
// The program terminates immediately; deferred functions are not run.
//
// For portability, the status code should be in the range [0, 125].
func Exit(code int) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Doc comments typically use the phrase “reports whether”
to describe functions that return a boolean.
The phrase “or not” is unnecessary.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package strings

// HasPrefix reports whether the string s begins with prefix.
func HasPrefix(s, prefix string) bool
</code></pre>
<p>If a doc comment needs to explain multiple results,
naming the results can make the doc comment more understandable,
even if the names are not used in the body of the function.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package io

// Copy copies from src to dst until either EOF is reached
// on src or an error occurs. It returns the total number of bytes
// written and the first error encountered while copying, if any.
//
// A successful Copy returns err == nil, not err == EOF.
// Because Copy is defined to read from src until EOF, it does
// not treat an EOF from Read as an error to be reported.
func Copy(dst Writer, src Reader) (n int64, err error) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Conversely, when the results don’t need to be named in the doc comment,
they are usually omitted in the code as well, like in the <code>Quote</code> example above,
to avoid cluttering the presentation.</p>
<p>These rules all apply both to plain functions and to methods.
For methods, using the same receiver name avoids needless
variation when listing all the methods of a type:</p>
<pre><code>$ go doc bytes.Buffer
package bytes // import &#34;bytes&#34;

type Buffer struct {
    // Has unexported fields.
}
    A Buffer is a variable-sized buffer of bytes with Read and Write methods.
    The zero value for Buffer is an empty buffer ready to use.

func NewBuffer(buf []byte) *Buffer
func NewBufferString(s string) *Buffer
func (b *Buffer) Bytes() []byte
func (b *Buffer) Cap() int
func (b *Buffer) Grow(n int)
func (b *Buffer) Len() int
func (b *Buffer) Next(n int) []byte
func (b *Buffer) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error)
...
</code></pre>
<p>This example also shows that top-level functions returning a type <code>T</code> or pointer <code>*T</code>,
perhaps with an additional error result,
are shown alongside the type <code>T</code> and its methods,
under the assumption that they are <code>T</code>’s constructors.</p>
<p>By default, programmers can assume that a top-level function
is safe to call from multiple goroutines;
this fact need not be stated explicitly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as noted in the previous section,
using an instance of a type in any way,
including calling a method, is typically assumed
to be restricted to a single goroutine at a time.
If the methods that are safe for concurrent use
are not documented in the type’s doc comment,
they should be documented in per-method comments.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package sql

// Close returns the connection to the connection pool.
// All operations after a Close will return with ErrConnDone.
// Close is safe to call concurrently with other operations and will
// block until all other operations finish. It may be useful to first
// cancel any used context and then call Close directly after.
func (c *Conn) Close() error {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that function and method doc comments focus on
what the operation returns or does,
detailing what the caller needs to know.
Special cases can be particularly important to document.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package math

// Sqrt returns the square root of x.
//
// Special cases are:
//
//  Sqrt(+Inf) = +Inf
//  Sqrt(±0) = ±0
//  Sqrt(x &lt; 0) = NaN
//  Sqrt(NaN) = NaN
func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Doc comments should not explain internal details
such as the algorithm used in the current implementation.
Those are best left to comments inside the function body.
It may be appropriate to give asymptotic time or space bounds
when that detail is particularly important to callers.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package sort

// Sort sorts data in ascending order as determined by the Less method.
// It makes one call to data.Len to determine n and O(n*log(n)) calls to
// data.Less and data.Swap. The sort is not guaranteed to be stable.
func Sort(data Interface) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because this doc comment makes no mention of which sorting algorithm is used,
it is easier to change the implementation to use a different algorithm in the future.</p>
<h2 id="const">Consts</h2>
<p>Go’s declaration syntax allows grouping of declarations,
in which case a single doc comment can introduce a group of related constants,
with individual constants only documented by short end-of-line comments.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package scanner // import &#34;text/scanner&#34;

// The result of Scan is one of these tokens or a Unicode character.
const (
    EOF = -(iota + 1)
    Ident
    Int
    Float
    Char
    ...
)
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes the group needs no doc comment at all. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package unicode // import &#34;unicode&#34;

const (
    MaxRune         = &#39;\U0010FFFF&#39; // maximum valid Unicode code point.
    ReplacementChar = &#39;\uFFFD&#39;     // represents invalid code points.
    MaxASCII        = &#39;\u007F&#39;     // maximum ASCII value.
    MaxLatin1       = &#39;\u00FF&#39;     // maximum Latin-1 value.
)
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, ungrouped constants typically warrant a full
doc comment starting with a complete sentence. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package unicode

// Version is the Unicode edition from which the tables are derived.
const Version = &#34;13.0.0&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>Typed constants are displayed next to the declaration of their type
and as a result often omit a const group doc comment in favor of
the type’s doc comment.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package syntax

// An Op is a single regular expression operator.
type Op uint8

const (
    OpNoMatch        Op = 1 + iota // matches no strings
    OpEmptyMatch                   // matches empty string
    OpLiteral                      // matches Runes sequence
    OpCharClass                    // matches Runes interpreted as range pair list
    OpAnyCharNotNL                 // matches any character except newline
    ...
)
</code></pre>
<p>(See <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax#Op" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax#Op</a> for the HTML presentation.)</p>
<h2 id="var">Vars</h2>
<p>The conventions for variables are the same as those for constants.
For example, here is a set of grouped variables:</p>
<pre><code>package fs

// Generic file system errors.
// Errors returned by file systems can be tested against these errors
// using errors.Is.
var (
    ErrInvalid    = errInvalid()    // &#34;invalid argument&#34;
    ErrPermission = errPermission() // &#34;permission denied&#34;
    ErrExist      = errExist()      // &#34;file already exists&#34;
    ErrNotExist   = errNotExist()   // &#34;file does not exist&#34;
    ErrClosed     = errClosed()     // &#34;file already closed&#34;
)
</code></pre>
<p>And a single variable:</p>
<pre><code>package unicode

// Scripts is the set of Unicode script tables.
var Scripts = map[string]*RangeTable{
    &#34;Adlam&#34;:                  Adlam,
    &#34;Ahom&#34;:                   Ahom,
    &#34;Anatolian_Hieroglyphs&#34;:  Anatolian_Hieroglyphs,
    &#34;Arabic&#34;:                 Arabic,
    &#34;Armenian&#34;:               Armenian,
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Go doc comments are written in a simple syntax that supports
paragraphs, headings, links, lists, and preformatted code blocks.
To keep comments lightweight and readable in source files,
there is no support for complex features like font changes or raw HTML.
Markdown aficionados can view the syntax as a simplified subset of Markdown.</p>
<p>The standard formatter <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/gofmt">gofmt</a> reformats doc comments
to use a canonical formatting for each of these features.
Gofmt aims for readability and user control over how comments
are written in source code but will adjust presentation to make
the semantic meaning of a particular comment clearer,
analogous to reformatting <code>1+2 * 3</code> to <code>1 + 2*3</code> in ordinary source code.</p>
<p>Directive comments such as <code>//go:generate</code> are not
considered part of a doc comment and are omitted from
rendered documentation.
Gofmt moves directive comments to the end of the doc comment,
preceded by a blank line.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package regexp

// An Op is a single regular expression operator.
//
//go:generate stringer -type Op -trimprefix Op
type Op uint8
</code></pre>
<p>A directive comment is a line matching the regular expression
<code>//(line |extern |export |[a-z0-9]+:[a-z0-9])</code>.
Tools that define their own directives should use the form
<code>//toolname:directive</code>.</p>
<p>Gofmt removes leading and trailing blank lines in doc comments.
If all lines in a doc comment begin with the same sequence of
spaces and tabs, gofmt removes that prefix.</p>
<h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
<p>A paragraph is a span of unindented non-blank lines.
We’ve already seen many examples of paragraphs.</p>
<p>A pair of consecutive backticks (` U+0060)
is interpreted as a Unicode left quote (“ U+201C),
and a pair of consecutive single quotes (&#39; U+0027)
is interpreted as a Unicode right quote (” U+201D).</p>
<p>Gofmt preserves line breaks in paragraph text: it does not rewrap the text.
This allows the use of <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">semantic linefeeds</a>,
as seen earlier.
Gofmt replaces duplicated blank lines between paragraphs
with a single blank line.
Gofmt also reformats consecutive backticks or single quotes
to their Unicode interpretations.</p>
<h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
<p>A heading is a line beginning with a number sign (U+0023) and then a space and the heading text.
To be recognized as a heading, the line must be unindented and set off from adjacent paragraph text
by blank lines.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Package strconv implements conversions to and from string representations
// of basic data types.
//
// # Numeric Conversions
//
// The most common numeric conversions are [Atoi] (string to int) and [Itoa] (int to string).
...
package strconv
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<pre><code>// #This is not a heading, because there is no space.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// # because it is multiple lines.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// because it is also multiple lines.
//
// The next paragraph is not a heading, because there is no additional text:
//
// #
//
// In the middle of a span of non-blank lines,
// # this is not a heading either.
//
//     # This is not a heading, because it is indented.
</code></pre>
<p>The # syntax was added in Go 1.19.
Before Go 1.19, headings were identified implicitly by single-line paragraphs
satisfying certain conditions, most notably the lack of any terminating punctuation.</p>
<p>Gofmt reformats <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/51082-godocfmt.md#headings" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">lines treated as implicit headings</a>
by earlier versions of Go to use # headings instead.
If the reformatting is not appropriate—that is, if the line was not meant to be a heading—the easiest
way to make it a paragraph is to introduce terminating punctuation
such as a period or colon, or to break it into two lines.</p>
<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<p>A span of unindented non-blank lines defines link targets
when every line is of the form “[Text]: URL”.
In other text in the same doc comment,
“[Text]” represents a link to URL using the given text—in HTML,
&lt;a href=“URL”&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Package json implements encoding and decoding of JSON as defined in
// [RFC 7159]. The mapping between JSON and Go values is described
// in the documentation for the Marshal and Unmarshal functions.
//
// For an introduction to this package, see the article
// “[JSON and Go].”
//
// [RFC 7159]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159
// [JSON and Go]: https://golang.org/doc/articles/json_and_go.html
package json
</code></pre>
<p>By keeping URLs in a separate section,
this format only minimally interrupts the flow of the actual text.
It also roughly matches the Markdown
<a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#shortcut-reference-link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">shortcut reference link format</a>,
without the optional title text.</p>
<p>If there is no corresponding URL declaration,
then (except for doc links, described in the next section)
“[Text]” is not a hyperlink, and the square brackets are preserved
when displayed.
Each doc comment is considered independently:
link target definitions in one comment do not affect other comments.</p>
<p>Although link target definition blocks may be interleaved with
ordinary paragraphs, gofmt moves all link target definitions to
the end of the doc comment,
in up to two blocks: first a block containing all the link targets
that are referenced in the comment, and then a block
containing all the targets <em>not</em> referenced in the comment.
The separate block makes unused targets easy
to notice and fix (in case the links or the definitions have typos)
or to delete (in case the definitions are no longer needed).</p>
<p>Plain text that is recognized as a URL is automatically linked in HTML renderings.</p>
<h3 id="doclinks">Doc links</h3>
<p>Doc links are links of the form “[Name1]” or “[Name1.Name2]” to refer
to exported identifiers in the current package, or “[pkg]”,
“[pkg.Name1]”, or “[pkg.Name1.Name2]” to refer to identifiers in other
packages.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>package bytes

// ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF and appends it to the buffer, growing
// the buffer as needed. The return value n is the number of bytes read. Any
// error except [io.EOF] encountered during the read is also returned. If the
// buffer becomes too large, ReadFrom will panic with [ErrTooLarge].
func (b *Buffer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64, err error) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The bracketed text for a symbol link
can include an optional leading star, making it easy to refer to
pointer types, such as [*bytes.Buffer].</p>
<p>When referring to other packages, “pkg” can be either a full import path
or the assumed package name of an existing import. The assumed package
name is either the identifier in a renamed import or else
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/internal/imports#ImportPathToAssumedName" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the name assumed by
goimports</a>.
(Goimports inserts renamings when that assumption is not correct, so
this rule should work for essentially all Go code.)
For example, if the current package imports encoding/json,
then “[json.Decoder]” can be written in place of “[encoding/json.Decoder]”
to link to the docs for encoding/json’s Decoder.
If different source files in a package import different packages using the same name,
then the shorthand is ambiguous and cannot be used.</p>
<p>A “pkg” is only
assumed to be a full import path if it starts with a domain name (a
path element with a dot) or is one of the packages from the standard
library (“[os]”, “[encoding/json]”, and so on).
For example, <code>[os.File]</code> and <code>[example.com/sys.File]</code> are documentation links
(the latter will be a broken link),
but <code>[os/sys.File]</code> is not, because there is no os/sys package in the standard library.</p>
<p>To avoid problems with
maps, generics, and array types, doc links must be both preceded and
followed by punctuation, spaces, tabs, or the start or end of a line.
For example, the text “map[ast.Expr]TypeAndValue” does not contain
a doc link.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>A list is a span of indented or blank lines
(which would otherwise be a code block,
as described in the next section)
in which the first indented line begins with
a bullet list marker or a numbered list marker.</p>
<p>A bullet list marker is a star, plus, dash, or Unicode bullet
(*, +, -, •; U+002A, U+002B, U+002D, U+2022)
followed by a space or tab and then text.
In a bullet list, each line beginning with a bullet list
marker starts a new list item.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>package url

// PublicSuffixList provides the public suffix of a domain. For example:
//   - the public suffix of &#34;example.com&#34; is &#34;com&#34;,
//   - the public suffix of &#34;foo1.foo2.foo3.co.uk&#34; is &#34;co.uk&#34;, and
//   - the public suffix of &#34;bar.pvt.k12.ma.us&#34; is &#34;pvt.k12.ma.us&#34;.
//
// Implementations of PublicSuffixList must be safe for concurrent use by
// multiple goroutines.
//
// An implementation that always returns &#34;&#34; is valid and may be useful for
// testing but it is not secure: it means that the HTTP server for foo.com can
// set a cookie for bar.com.
//
// A public suffix list implementation is in the package
// golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix.
type PublicSuffixList interface {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>A numbered list marker is a decimal number of any length
followed by a period or right parenthesis, then a space or tab, and then text.
In a numbered list, each line beginning with a number list marker starts a new list item.
Item numbers are left as is, never renumbered.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>package path

// Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path
// by purely lexical processing. It applies the following rules
// iteratively until no further processing can be done:
//
//  1. Replace multiple slashes with a single slash.
//  2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
//  3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)
//     along with the non-.. element that precedes it.
//  4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path:
//     that is, replace &#34;/..&#34; by &#34;/&#34; at the beginning of a path.
//
// The returned path ends in a slash only if it is the root &#34;/&#34;.
//
// If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean
// returns the string &#34;.&#34;.
//
// See also Rob Pike, “[Lexical File Names in Plan 9].”
//
// [Lexical File Names in Plan 9]: https://9p.io/sys/doc/lexnames.html
func Clean(path string) string {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>List items only contain paragraphs, not code blocks or nested lists.
This avoids any space-counting subtlety as well as questions about
how many spaces a tab counts for in inconsistent indentation.</p>
<p>Gofmt reformats bullet lists to use a dash as the bullet marker,
two spaces of indentation before the dash,
and four spaces of indentation for continuation lines.</p>
<p>Gofmt reformats numbered lists to use a single space before the number,
a period after the number, and again
four spaces of indentation for continuation lines.</p>
<p>Gofmt preserves but does not require a blank line between a list and the preceding paragraph.
It inserts a blank line between a list and the following paragraph or heading.</p>
<h3 id="code">Code blocks</h3>
<p>A code block is a span of indented or blank lines
not starting with a bullet list marker or numbered list marker.
It is rendered as preformatted text (a &lt;pre&gt; block in HTML).</p>
<p>Code blocks often contain Go code. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package sort

// Search uses binary search...
//
// As a more whimsical example, this program guesses your number:
//
//  func GuessingGame() {
//      var s string
//      fmt.Printf(&#34;Pick an integer from 0 to 100.\n&#34;)
//      answer := sort.Search(100, func(i int) bool {
//          fmt.Printf(&#34;Is your number &lt;= %d? &#34;, i)
//          fmt.Scanf(&#34;%s&#34;, &amp;s)
//          return s != &#34;&#34; &amp;&amp; s[0] == &#39;y&#39;
//      })
//      fmt.Printf(&#34;Your number is %d.\n&#34;, answer)
//  }
func Search(n int, f func(int) bool) int {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, code blocks also often contain preformatted text besides code. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package path

// Match reports whether name matches the shell pattern.
// The pattern syntax is:
//
//  pattern:
//      { term }
//  term:
//      &#39;*&#39;         matches any sequence of non-/ characters
//      &#39;?&#39;         matches any single non-/ character
//      &#39;[&#39; [ &#39;^&#39; ] { character-range } &#39;]&#39;
//                  character class (must be non-empty)
//      c           matches character c (c != &#39;*&#39;, &#39;?&#39;, &#39;\\&#39;, &#39;[&#39;)
//      &#39;\\&#39; c      matches character c
//
//  character-range:
//      c           matches character c (c != &#39;\\&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;]&#39;)
//      &#39;\\&#39; c      matches character c
//      lo &#39;-&#39; hi   matches character c for lo &lt;= c &lt;= hi
//
// Match requires pattern to match all of name, not just a substring.
// The only possible returned error is [ErrBadPattern], when pattern
// is malformed.
func Match(pattern, name string) (matched bool, err error) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Gofmt indents all lines in a code block by a single tab,
replacing any other indentation the non-blank lines have in common.
Gofmt also inserts a blank line before and after each code block,
distinguishing the code block clearly from the surrounding paragraph text.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes">Common mistakes and pitfalls</h2>
<p>The rule that any span of indented or blank lines
in a doc comment is rendered as a code block
dates to the earliest days of Go.
Unfortunately, the lack of support for doc comments in gofmt
has led to many existing comments that use indentation
without meaning to create a code block.</p>
<p>For example, this unindented list has always been interpreted
by godoc as a three-line paragraph followed by a one-line code block:</p>
<pre><code>package http

// cancelTimerBody is an io.ReadCloser that wraps rc with two features:
// 1) On Read error or close, the stop func is called.
// 2) On Read failure, if reqDidTimeout is true, the error is wrapped and
//    marked as net.Error that hit its timeout.
type cancelTimerBody struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This always rendered in <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>cancelTimerBody is an io.ReadCloser that wraps rc with two features:
1) On Read error or close, the stop func is called. 2) On Read failure,
if reqDidTimeout is true, the error is wrapped and

    marked as net.Error that hit its timeout.
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the command in this comment is a one-line paragraph
followed by a one-line code block:</p>
<pre><code>package smtp

// localhostCert is a PEM-encoded TLS cert generated from src/crypto/tls:
//
// go run generate_cert.go --rsa-bits 1024 --host 127.0.0.1,::1,example.com \
//     --ca --start-date &#34;Jan 1 00:00:00 1970&#34; --duration=1000000h
var localhostCert = []byte(`...`)
</code></pre>
<p>This rendered in <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>localhostCert is a PEM-encoded TLS cert generated from src/crypto/tls:

go run generate_cert.go --rsa-bits 1024 --host 127.0.0.1,::1,example.com \

    --ca --start-date &#34;Jan 1 00:00:00 1970&#34; --duration=1000000h
</code></pre>
<p>And this comment is a two-line paragraph (the second line is “{”),
followed by a six-line indented code block and a one-line paragraph (“}”).</p>
<pre><code>// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:
// {
//  &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;MyAPIObject&#34;,
//  &#34;apiVersion&#34;:&#34;v1&#34;,
//  &#34;myPlugin&#34;: {
//      &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;PluginA&#34;,
//      &#34;aOption&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;,
//  },
// }
</code></pre>
<p>And this rendered in <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>On the wire, the JSON will look something like this: {

    &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;MyAPIObject&#34;,
    &#34;apiVersion&#34;:&#34;v1&#34;,
    &#34;myPlugin&#34;: {
        &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;PluginA&#34;,
        &#34;aOption&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;,
    },

}
</code></pre>
<p>Another common mistake was an unindented Go function definition
or block statement, similarly bracketed by “{” and “}”.</p>
<p>The introduction of doc comment reformatting in Go 1.19’s gofmt makes mistakes
like these more visible by adding blank lines around the code blocks.</p>
<p>Analysis in 2022 found that only 3% of doc comments in public Go modules
were reformatted at all by the draft Go 1.19 gofmt.
Limiting ourselves to those comments, about 87% of gofmt’s reformattings
preserved the structure that a person would infer from reading the comment;
about 6% were tripped up by these kinds of unindented lists,
unindented multiline shell commands, and unindented brace-delimited code blocks.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, the Go 1.19 gofmt applies a few heuristics to merge
unindented lines into an adjacent indented list or code block.
With those adjustments, the Go 1.19 gofmt reformats the above examples to:</p>
<pre><code>// cancelTimerBody is an io.ReadCloser that wraps rc with two features:
//  1. On Read error or close, the stop func is called.
//  2. On Read failure, if reqDidTimeout is true, the error is wrapped and
//     marked as net.Error that hit its timeout.

// localhostCert is a PEM-encoded TLS cert generated from src/crypto/tls:
//
//  go run generate_cert.go --rsa-bits 1024 --host 127.0.0.1,::1,example.com \
//      --ca --start-date &#34;Jan 1 00:00:00 1970&#34; --duration=1000000h

// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:
//
//  {
//      &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;MyAPIObject&#34;,
//      &#34;apiVersion&#34;:&#34;v1&#34;,
//      &#34;myPlugin&#34;: {
//          &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;PluginA&#34;,
//          &#34;aOption&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;,
//      },
//  }
</code></pre>
<p>This reformatting makes the meaning clearer as well as making the doc comments
render correctly in earlier versions of Go.
If the heuristic ever makes a bad decision, it can be overridden by inserting
a blank line to clearly separate the paragraph text from non-paragraph text.</p>
<p>Even with these heuristics, other existing comments will need manual
adjustment to correct their rendering.
The most common mistake is indenting a wrapped unindented line of text.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO Revisit this design. It may make sense to walk those nodes
//      only once.

// According to the document:
// &#34;The alignment factor (in bytes) that is used to align the raw data of sections in
//  the image file. The value should be a power of 2 between 512 and 64 K, inclusive.&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>In both of these, the last line is indented, making it a code block.
The fix is to unindent the lines.</p>
<p>Another common mistake is not indenting a wrapped indented line of a list or code block.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Uses of this error model include:
//
//   - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the
// client,
//     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the
// partial
//     errors.
//
//   - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step
// may
//     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
</code></pre>
<p>The fix is to indent the wrapped lines.</p>
<p>Go doc comments do not support nested lists, so gofmt reformats</p>
<pre><code>// Here is a list:
//
//  - Item 1.
//    * Subitem 1.
//    * Subitem 2.
//  - Item 2.
//  - Item 3.
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>// Here is a list:
//
//  - Item 1.
//  - Subitem 1.
//  - Subitem 2.
//  - Item 2.
//  - Item 3.
</code></pre>
<p>Rewriting the text to avoid nested lists usually
improves the documentation and is the best solution.
Another potential workaround is to mix list markers,
since bullet markers do not introduce list items in a numbered list,
nor vice versa.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Here is a list:
//
//  1. Item 1.
//
//     - Subitem 1.
//
//     - Subitem 2.
//
//  2. Item 2.
//
//  3. Item 3.
</code></pre>
