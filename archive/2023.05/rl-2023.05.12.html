The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum’s friend’s house, into which she had disappeared. “Won’t be long,” she’d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it.</span></p><p>Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag – minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam.</p><p>I was in trouble, of course – but I was not convinced that I’d done anything wrong. Instead it was as though, in putting an end to that desperate boredom, I had narrowly escaped falling off some kind of precipice – and I knew I would do whatever it took to avoid going over the edge in future.</p><p>I did not understand then – two decades before my first conference call or doctor’s waiting room – that boredom was a fact of life no more avoidable than any other mental state, good or bad. At times, it may even be a dominant experience. Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline, hitting the floor in one’s 50s. But though boredom may be less prominent in middle life, it is still present – evidence suggests it comes creeping back in your 60s, especially among women.</p><figure id="1fa9b4e4-069d-4e1f-b196-afbff8348486" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="illustration of a man lying on his back, one leg bent, a pensive finger at his chin" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.0941300898995" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline again.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>It is a familiar feeling and very common. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a “boom time for boredom”. Most of us are poorly equipped to cope with being shut in our homes indefinitely, even with the internet to distract us.</p><p>But we should not fear being bored, say psychologists James Danckert and John D Eastwood, the authors of <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/out-of-my-skull-9780674984677.html" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom</a></em>. Their research has revealed boredom to be widely misunderstood, perhaps even unfairly maligned. Boredom evolved to help us, says Danckert. It signals that we are unengaged, in need of an activity to satisfy us. “I think that’s a good thing, in a lot of ways. How we respond to it is up to us. I think you can minimise it. But do you want to totally eliminate it? I don’t think you do.”</p><p>Danckert and Eastwood contend that boredom can steer us towards realising our potential and living full, meaningful lives. They say it communicates an important message that – in trying to outrun it my entire life – I had been refusing to heed.</p><p>What if I stopped and listened?</p><p><em><strong>Danckert is an Australian</strong></em> cognitive neuroscientist now based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He began studying boredom 15 years ago, a case of “physician, heal thyself,” he says. “As a kid, and still into my adult years, I experience boredom, and whenever I do, I hate it. I find it a very frustrating, agitating experience.”</p><p>This isn’t a new phenomenon. To quote from <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/26/boredom-lively-history-toohey-review" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Boredom: A Lively History</a></em>, by the classicist Peter Toohey, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote in disgust: “How long the same things? Surely I will yawn, I will sleep, I will eat, I will be thirsty, I will be cold, I will be hot. Is there no end?” In the Middle Ages monks complained of “the noonday demon”: the personification of acedia – torpor, alongside agitation – provoked by the constraints and repetition of their daily lives. And though one could already be “a bore”, it was Dickens who was the first to term it “boredom” – in <em>Bleak House</em> in 1852. Lady Dedlock complains of being “bored to death” of herself, more than a century before Bruce Springsteen would express the same restless dissatisfaction in Dancing in the Dark. His characterisation of boredom as a frustrated hunger (“I’m just about starving tonight”) evokes Tolstoy’s definition in <em>Anna Karenina</em> of the feeling as “the desire for desires”.</p><figure id="a08c3a85-2a5f-4d0f-8a72-1f06eca470b5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Couple sitting on a sofa both engaged on their phones" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.0998504113687" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Boredom is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>“Boredom is such a fascinating topic, with tentacles that spread into philosophy, anthropology, literature, religion, theology,” says Eastwood, who is head of the <a href="http://boredomlab.org/" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Boredom Lab </a>at York University in Toronto. There researchers study boredom from social, clinical and cognitive perspectives – from shoring up the link with creativity and improving outcomes in education, to better understanding the subjective experience of mental exertion and attention – with a view to applying their findings in the real world. “But as a scientist, I wasn’t convinced that everybody was using the term in the same way.”</p><p>Eastwood became interested in boredom 20 years ago, after observing a seeming “crisis of agency” among young men he saw in his private psychotherapy practice. They were disengaged, under-achieving, perhaps abusing marijuana or struggling with depression, he says. Eastwood characterises their circumstance as a “failure to launch into life”, which these men told him they experienced as “being chronically bored”. But what was being bored, exactly? “I thought: what is this?”</p><p>In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, he and Danckert define boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of “wanting to do something, but not wanting to do anything”. It is not an emotion, as such, but an ongoing cognitive process where we wish to engage our minds, but nothing seems to satisfy. It is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.</p><p>It is this particular combination of lethargy and restlessness that distinguishes boredom from frustration (where a specific desire has been thwarted) and apathy (where there is no desire at all). And though boredom seems to be a risk factor for depression, it is not the same. To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity. “Only boring people get bored,” goes the aphorism. “I’m highly motivated to prove it’s not true,” jokes Danckert.</p><p>It is when we fail to act on the signal, or succumb to distractions, that the feeling of boredom becomes protracted and causes us misery. As the Booker prize winner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-enright" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Anne Enright</a> wrote recently: “Boredom is a productive state, so long as you don’t let it go sour on you.” It is striking that the predisposition to it is negatively perceived in a way that other personality traits aren’t. Complaints of “I’m bored” are often seen as uniquely provoking, Eastwood notes. “There is this impulse in us to say, ‘There’s something wrong with you, you should not be bored.’ But to simply judge them, I think, misses the point. They know there’s things to do – but they can’t bring their desires in the moment in line with what’s there.”</p><figure id="af4520ea-9bcf-4df1-9a4d-a43e5b73957f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Illustration of a girl sitting on the ground looking bored" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.10604706583257" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Some people are better equipped to cope than others. In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, the psychologists compare two astronauts who responded very differently to the constraints and monotony of space exploration. Russia’s Valentin Lebedev, who spent 211 days in space in the early 1980s, failed to be satisfied by the busy work dictated by ground control and, after five months, did not “even want to look out of a porthole”. As commander of the International Space Station in 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield found purpose even in plumbing repairs. The psychologists suggest it was Hadfield’s intrinsic motivation to find meaning in what he was doing, and to occupy and challenge himself within the confines of his environment, that set the two astronauts apart. Hadfield claims to never be bored – but, Danckert says, it’s more that “he just deals with it really very well”.</p><p><em><strong>In the years after</strong></em> I tore apart Mum’s car, I got better at not being bored, even in testing conditions. My parents are enthusiastic sailors and most of my school holidays were spent in the close confines of their yacht, without television or internet, during sometimes long passages at sea.</p><p>On those trips I read every book on board, regardless of interest (a dictionary; a medical encyclopaedia) or age appropriateness (pulpy Dick Francis thrillers, replete with rumpy-pumpy); and when I ran out of other people’s stories, I wrote my own. I spent long periods listening to the same music. At a push, I could be alone with my thoughts, observing them with slight indifference, as though they were a TV show that had not yet hooked me.</p><p>I considered this evidence of my extreme aversion to boredom. In fact, according to Danckert and Eastwood, I may just have developed a good response to it. Though it has not been substantiated by research, they suggest that boredom has been the push for much creativity, innovation and growth – while simultaneously a source of distress for many.</p><p>The mistake many people make is seeking to escape the uncomfortable feeling, instead of interrogating what it is trying to tell them, says Eastwood. They may distract themselves with social media, or worse: boredom has also been shown to be a factor in unhealthy eating, as well as use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.</p><figure id="1ed5ee08-7646-4655-a550-9df75b750565" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Illustration of a man twiddling his thumbs" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="727.6440177252585" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Boredom is a call to action, but many of us choose not to hear it.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>In relying on external solutions, we undermine our sense of ourselves as the authors of our own lives, and the problem may become chronic. In young people, boredom is associated with higher than average risk-taking; in the elderly, it can speed up the degenerative process of ageing. Both groups are at particular risk of depression, for which boredom is a precursor.</p><p>Boredom-prone people also experience higher levels of anger, aggression and hostility and may be driven to look for meaning in extreme political views, or tribalism. To Danckert, that means boredom may be one part of our ever more polarised politics and public discourse. “When you’re in the midst of an overload of information, one response is to shout louder,” he says. Sociologist Orrin Klapp, writing in 1986, called it “ego-screaming” and that “perfectly captures Twitter trolling,” says Danckert.</p><p>The fact that our response to boredom is often destructive, adversarial or otherwise problematic speaks to just how deeply uncomfortable we find the sensation. A 2014 study found that many people chose to administer painful electric shocks to themselves rather than being left alone with their thoughts. One man shocked himself 190 times in 15 minutes.</p><p>“All too often when we’re bored, we see ourselves as passive, empty vessels to fill – we look for stimuli that will get rid of the bad feeling in the short term,” says Eastwood. “But it doesn’t foster and grow our capacity for agency – and that’s exactly what we need to be free from boredom and its negative consequences.”</p><p><em><strong>Danckert and Eastwood</strong></em> are reluctant to blame the present problem on our preoccupation with technology alone. But it is true that tech presents us with a powerful distraction. If the goal is to simply avoid being bored, it may be easier now than ever, what with the infinite scroll of social media, endless hours of entertainment on Netflix and Spotify, and all our friends always available.</p><p>But this over-abundance of things to do itself can exacerbate boredom. Eastwood evokes the “paradox of choice”, saying “options are not necessarily freeing and do not necessarily make us happy”. Seeking relief on the internet “can feel like trying to drink from a fire hose” Danckert and Eastwood write. Not only that, in hijacking our attention, technology may, over time, compound the issue it seems to alleviate. “It takes time and attention to scroll through Instagram or play Candy Crush, but at the end of it, you’re not satisfied, because you didn’t do the harder work of figuring out: ‘What do I really want to do?’ It’s a vicious cycle: you got some engagement, but it wasn’t the thing you needed,” says Danckert. That is the challenge that boredom lays down, he says: “to figure out what is going to be meaningful and useful to you in your life”.</p><p>Becoming better attuned to our own inner states can allay the discomfort and illuminate a satisfying course of action. Mindfulness, which fosters a non-judgmental response to one’s thoughts (as I now know I practised on my parents’ boat), has been linked to lower levels of boredom. Danckert lets his mind wander on his three-mile walk to work , thinking of “the dumbest things – but it is engaging to just follow those threads and see where they lead you”.</p><p>Eastwood’s own ritual is making time to sit and think, with a cup of tea – a period of “constructive internal reflection”, during which he connects with his internal compass. Uncomfortable feelings steer us for the better, he says. “Just as it’s good that we have the capacity for pain, to keep us safe, it’s good that we have the capacity for boredom, because it saves us from the ruin of stagnation. It keeps us moving forward and searching for a better way of applying ourselves, for engaging in the world.”</p><p>Received in that spirit, boredom can be a call to action – but many of us choose not to hear it. Wincing, I admit to Danckert that I have opened Twitter, scrolled for a while, become bored with scrolling, closed Twitter, then immediately opened Twitter again, almost instinctively. I do this embarrassingly often, I tell him – it’s just easier to push through boredom on the internet, rather than taking it as a cue to log off.</p><p>Danckert reiterates, not without sympathy, I think, that at moments like that it is better to “just do something”. It does not necessarily have to align with some higher purpose in life – simply putting down my phone will break the cycle of unsatisfying engagement, and reinforce my own sense of my autonomy.</p><p>Within weeks of our interview, a global pandemic takes hold, and I count myself lucky to just be bored. Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over. I spend less time on my phone. I read my flatmate’s books that have rested on our communal shelf for years without ever piquing my curiosity. I bake, for the first time since childhood. Constraints that might have been boring are in fact oddly motivational.</p><p>As Danckert and Eastwood write in <em>Out of My Skull</em>, when we are “constantly carried along by a fast-moving stream, we can forget how to swim for ourselves”. It is this that boredom seeks to remind us of, they suggest – that we are the authors of our lives, even now they’ve been derailed.</p><figure id="b1faaa24-95cd-4d98-89ad-e5e75a32dd3b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Illustration of a girl, sitting on the floor, using her phone" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.1415319374503" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over.’</span> Illustration: L.hunt/The Observer</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-to-avoid-boredom">How to avoid boredom</h2><p><strong>1. Don’t fight the feeling.</strong> Boredom is uncomfortable, but you make it worse by layering suffering on top. Think of when you twist your ankle – you feel pain without berating yourself for being clumsy, or fretting about a chronic injury. Feeling bored is unavoidable, but it is not a judgment on your character or ability.</p><p><strong>2. Create a new routine.</strong> Boredom flourishes within constraints. In the absence of ordinary routines and busyness, it may feel like you are stagnating. Try to find another gear – one that may not be as high-energy, or productive, but is full at the same time.</p><p><strong>3. Find purpose.</strong> Boredom is not an absence of things to do, it is the struggle to find value in any of the options available to you. Being able to connect with a reason “why” for doing something (including quarantine) can make it less boring. Instead of agitating for anything to do, try to determine what’s really important – whether right now, or for the future.</p><p><strong>4. Avoid passive consumption.</strong> It is all too easy to binge Netflix or scroll social media. If you’re enjoying yourself, there’s no problem, but treating yourself as a passive consumer may mean you are more likely to feel bored. You need to feel engaged.</p><p><em>Out of My Skull (Harvard University Press, £22.95) is </em><em>out in June</em><em>.

<blockquote><p>
I’m rewriting <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-business/">The Business</a> for the next book. This piece is almost 15 years old, much has changed in negotiating an offer letter, and I have more advice on how to analyze those offers. So much advice that I am idea paralyzed™ trying to rewrite this piece.</p>
<p>So, this is just a section of the update to The Business, which I’ll be grafting onto the new version.  Given this approach, there’s an entire introduction that I’m assuming you’ve read, but here’s your cheat sheet for now: you’ve just received an offer from my hypothetical company.</p>
<p>And scene.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then we have the conversation. It’s either you and I or you and the recruiter. We present the offer’s details and explain each part of your compensation package. When we’re done, there is a short pause because that was a lot of information. You might take a moment, take a day, but you eventually come back and say something like, “I’d like more base salary.”</p>
<p>No problem. Of course, we’re expecting negotiation. Of course. We don’t know which part of the package you’ll want to negotiate, but unless we’ve pre-negotiated the offer as part of the interview process (it happens), we always expect a response. However, your response will always receive a response. We are going to ask some form of “Why do you want a higher base salary?”</p>
<p>“It just feels fair.”</p>
<p>If you’ve been a hiring manager and received this type of justification, I want you first to take a deep breath. It does read… unhelpful, but there is a signal there, and it’s not the word you think. More on this shortly.</p>
<p>Let’s start with one word: fair. What might this mean? Fair could mean “fair compared to other similar companies with similar job levels.”</p>
<p>Right, so you know that the job of Engineer 3 at my Company is the same as a Senior Engineer at Company XYZ. Furthermore, you know the salary ranges for Engineer 3 and Senior Engineer are roughly equivalent. Finally, you have a friend who recently received an offer at Company XYZ for Senior Engineer, and you believe that you and your friend have the same experience.</p>
<p>First, I want to acknowledge that you’ve done this research, and having this data at the ready is a good thing. I want you to do more of this work because that is the entire point of this chapter, but right now, I want to talk about your single data point and how little it tells you in this scenario.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are these job levels the same? What does that even mean? Are you saying these two companies value precisely the same skills and experience in the same way? That seems unlikely. But, ok…</li>
<li>Are you suggesting the salary ranges for these jobs are the same in different companies? <a href="https://radford.aon.com/products/surveys">There are companies</a> out there who do market research to determine how much companies are paying individuals at different levels, and this is interesting data, but how do these research levels apply to the levels at my company? Also, how much time had passed between when this research was done and manifested in the salary range for this level? High-tech hires aggressively, and salary ranges are often adjusted to make Company A more attractive than Company B.  But, ok…</li>
<li>How big is your friend’s company? Is it big? Is your data point from precisely the same team? No? Is it a different team? Are they beholden to the same salary guidelines and philosophy as your offer? Are you sure? The bigger the company, the more different executives land different compensation philosophies. Some teams are eager to hire and increase offers to make them more attractive. Other teams recognize that varying compensation philosophies are fundamentally unfair and go to extreme lengths to ensure all candidates receive the same offer for the same job for candidates with the same experience. But, ok…</li>
<li>Is your data point from your friend’s company at a different growth stage? How do you even compare your big company offer, primarily stock, to a big public company offer, which is a knowable blend of base salary, bonus, and publicly traded stock, to a start-up where the stock is a mostly unknown quantity, and they’re trying to conserve cash?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your single data point tells you the data from one other talented individual and how one other company values their ability. Unless your offer is from the same company for the same role on the same team, deltas just in base salary aren’t anything other than expected. Big deltas. Thousands of dollars deltas. Single data points are not apple-to-apple comparisons.</p>
<p>My point of this breakdown is to give you context. The factors that go into the construction of an offer are many. Some of these are easy to discern, and some are tucked away in the values of biases of a company.</p>
<p>But fair isn’t really what I see in “It just feels fair.” What I read is, “But I want more.” More is good. Who doesn’t want more? I sure do. It’s not your best work, but there is a glimmer of a goal in this awkwardly simple sentence. It would be best if you were striving for more in your new role, but I think your job goals needs more definition, so I’ll tell you mine…</p>

<p>I want a <strong>better</strong> job. I want a role providing me with challenges I have not seen before. I want to work with a diverse and talented team that, by just existing, teaches me new ideas and makes me better. I want a better company that has figured itself out and is heading, no, charging towards building the next thing.</p>
<p>I want to move <strong>faster</strong> in my career. I have been doing the same thing for the last three years, and I feel my career is decelerating because my daily learnings are decreasing over time. I always have the next goal for my career, and I want to have a job accelerating me towards that goal by providing me with new opportunities with new humans on different products. The speed with which I’m heading toward the next goal should be… breathtaking.</p>
<p>I want <strong>more</strong>. More accountability means more potential for the products I’ll be building. More visibility into how the product is built and how the company is shaped to support building the product. More features that help more humans.</p>
<p>You will note that nothing I listed under my Better, Faster, and More job goals mentions compensation. This is not because compensation isn’t essential; it’s because the things that will matter most in your next job have very little to do with how you are paid. We gravitate towards compensation as the measure for the next gig because it’s so wonderfully measurable and comparable. However, who you work with, how you build, and what you build are aspects of the job you should be assessing.</p>
<p>But how? There are no structured rubrics for evaluating and comparing people, processes, and products. This is why the best word in your response is “feel”. I know your feelings about the compensation, but how do you feel about the humans you will be working with? How do feel about how they work together? How do you feel about what they build and where they are going?</p>
<p>Feelings are observations collected, compiled into opinions, and finally transformed into an emotion. I want you to feel your offer is fair, but I want you to feel this is a fantastic opportunity for you to grow.</p>

Often that means lessening the burden of the emotion because you realize it&#39;s &#34;just X&#34;.</p><p>For example, a couple of years ago I started to have panic attacks when ruminating about weird things like the infinite vacuum of space, the simulation hypothesis, the nature of sensory signals, etc. Then I thought about why I would get scared and how I felt that fear, and realized it was because I was scared of being disconnected - essentially afraid of being alone. I recognize that as the true fear, and it&#39;s a lot easier to manage than &#34;nothing is real and nothing makes sense&#34;, which is essentially just my imagination extending that base fear.</p><p>Of course the truth is that the pandemic era caused a lot of alienation, created deeper political and cultural rifts, and destabilized the entire world. That&#39;s my actual situation, so it&#39;s no wonder I feel that way, and I can address it however I see fit.</p><p>It&#39;s a way to ground yourself and break out of things that hold you back mentally.

A person having to hustle with two jobs because that’s the only way that she can afford child care or to pay down student debt doesn’t get much help from being told: “you’re sad because you’re being materially exploited”.<p>There’s almost nothing that that person can do to improve her situation in the near term. As such, many of those people deliberately choose to ignore said material realities. The great lines from Pulp’s “Common people” are an example of this attitude:</p><p>&gt; You&#39;ll never watch your life slide out of view</p><p>&gt; And you dance and drink and screw</p><p>&gt; Because there&#39;s nothing else to do

That&#39;s first-order emotional suffering.</p><p>Then there are the emotional pathologies that develop on top of that, the second-order emotional suffering, and that can be treated by therapy. For example, if you&#39;re miserable because you&#39;re poor, therapy won&#39;t help solve the anguish and stress of making rent, but it can solve second-order emotions like feelings of shame and self-hatred. Or if you have a life altering accident, it won&#39;t solve the baseline misery dealt by the terrible life consequences, but it can help with the residual panic attacks from the trauma of the accident.

I was poor growing up by American standards, and that is a different bar.</p><p>I’m curious about your take on this - 
Someone being able to enjoy their kids growing up, or see the value they bring to the people in their lives, or feel the importance in their role in keeping everyone alive, is a large part of my definition of happiness. It goes more towards ‘contentment’? Or purpose.</p><p>It includes processing the hard things, and finding the value in getting through them too, and the feeling of being good at what someone does and who they are.</p><p>For others, their definition of happy is the excited state of enjoyment (laughing, glee, etc).</p><p>For most, it’s a mix of the two.</p><p>Near as I can tell, getting rich often requires a significant degree of not being reasonable or content with the status quo. Sometimes ‘getting rich’ here is more about not being poor. Sometimes, it can be ‘there is never enough’.</p><p>Being content for someone in that state can happen of course, and after someone gets to a certain degree of wealth, tools to make it easier to get or maintain it are more readily available, but so are tools to hurt oneself.  I’ve seen a lot of people hurt themselves on this front over the years.</p><p>A lot of the contentment elements here are also quite difficult to feel productively  for someone with material wealth.  Mucking out a chicken coop because it’s nasty and you need healthy chickens to survive is a very concrete thing with a clear chain from ‘problem’ to ‘solved’.</p><p>Trying to get Alpha out of stocks is not.

By forcing yourself to study it, you need to step outside of its bounds, separating the <i>you</i> from the emotion itself. That distance you have created and held for a few moments is a welcome relief and often makes it apparent that you are a separate entity from your pain. The further away you are from it, the less painful it is. And the more you look at it, the weaker it seems. At the end of the exercise you are more aware that whatever tormenting you was just a fleeting moment with little power over you.</p><p>I find it is a brilliant and incredibly powerful concept to internalise. You can find this is the exact idea expressed in stuff like Dune&#39;s Litany Against Fear (by reciting it, you are visualizing your fear as a third party, outside of you), or meditation (remaining a passive observer to your thoughts)

Doesn&#39;t always work and not everybody walks away happy, but they&#39;re generally satisfied with at least being heard.

I am much more aware of my posture and breathing for years of running, yoga and weightlifting.

It&#39;s from _Your Resonant Self_ by Sarah Peyton. Warning, it&#39;s self-helpy, yup.<p>It&#39;s interesting to me that you think focusing on your emotions might be a way to distract ourselves, it makes me curious about distract ourselves from <i>what</i>? I think some people find they actually spend a lot of time distracting themselves from their emotions, so naming and describing and locating their emotions is kind of the opposite of distracting themselves. (But distracting yourself can be a fine thing and useful coping mechanism too; in fact Peyton includes &#34;distraction&#34; as a method of &#34;self-regulation&#34; in the same section on &#34;self-regulation&#34; I&#39;m about to quote from. but, I think, a different thing than naming emotions).</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m no expert and I&#39;m not trying to convince you, if it&#39;s not something that seems to resonate with you, then maybe it&#39;s not for you, right now anyway. But since you asked, I figured I&#39;d post an excerpt from the thing I was just reading that touched on what you are asking about, in a way that really struck me -- although I don&#39;t know if just these few paragraphs will be as striking as the whole book so far as been on me!</p><p>&gt; If you have doubts that talking about feelings will help you, you are in good company. Research shows that most people don&#39;t believe that putting words to emotions helps at all. People don&#39;t think that it makes things better to name what&#39;s happening, even though the effectiveness of that approach can be seen with fMRI. Perhaps this is because many people cope by paying no attention to their emotions or their bodies and the naming of feelings is unfamiliar and thus uncomfortable. But the experience of naming what is happening not only works to calm us down; when it is done with a caring other it can also create relationships of warmth and trust, no matter how old we are. Bringing these relationships inside (importing them into our own brain and carrying them there as a memory) helps people feel more secure in the world. This can have unexpected long-term benefits, including improving immune system function; the sense of meaning and purpose in life; resiliency in the face of trauma, depression or posttraumatic stress; and relationships with others and with ourselves…</p><p>&gt; …Putting words to inner experience is helpful in another way, too. When people can&#39;t read the messages being sent by the body, they are in what scientists call alexithymia, or body blindness. Did you ever meet anyone who was stressed out and angry but didn&#39;t seem to realize it? They might not even have known that they had an increased heart rate or tension in their belly or that their eyebrows were pulling together. These people have a hard time knowing what their emotions are, let alone being able to talk about them. When people don&#39;t know what they are feeling, there&#39;s nothing they can do to remedy the situation. People who are body-blind show increased stress on their immune system and have a harder time with their relationships. There is also a link between being body-blind and being depressed. These people also suffer more from posttraumatic stress, and some research even shows that they have shorter lives.</p><p>&gt; To sum up, developing a conscious practice of naming emotions is one of the sweeteest and most counterintuitive forms of self-regulation (in which the brain takes care of itself without accessing external behaviors or substances, as opposed to self-management, which uses work-arounds such as addictions). When naming emotions is done with warmth, it can foster the mothering relationship between the prefrontal cortex  and the amygdala that securely attached children receive from their childhoods. Happily, as people start to name what is happening, they can learn to accompany themselves through emotional experience and support themselves and their immune systems while doing so.

I&#39;m not sure if our personalities drew us to similar places on the internet, or if we were sort of fostered into a similar set of personalities because of the nature of these environments and cultures.</p><p>My best effort to define this vague sort of culture / personality / ideology is a sort of radical valuing of the truth, and seeking truth in all things.</p><p>&gt; Sure it&#39;s rude to call him fat, but if I was fat I&#39;d want someone to tell me, how are we supposed to get better if we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with us?</p><p>&gt; Depression is bullshit, everyone feels sad, you&#39;re gonna pay a psychologist 200 bucks an hour to tell you that?

I would see people being really supportive and roll my eyes. &#34;Yeah right, secretly they hate eachother / judge eachother. Take food away from both of them for just two days and watch how quickly they&#39;ll stab eachother in the back.&#34;</p><p>Again, this is not me describing you, your comment just happened to remind me of how I used to be. Looking back, I don&#39;t understand why I was so full of hate, judgement, and arrogance. I really believed that the happy people HAD to be lying about it, because I wasn&#39;t happy. I really believed everyone was secretly judging eachother, cause that&#39;s what I was doing. I really believed that various psychological techniques just had to be total bullshit, because I never genuinely tried them in good faith, and just assumed they were konk science.</p><p>I learned over time that being aware of my feelings was important and difficult, and that the various strategies I assumed were bullshit (like the ones in this post) actually can be interesting and effective ways to learn more about myself, if I set aside my anger, hatred, judgement, and genuinely tried them. I realized I was carrying a LOT of anger around, some of it directed at me for having insanely high standards for myself, my morals and values, and my failure to live those standards out perfectly, a lot of it directed outwards at other people for not being the way I thought people should be.</p><p>Regardless, activities like this, silly though they may be, were all tools in a toolbelt of self discovery. As a general rule I&#39;ve learned that new skills and experiences are earned through discomfort or suffering of some kind, and thus naturally to develop myself, my Mind, my personality, I had to suffer through some stuff I really thought was just so stupid, and some of it I still do, but I try to keep an open mind and do genuinely find myself surprised at what I learn when trying these things out.</p><p>If I stop assuming I already have all the answers and give an earnest and good faith try to some of this stuff, I learn. That&#39;s basically the TLDR.

Since last night been chewing on a blog post on the idea.<p>The long work was I read a lot of philosophy and talked to a lot of people, but there&#39;s two critical things I think caused me to dramatically shift my direction and perspective: first, I read &#34;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#34; by Dale Carnegie. It was a good first start to an open mind because his writing style is something I&#39;d put on the list above, but, I was convinced by his research and experience that what he was writing about in terms of managing human relationships was effective, and I wanted to be effective, so I resolved to grit my teeth and try his ideas. They primarily resolved around empathy and letting go of pride, so the behavior necessary was the opposite of my running theory of how to live.</p><p>Second was I started dating a girl that was also basically the opposite of my personality and some of my interpersonal values. She was basically the nicest person at my university, the least selfish person still that I&#39;ve ever met, and because we were dating I got to see again and again that nope, it really was genuine, she really did just feel and act that way. I&#39;d interrogate her about it and she&#39;d put up with it, telling me she didn&#39;t really have an ulterior motive, she just felt that&#39;s how she wanted to behave. Likely because of how she behaved she was by far and away one of the most well known people in our slice of university life and enormously successful in all things she did, and last I heard that continues in her current life somewhere buried inside the USA government. Thinking on this, my experience with her could probably be replicated by finding someone suspiciously selfless and trying to talk to them about it, maybe befriend them.</p><p>I was ambitious and had high standards for myself so I thought ok, apparently high empathy, selfless strategies get phenomenal results, I wanna be a Big Successful Business Guy, I need to try this, even if I&#39;m faking it. But faking putting yourself in someone else&#39;s shoes is just putting yourself in someone else&#39;s shoes. I found myself very very slowly saying yes to more things, sometimes because I was being a sly little experimenter in the project, sometimes just surprising myself with a new interest.</p><p>The more stuff I tried the more stuff I found to be effective at achieving things for myself. Meditation, for example. I tried it enough to learn about it, then one night out in a field at my friend&#39;s ranch when we were all laying about looking at the starts I did the breathing technique someone had shown me and went through the exercise, and never again have I been as relaxed or calm as i was that night. So that&#39;s a good feeling, that I enjoyed, and forced me to recognize that meditation can be a good thing.</p><p>That superdense period of personal epoch shifting was basically all of college, 4 years. There were some stunts abroad, including a year after college where my ugly personality caused me to tremendously fail at a job I was brought out to Taiwan for, that probably contributed a lot to the journey.</p><p>Since the &#34;unlocking&#34; of empathy it&#39;s just been more and more times where when I bother to learn someone&#39;s perspective and feelings, I&#39;m finding myself understand and emphathising (&#34;I&#39;ve felt that&#34;) or at least sympathizing (&#34;I haven&#39;t felt that but I can understand why in that situation someone might&#34;). So it&#39;s been a journey now of I guess nearly ten years.</p><p>Now I&#39;ve read a great deal of philosophy and participated in some direct action and have a logical and ethical basis for living this way and thinking this way. I feel as strongly on the side of empathy now as I previously thought it was bullshit, but I&#39;m happy I&#39;m a skeptical person because my position was hard-fought, 
and I can be confident in the basis for it (using logic, deduction, evidence, etc). Skepticism isn&#39;t inherently bad, it just means you need some convincing, and imo that can be good because it can lead to better formed, more well researched, more effective positions.</p><p>Btw the other poster said drugs so just throwing it out there that I&#39;ve never done anything more than some weed and alcohol so don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for changing ones fundamental perspective, though, I have heard plenty of similar stories about this, particular regarding shrooms.</p><p>Edit: now I&#39;m thinking on it more and I also feel like just not being surrounded by people who are all reinforcing this depressive skepticism was probably important. Like on 4chan if you dared show hope or be happy you&#39;d be mocked relentlessly. The attitude had to be aloof and mercilessly aggrandizing or you wouldn&#39;t survive. It was similar in my friend group before college. We told each other we were toughening each other up, and I don&#39;t regret it because I&#39;ve been able to transform it into a healthy way of not taking myself too seriously.</p><p>But anyway by being with people with whom I can actually have these conversations without being mocked, it makes a difference. Note here that we&#39;re getting a generally positive reaction to sharing our thoughts. If we were being downvoted and mocked, there&#39;d be no room for learning or change.</p><p>Back in college the force of my skeptical personality was likely so strong that even empathetic people would probably be forced to react with caution to avoid pain from my lashing out at them. Barriers go up when you&#39;re hella toxic. I&#39;m chewing on the idea.

There can be very good reasons that people have turned off the part of their brain that tells them about their body&#39;s emotional response to the world. If a person&#39;s skull-brain has no way to respond to messages from the body-brain (for example, if the burning, bubbling, cramping, twisting sensations that come with intense emotions have never been acknowledged, or if every one of these unchanging sensations feels like a driving hunger or a craving for an addictive substance), then a person may need to learn to ignore the body-brain. In other words, if emotions are an unbearable trip to unrecoverable emotional hell, then turning off body sensations can help people manage their world. It can be a solid survival strategy to have no idea what is happening in the body. Connection with the body can be unendurable. So it is important to take this journey slowly and acknolwedge that reading about this information may seem simple and unemotional but can awaken old trauma and restimulate old pain.</p><p>&gt; If you find this to be true for you, slow down. If we move slowly enough, we can simultaneously build a capacity for resonant, calming response at the same time that we awaken the voice of the body.

What kind of life is that?</p><p>I&#39;m doing okay nowadays in part because I&#39;ve managed to shove my emotions out of the way once I acknowledge they&#39;re only a signal to a real problem that I can either do something about or I can do absolutely nothing about, and once that&#39;s determined the emotion as a signal is useless and knowing that helps me set it aside and focus on what I want in life and determining a purpose. But that practice of dwelling on my emotions and reflecting on &#34;how I felt&#34; held me back for a long time, and that&#39;s why I had the need to comment at all. While this kind of thing may help a lot of people it&#39;s important for some to hear &#34;yeah this might not work for you at all, might even be worse, don&#39;t waste time if it doesn&#39;t work for you, there are other ways&#34;.

I&#39;ve done therapy on and off (sometimes reactively, like after my Dad died; sometimes a little more pro-actively, like when I had a brutal case of writer&#39;s block during my dissertation prospectus). Never anything I would rate as very serious or urgent. I would say the therapy was not un-useful, in the sense that I didn&#39;t mind taking time out of my day to talk to someone. But I also basically felt like the eventual remediation mostly just stemmed from the acute phase passing or steps I took outside therapy. The thing that got me over my writer&#39;s block was mostly writing. The thing that helped me deal with my Dad dying was mostly more time passing and my life moving on.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have noticed that a lot of people in my life with higher distress loads, and particularly people like the author of this piece who report suffering from fairly serious mental illness, invest a lot of resources into self-help. I think that&#39;s a good instinct, to say &#34;I have a problem and this is a tool that will help fix it&#34;, analogous to seeking medical care for a physical ailment. But my experience is that the vast majority of those people seem to make little apparent progress via self-help, and instead typically continue to report being extremely distressed (though, punctuated with confessionals about how much better things are). For most people levels of distress in life seem to me to be primarily associated with lifelong, or early socialized dispositions; or with major material facts of life (i.e. single/married, broke/affluent, healthy/sick, undergoing a major life change/being severely stuck/doing fine) rather than the particular steps they take to manage or mitigate it. That doesn&#39;t mean therapy doesn&#39;t work, because maybe the counterfactual is they would have gotten much worse absent therapy.</p><p>A few friends from when I was a teenager, people who really struggled with severely gnarly upbringings, abuse, broken homes, early life drug dependency, etc. even went into becoming therapists or social workers. And the strange thing is, it externally seems to me like they&#39;re about as troubled as they were 20+ years ago, modulo having a little more money.</p><p>I guess I would distinguish a lot of these cases from people who are acutely suicidal, people who are actively seeking drug rehabilitation, etc. There seems to be at least some evidence for intervention in those cases. But I am talking about the kind of cases I think you&#39;re talking about.</p><p>So to your broader point, despite again the fact that it&#39;s expressed a bit stridently, I think there&#39;s something there: the evangelism about self-help&#39;s benefits often seems to outstrip self-help&#39;s apparent benefits. There&#39;s probably some element where part of therapy is basically tricking your brain, so the apparent sentiment of someone who is clearly having a hard time beaming about how much better they&#39;re doing might be part of the plan anyway. But externally it can feel jarring to hear &#34;I&#39;m really turning a corner!!!&#34; from someone who&#39;s been struggling for years and continues to struggle.

I now work through the problems in my life in the order in which they cause more problems, and it benefits me in lots of little ways.<p>It&#39;s relevant to the discussion that I think the notion that everyone needs therapy and medication is absurd.
