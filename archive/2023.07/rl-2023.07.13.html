                  <p>While it is always preferable to have a randomized control group, this is less critical in the early stages of intervention development. The current study was an initial efficacy study where we were piloting a new intervention. As described in the “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Sec1">Introduction</a>” section above, based on the ORBIT model, studies testing the development of a new intervention are encouraged to use a socio-demographically similar comparison group. Because our group class format required enrolling women at the same stage of pregnancy, it was difficult to recruit sufficient numbers for a wave, and it would have been problematic to use only half for the treatment group, given the desired group class size of 10 women. Therefore, women unable to attend intervention classes due to their schedules, or women with gestational age of 20–23 weeks who otherwise met the eligibility criteria, were eligible for being part of the “Treatment As Usual” (TAU) group<b>.</b> The treatment as usual included whatever prenatal medical care the individuals received on their own. Therefore, both the treatment group and the TAU group received medical care as usual, with the only difference being that the treatment group received the MMT classes as well. Due to this recruitment design, the TAU group had slightly later gestational age than the intervention group, a limitation addressed in the discussion.</p>
                <h3 id="Sec5">Study Design</h3><p>Participants were asked to complete study questionnaires regarding psychological distress, eating behavior, and exercise at baseline and 8 weeks later (post-intervention). Participants were paid $25 for completing the measurement battery. Participants in the intervention were additionally compensated $25 for attending each session to help cover their time, transportation, and any childcare. After delivery, medical records were reviewed by trained research assistants to confirm pre-pregnancy BMI, when possible, and gestational age, assess total gestational weight gain based on pre-pregnancy BMI, code medical complications, and assess which participants may have developed gestational diabetes (based on glucose levels from the OGTT). Women in the MMT group came in person for their baseline assessment, but TAU did not.</p><h3 id="Sec6">Intervention</h3><p>The intervention development process was based on the ORBIT model [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Czajkowski SM, Powell LH, Adler N, Naar-King S, Reynolds KD, Hunter CM, et al.

This model guides early stages of intervention development, applying basic behavioral mechanisms of eating and optimizing delivery and dose before moving on to further stages of more formal testing. After completing a pilot study to confirm that the intervention we developed, the MAMAS (Maternal Adiposity, Metabolism, and Stress) Mindful Training, was affecting the purported mechanisms (stress and stress eating), we moved to this efficacy trial. The final intervention, the Mindful Moms Training (MMT), included 8 weekly 2-h sessions, two “booster” telephone sessions, and one postpartum group session with mothers and babies. The intervention was led by two practitioners who worked in pairs. They had graduate degrees (MA, certified nurse midwife, and PhDs), with additional training in both mindfulness and Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training (MB-EAT) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Kristeller JL, Wolever RQ.

The sessions focused on three commitments, represented by the slogan “Mindful Eating, Move My Body, Breathe!” Participants were given a list of physical activities safe for pregnancy, which focused on ways to increase amount of daily walking and stretching.</p><p>Classes began with mindful movement and a check-in where each person shared their experiences with mindfulness practices in the past week. Didactic discussions then covered (1) stress reduction, focused on acceptance-based coping, awareness of breath, body, thoughts, and emotions; (2) mindful eating, focused on heightening awareness of hunger, fullness, taste experience, and thoughts and emotions leading to reactive and/or automatic eating; and (3) nutrition, focused on optimal foods to eat more of (e.g., whole foods), what to eat less of (e.g., processed foods), reading labels, identifying healthy portion sizes, and introducing both the plate method and food pyramid as resources. Each class ended with a minute mindfulness practice and a review of homework for the upcoming week.

                    <p>The primary outcome was gestational weight gain category, based on the 2009 IOM recommendations. Total gestational weight gain was calculated as the difference between weight at the last prenatal visit before delivery, and self-reported pre-pregnancy weight that had been recorded in the medical record. If the last recorded prenatal weight occurred more than 30 days before delivery, total gestational weight gain was coded as missing (<i>n</i> = 23). When pre-pregnancy weight was not recorded in the prenatal record (<i>n</i> = 69), we used self-reported pre-pregnancy weight from the study eligibility screener.</p>

                  <p>This secondary outcome was calculated as the difference between the participant’s measured 6-month postpartum weight and their pre-pregnancy weight. For analysis, this was assessed both as a continuous variable and categorical: the difference in weight at 6 months was dichotomized as higher than their pre-pregnancy weight vs. equal to or less than their pre-pregnancy weight.</p>

                  <h3 id="Sec11"><b>Sociodemographics and Covariate</b>s</h3><p>A parsimonious set of covariates were selected a priori for the two physiological outcomes (weight and glucose control) that are well-established correlates of gestational weight gain. Covariates included age at enrollment (continuous), parity (continuous), gestational age because weight gain is a function of the length of gestation, and pre-pregnancy BMI category (&lt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 30.0–34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and ≥ 35.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). We used pre-pregnancy BMI category as a covariate rather than actual BMI because the IOM weight gain guidelines are based on pre-pregnancy BMI category, and the relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain is non-linear.</p><p>We measured additional sociodemographic variables to further describe the sample. This included race and ethnicity (categorized as Caucasian, African American, Latino, and other/multiracial), educational attainment (&lt;12th grade, high school graduate, any college/vocational training, or college graduate or higher), marital status (single versus married or in a committed relationship), household income (reported value), and smoking status (current, former, or never smoked). Household food security was measured with the 10-item U.S. Adult Food Security Module [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 55" title="Blumberg SJ, Bialostosky K, Hamilton WL, Briefel RR.

Food insecure households were defined as answering “yes” to three or more questions. These additional sociodemographic variables are shown in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab1">1</a>; since they did not vary by group, they were not used as covariates.</p><h3 id="Sec12">Statistical Analyses</h3><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical significance was determined at <i>p</i> &lt; 0<i>.</i>05, two-tailed. The analysis plan followed an intent-to-treat principle by comparing participants’ outcomes in the intervention (regardless of how many classes they attended) to outcomes of all participants in the TAU group. However, an as-treated analysis, comparing women who attended a minimum of five of the eight classes to women in the TAU group, yielded highly similar results. To deal with missing data, for gestational weight gain, analyses were performed on available data, where we removed cases in the presence of missing/incomplete data. For the self-report scales, for missing items, mean substitution was used, unless &gt; 30% of scale items were missing.</p><p>Given that in our theoretical model (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Fig1">1</a>), changes in distress precede and will lead to changes in eating and weight, we first report the psychological variables, then weight change, our primary outcome, and lastly the other physical health outcomes. To examine the intervention effect on outcomes of psychosocial distress, eating behaviors, and mindfulness within each group, we first used paired <i>t</i> tests to compare baseline to post-intervention scores on our measurement scales. For our primary analysis, to test whether the change scores were significantly different when compared to the TAU group, multivariate linear regression models were used to compare the between-group changes, further adjusting for age and pre-pregnancy BMI.</p><p>To examine the intervention effect on gestational weight gain, a multinomial logistic regression model was fit for IOM gestational weight gain category, using “normal” weight gain (e.g., within the IOM guidelines based on a woman’s pre-pregnancy BMI) as the referent group. A sensitivity analysis that excluded women who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) after enrolling in the study was also conducted (<i>n</i> = 23). Covariates included age, pre-pregnancy BMI, and parity.</p><p>For secondary analyses, a multinomial logistic regression model was fit for post-intervention physical activity categories, adjusted for age, pre-pregnancy BMI, and parity. Multivariate logistic regression models were fit for outcomes of impaired glucose tolerance and 6-month postpartum weight retention, adjusted for the study covariates.</p><p>We examined the statistical power for this size of a sample. For a group means comparison, with our actual sample size of roughly 105 per group, we had 80% power to detect a small medium effect size (around <i>d</i> = 0.39).

Of the 879 women we screened, 415 (47.2%) were eligible to participate in the study; 110 were enrolled in the intervention and 105 were enrolled in the TAU group (215 total). The most frequent reasons for ineligibility were BMI outside of the target range (<i>n</i> = 251), early or late gestational age (<i>n</i> = 58), medical or psychosocial reasons (n = 58), and high income (<i>n</i> = 46). During the intervention period, six participants had pregnancy losses (leaving 209 total participants). Ten participants were lost to the study (5% of enrolled sample): one participant moved out of state, one was unable to attend classes due to logistical reasons, and eight were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. Our final sample included 95 intervention and 90 TAU participants who had weight outcomes (185/ 209), 89% of the remaining eligible sample. Due to missing data, there were fewer who completed the questionnaires at both timepoints: 82 intervention and 89 TAU participants (171/209, 82%).

Results were also tested with “as-treated” group, and results did not change. Therefore, all results presented are with the intent-to-treat full sample. Baseline characteristics of the sample are shown in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab1">1</a>. The mean age of the sample was 27.9 years. Approximately 39% had a high school education or less, the average annual household income was less than $25,000, and 42% of women reported food insecurity. Most women (67%) were married or in a committed relationship. Women were screened and enrolled into the study using self-report of weight and height. According to their pre-pregnancy BMI based on the prenatal medical record, 4% of women were categorized as normal weight, 54% of women were overweight, and 47% were obese (26% with class 1 obesity and 21% with class 2 obesity). Eligibility was based on their initial self-reported pre-pregnancy BMI at screener (between 25 and 41 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and thus we still included the women with BMI &lt; 25. Their actual measured BMI for <i>n</i> = 9 was on average 24. (Note we later conducted a sensitivity analysis on our primary outcome—weight gain category—excluding these nine participants, and found that the results were similar.)</p><p>There were no significant differences in sociodemographic or health-related baseline characteristics between women in the intervention group versus the TAU group. For example, they had similar income levels, and had on average one child. We also tested whether the proportion of women who were primagravida/mulitiparous differed by group. There was a similar percentage in each group who were multiparous, with around 50% having already had a child (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.63).</p><h3 id="Sec15">Intervention Effects on Distress and Mindfulness</h3><p>First, we examined within-group effects using paired <i>t</i> tests.

Overall, the intervention group showed significant decreases from baseline to the post-intervention period in distress (perceived stress and depression) and in eating-related behaviors (food addiction, emotional eating, external eating).

Among MMT, 20% of the sample gained less than the IOM recommendations, and among TAUs, this occurred for 11% of the sample, a significant difference (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab3">3</a>). There was a significant association between being in MMT (vs. TAU) with more frequent gestational weight gain below the IOM recommendations (OR 3.83, 95% CI 1.24, 11.83) compared to the referent group of gaining within the IOM recommendations. In other words, there were more women who gained too little, according to the recommendations, in the MMT group.</p><p>To test if weight changes may have occurred due to a medical condition, sensitivity analyses were performed and showed that this effect persisted after excluding women who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (<i>n</i> = 23). It is also possible that the excessive weight gain was in part already determined by the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and therefore could not be influenced by the intervention. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to eliminate the 17% (<i>n</i> = 25) of women who had already gained in excess of the IOM recommendations at the start of the intervention period, around 20 weeks, regardless of group assignment. This exclusion did not change results.</p><p>Lastly, we conducted post hoc Pearson correlations between changes in reported distress and our primary outcome, changes in weight. There were no significant relationships for either stress (<i>r</i> = − 0.05) or for depressive symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.06) with weight change.</p><p><i>Postpartum weight retention</i>. At 6 months post partum, both groups showed weight retention (6 kg for TAU, 4 kg for MMT), but there was wide variance and no statistically significant differences between groups (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab4">4</a>). When examined categorically, 30% of women in the intervention were either at or below their pre-pregnancy weight, compared to 22% of women in the TAU group. After adjustment for covariates, MMT showed lower 6-month postpartum weight retention, but this was not significant (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.25, 1.23).</p><p><i>Physical activity</i> among women in the intervention and TAU conditions are shown in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab4">4</a>. Women in the intervention group reported higher levels of leisure-time physical activity than women in the TAU group covarying baseline levels (<i>β</i> = 0.58). After adjustment for covariates and baseline physical activity, the intervention was associated with greater odds of having high levels of activity, around 3 times/week (OR 2.55, 95% 1.13, 5.72) and around 5 times/week (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.60, 8.97; Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab4">4</a>).</p>

                  <p>Women in the MMT group started classes at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy and received at least half of the intervention classes before the OGTT was performed, at 24–28 weeks’ gestation. Glucose levels were examined both as a continuous measure and as a categorical measure (of impaired glucose tolerance), 1 h after the glucose drink (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab4">4</a>). The MMT group had mean levels of 100 mg/dL, whereas the TAU group had significantly higher mean levels of 111 mg/dL (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.03). When examined categorically, approximately 8% of women in the intervention and 21% of women in the TAU group had a glucose level above 130 mg/dL. After adjustment for age, pre-pregnancy BMI, and parity, the intervention was associated with significantly lower odds of exhibiting impaired glucose tolerance (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12, 0.97).</p>

Our sample was a young, low-income, ethnically diverse sample of pregnant women who had high baseline levels of stress, food insecurity, and a sedentary lifestyle. We found that although women in MMT did not gain less weight than women in the comparison group (our primary outcome), they did demonstrate significant improvements on secondary outcomes: psychological stress and depression, two important mental health outcomes, as well as glucose control on the OGTT and reported physical activity. They had on average around 2 point reductions in stress and depression, post-intervention. As reported elsewhere, they were less likely to have significant depressive symptoms up to 9 months later [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Felder JN, Laraia B, Coleman-Phox K, Bush N, Suresh M, Thomas M, et al.

If improvements in stress were maintained over time, it should theoretically temper the excessive weight gain. In this study, in post hoc exploratory analyses, we did assess relations between self-reported stress with weight change, but found no significant relationships. This lack of relationship may indicate that the model does not apply well to this sample, or, quite possibly, it could be due to the limited measurement design (measured only pre/post and using trait measures) and/or because the majority gained excessive weight, leaving little variance to explain in weight outcomes.</p><p>Other improvements seen, such as lower distress and glucose tolerance, may be equally important to maternal and offspring health as the level of weight gain. The better glucose control during pregnancy is important both for maternal and infant health. The finding that mindful eating training was associated with an improvement in glucose homeostasis, in the absence of differences in weight gain, in comparison to a TAU group, has been found in two other studies of non-pregnant adults—one study of mindful eating in men and women with obesity [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 39" title="Olson KL, Emery CF.

Given this preliminary pattern of findings on glucose but not weight across three studies now, it is possible that mindful eating has larger effects on glucose than on weight loss or maintenance but this requires further investigation.</p><p>The intervention taught mindful eating skills, thus it was not surprising that the MMT group reported significant improvements in measures of eating in response to external cues or emotions, and the change in external eating was marginally significantly greater compared to the TAU group. It is not known if this was due to demand characteristics or actual changes in eating behavior. Both groups improved on a measure of food addiction, an unexpected finding. While it is possible that reductions in strong drive to eat might occur naturally during pregnancy, this needs further study.</p><p>Despite the benefits in emotional well-being and glucose control, we failed to find a significant difference between intervention and control participants on our primary outcome of weight gain. Almost 70% of women in the sample, regardless of group, gained excessive weight. One reason may be that the sample studied here tends to be among the highest risk for excessive gestational weight gain, with the co-occurrence of several major risk factors—pre-pregnancy overweight or obese status, low income, food insecurity, and minority status [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Laraia BA, Siega-Riz AM, Gundersen C.

The environmental conditions our sample faced related to poverty, such as insufficient resources for reliable and healthy food, and living in unsafe neighborhoods, can work together to constrain and limit individual behavior and ability to control dietary intake.</p><p>Another potential reason for the lack of impact on weight gain may be the late timing and short duration of the intervention. The intervention started as late as week 20 of pregnancy. A substantial number of women enrolled in our study had already gained close to or exceeded the IOM weight gain recommendation before the intervention had started (almost 20%). A sensitivity analysis showed that even excluding women who had excessive weight gain at 20 weeks did not change results. Preventing or reducing excess maternal weight before conception is likely the most effective weight management strategy [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Catalano PM.

While it is always advantageous to have a randomized control group, in alignment with the ORBIT model, the focus at this stage of the research was to tailor an intervention to meet the needs of the specific population, and to examine mechanisms and efficacy of early outcomes, rather than to conduct a large randomized controlled trial. Our study fulfilled many of the goals of the ORBIT model. We developed an intervention that was highly accepted with good fidelity and attendance [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Vieten C, Laraia B, Kristeller J, Adler N, Coleman-Phox K, Bush N, et al. The Mindful Moms Training: development of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce stress and overeating during pregnancy. BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2018;" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#ref-CR43" id="ref-link-section-d94970973e3491">43</a>], and found the intervention group improved on stress, depression, and had better glucose tolerance compared to the treatment as usual group, but found no improvement on weight gain, and the presumed links between stress and weight change were not detected.</p><p>A limitation in our design was the lack of ability to sensitively test our mediational model. Proximal mechanisms and behavioral risk factors are best measured with frequent samples of behavior. To test how changes in daily affect, stress, and emotion regulation might be impacting eating behavior, and eventually clinical outcomes like weight, more sensitive measurements than pre–post trait measures are necessary. We recommend that future studies utilize ecological momentary assessments or end-of-day diaries to assess mechanisms and changes in behavior in a more granular way.</p><p>Although our assignment strategy based on gestational weeks (as well as inability to attend classes based on schedule) resulted in matched groups on sociodemographic measures, the women in the comparison group were enrolled a few weeks later in their pregnancy, which may have influenced results in unknown ways. The later stage of pregnancy could have biased the TAU group to have even fewer women who were glucose intolerant because we ruled out women with gestational diabetes at enrollment, and they were more likely to know at their later stage of pregnancy. Despite this potential bias, we found more women, not fewer, with glucose intolerance in the TAU group. The women had to be able to attend our class at a certain weekly day and time (typically evening). Women who knew they would not be able to attend most of the classes were included in the control group. The primary reasons for not being able to attend were family and work commitments in the evening or geographic distance. We tried to minimize obstacles by providing $25 per session to offset childcare and/or transportation. The women in the intervention group may have had more control over their schedules, leading to selection bias. However, as noted in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-019-09779-2#Tab1">1</a>, there were no sociodemographic or psychological differences between the two groups at baseline.</p><p>Another limitation of the study was the lack of objectively measured repeated outcomes such as physical activity, and insulin sensitivity, and daily measures that are more sensitive than trait measurement. This was a challenging sample to recruit and maintain, given their low income, limited availability, lack of transportation, unexpected life events, network stressors, and high stress, and for some, housing instability. However, we would in future studies prioritize getting repeated weight measures of all enrolled women and, when possible, objective measurements of health behaviors. It is also notable that almost 40% of eligible women did not respond to our invitation (<i>n</i> = 146) or declined (<i>n</i> = 17) typically because of difficulty and obstacles in their family and work schedules. If the intervention was part of bundled care, such as in Centering Pregnancy, it would have been easier to reach more women.</p><p>It is important to examine race/ethnicity separately from socioeconomic factors, which requires a larger sample size and stratification by SES. Even within our all low-income sample, the non-Hispanic whites tended to have higher education and income than the non-whites and Hispanics. By including only low-income women, we reduced structural confounding, but could not wholly eliminate it. Further, our sample size was not sufficient to examine separate effects of race/ethnicity subgroups and SES.</p><p>In conclusion, we found preliminary evidence of several important benefits of a short-term mindfulness intervention for low-income, ethnic-minority pregnant women with overweight or obesity. Given the demonstrated benefits to maternal mental and metabolic health, we believe that this intervention has substantial promise to impact maternal and infant outcomes. The ORBIT model provides the framework for next steps—such as further optimization of intervention, dose and duration, refinement of and more sophisticated measurement protocols of mechanisms, and then testing in a larger randomized clinical trial for efficacy. Efforts to continue to develop this intervention and those like it are desperately needed, especially since pregnancy is a highly influential period for the long-term trajectories of both maternal and offspring health.</p></div></div>

It&#39;s not about apps or a screen time, it&#39;s about social connection (even ephemeral) that gives this gratification and makes our brains summoning the apps.</i><p>This. I&#39;ve concluded the same, observing my own interaction patterns. I use very little social media (would&#39;ve ditched Facebook if not for Messenger, and Instagram if not for my wife liking to post &#34;stories&#34;). I do, however, have a huge HN problem. But it&#39;s not a <i>consumption</i> problem. I feel a compulsion to comment (like here, now). If I don&#39;t do it - e.g. because I can&#39;t find anything I feel like responding to - I quickly get tired and it&#39;s easy to close all those HN tabs.</p><p>I&#39;ve tried breaks from HN. Each time, I somehow ended up on Reddit. Again, not consuming, but engaging in discussions on various subreddits that tend to be more about conversation than links. The few times I tried to stop myself from that, I quickly ended up on Mastodon, posting &#34;tweet storms&#34; and creating more interesting conversations.</p><p>So at least in my case, it&#39;s <i>definitely</i> about connection. Pure consumption has its draw, but I can kick that somewhat easily. But those kinds of conversation - which, for reasons I&#39;m not sure of, have no equivalent in meat space - have me in an iron grip.

It actually lasted a year. In the process, I&#39;ve learned a few things about myself:</p><p>- Somewhat quickly, I found myself commenting a lot on Reddit; when I tried to limit that, I ended up posting a lot on Mastodon; there were also brief moments spent on some niche discussion boards;</p><p>- My procrastination problem did <i>not</i> get better;</p><p>- Both Mastodon and some of the subreddits were... OK. They satiated (what I finally realized was) my need for interesting conversations on-line. At the same time, something always felt off. I eventually realized that those communities were a bit short on civility, intellectual curiosity, and related qualities. Switching to them from HN felt like switching from home-cooked meals to living on McDonald&#39;s and party food diet.</p><p>Which is why, after a year, I mailed &#39;dang to reset my noprocrast, and came back here - if this type of conversations are to be my drug either way, I could at least stick to a high-quality supply.

I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s gotten worse here, though it doesn&#39;t seem to be improving.  (There are exceptions, of course.)  There&#39;s also far too often a lack of follow-through --- an exchange such as we&#39;re having here is quite rare.</p><p>I&#39;ve also been doing some analytics of the HN front page over the past few days (some of that&#39;s in some recent HN comments, most is in my Mastodon stream, #HackerNewsAnalytics).  I&#39;d scraped every front page from 20 Feb 2007 to present (updated to 28 May 2023, and I can grab additional pages and update data fairly quickly).</p><p>Looking at the HN Leaders page, it&#39;s interesting to see how wildly different individual members&#39; activity is.  Quite a few of the leaders have very few front-page submissions (at least one has none at all), others have many hundreds.  I notice you&#39;ve had few FP submissions (though you do submit a fair number of items).  I don&#39;t know quite how commenting on others&#39; stories vs. submitting your own changes site dynamics and usage, but it&#39;s another element to consider.[1]</p><p>Mastodon <i>occasionally</i> clicks for me, though it&#39;s mostly with people I&#39;ve known for a long time, and often across multiple platforms, typically HN &amp; Google+ (you&#39;d be in that group).</p><p>Mostly, though, I&#39;m less enchanted by the state of online discussion of late.</p><p>________________________________</p><p>Notes:</p><p>1. For the curious:  highest number of front-page (FP) stories from a Leaders profile is 1,183 (795 distinct sites).  For 7 profiles there are no FP stories.  Mean is 164.09, median is 104.5, standard deviation, 199.988.  10%ile:  3, 25%ile: 11, 75%ile: 217, 90%ile: 493.5.  Distinct sites range from 0 (obviously) to 795, mean 102.77, median 53.  It&#39;s quite a range.</p><p>It&#39;s quite a range.

And overseeing all those, a mindfulness practice where you can identify when your emotions arise, both that pull you to your habit (nip those in the bud) and those that drive you away from it (&#34;I should get up&#34;, do it right away).

- for how long?
- why? (is it simply due to our &#39;wandering&#39; brains? And/or it is more causally connected to environmental factors, such as attention-stealing devices?)

They&#39;re usually sent by the courts (in the US, at least) due to some misdemeanor they commited while drunk, as though those of us battling ourselves are supposed to teach some 20-something how to be responsible adult because their parents failed them. Sometimes one of those court-sent people finds out they have a real problem, and end up sticking around. However, for the most part, the rest are there for a few weeks because they have to be, we sign their slips, and never see them again. We don&#39;t give out chips for that.

Zero.&#34;</p><p>That is almost impossible these days. We increasingly require smart phones such that NOT having/using one is difficult, even for those who don&#39;t want one. Important information and services are moving to the internet, making a non-internet life more difficult. Yet the author wants use to consider that as a viable solution!</p><p>AA promotes abstinence, and supports people who want to maintain abstinence. As I often go for months without drinking alcohol, I know that there is still a lot one can do without drinking.</p><p>What would you do if your company required you to drink alcohol to work, your kid&#39;s school required you to drink alcohol to check on your kid&#39;s status, a restaurant required you to do a shot to get a menu, and you couldn&#39;t rent a bike without first drinking even more alcohol?</p><p>And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like the author&#39;s use of an essentially impossible solution as the comparison.</p><p>While Weight Watcher&#39;s and other diet plans don&#39;t say &#34;abstain from all food&#34;, which of course is impossible.</p><p>WW specifically uses a points-based system so that some foods, like &#34;leafy greens, carrots, tomatoes, green beans, asparagus, onions, broccoli and radishes&#34; have zero points, and can be consumed without limit. (Compare that to a calorie-based diet.)</p><p>By the WW analogy, some screen time, like logging into your bank to check on the accounts, would have zero points while others, like writing comments on HN :), would have points, setting a limit to one&#39;s daily use.</p><p>Which seems to map well to what the author is proposing (&#34;parameters to evaluate quality, not quantity, of the time spent staring at your screens&#34;).</p><p>I also don&#39;t like &#34;Go on, spend 4 hours on an app. Just make sure you decided to—and that you feel those 4 hours are life well spent.&#34; because if the author really believes the alcoholism analogy is true, then it&#39;s saying the author either doesn&#39;t believe any of the readers actually have a screen time problem, or believes it&#39;s okay for an alcoholic to spend 4 hours drinking at the bar with friends, so long if it feels like a life well spent. And something similar for the crack cocaine user.</p><p>P.S. In researching the Weight Watcher&#39;s/food analogy I found out that the existence of &#34;food addition&#34; is under debate, where the &#39;language of addiction&#39; is used to explain one&#39;s feelings and provide a means of communicating distress and helplessness, rather than being an addition in the same way that drugs are addictive.  See  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0203-9" rel="nofollow">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0203-9</a> . With my daily allotment of Internet Watchers points nearly gone, I&#39;ll not research the scholarly views of &#34;internet addition&#34;.

I myself am completely unable to limit my consumption of novel information input by “willpower” or whatever. I’m 18 yo, and the internet, programming, HN, reddit and all are too damn interesting, unnaturally, too much. My brain is completely wired to seek novel information input and surge dopamine. I was an addict of some other thing before too, and I know this is %100 dopamine addiction. The only solution that I found to work, that lets my brain “breathe” and brain fog to clear is restricting access.<p>I set the password of my iPhone to a 20-digit number which I surely won’t be able to memorize while setting it up. I put all my contacts to my Emergency Contacts so that I can call them without unlocking my phone. I’m logged in to WhatsApp Web on my iPad, I use it from there. My iPad has Screen Time on, its settings are controlled from my iPhone. All domains except some necessary government etc. domains are blocked, and new app installing is disabled on the iPad. After setting up Screen Time, I asked my brother to enter a random password for the Screen Time password and forget it.</p><p>I created an iOS Shortcut on my iPhone which dictates my password[2] only if I’m X meters away from banned locations (home &amp; school), because every once in a while I need to unlock my phone to do something. I go on a walk/run and unlock my phone in that case. The shortcut is a widget, it works while my phone is locked.</p><p>I also time-locked[1] this password to 24 hours (you can only open it after a decryption process which takes 24 hours) and saved it to my DO server in its locked form, because Shortcuts very rarely doesn’t work. I use my server to decrypt if needed.</p><p>My computer’s (NixOS) password is time-locked too, as I’m currently still in school and shouldn’t be using it (Little time left to university exam). After the exam, I plan to lock it down to 6 hours a day and writing a browser extension which uses an LLM to close the current tab if I’m not working on my project X and instead say, doomscrolling HN.</p><p>1: I use this program I wrote, in case anyone is interested: <a href="https://github.com/aerbil313/timelock">https://github.com/aerbil313/timelock</a></p><p>2: It doesn’t dictate the password digits for security reasons. It plays a different notification tone for each digit while I’m entering the password. I memorized which sound is which.

		<p>There’s lots to be said (and felt) about Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs); they’re often a step that a company takes when an employee is not meeting the expectations of their role, and their manager (or the company) is considering whether or not to terminate this person’s employment.</p>

<p>I’m oversimplifying here, but you can think of a PIP as explicit documentation about what a person needs to do differently within a specific timeframe, both to make sure there’s clarity and a shared understanding between them and the manager/company. If the employee is ultimately fired, a PIP also creates a paper trail, should the employee bring a lawsuit about their termination.</p>

<p>Often there’s a template that HR will suggest a manager use to draft the PIP, ensuring it outlines behaviors that the employee needs to demonstrate to their manager, (again, within a certain timeline).</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been on a PIP, you might have seen it as a signal that you’re about to be fired.</p>

<p>It’s not always the case that a PIP results in termination; I’ve definitely seen the PIP process help someone <em>finally</em> receive a clear articulation of what they need to do differently, which led to them adjusting their approach and getting the support they need to be successful! But because of how it’s traditionally used, PIPs are one of the most common HR processes I’ve seen that leave folks feeling unfairly treated by their managers and the company.</p>

<p>So what do you do, as a manager, when your own manager or HR rep suggests that you create a PIP for your underperforming direct report?</p>

<h2 id="why-might-you-create-a-pip">Why might you create a PIP?</h2>

<p>I have… a lot of complicated feelings about PIPs.</p>

<p>Documenting feedback around missed expectations is, of course, important, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s obvious value in writing down what’s expected of a person in a particular role; that’s why we have job descriptions and career ladders! And depending upon how these frameworks work at your organization, it can be helpful to further contextualize the responsibilities of a general role/level to your report’s specific situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person might not recognize that they need to behave differently, or that they’re not meeting expectations. So it’s crucial for managers to clearly, directly, and fairly give them a heads-up about the behavior gap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, performance feedback has already been given to someone, but it was in a piecemeal way over a stretch of time. So succinctly collecting all of the crucial feedback in one place might be the first time that they’re seeing everything put together. It might be a shock to them, but it’s really important to see the narrative that has developed about their performance, perhaps unbeknownst to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s unfair to use <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/tough-love-for-managers-giving-feedback/#3-i-get-that-youre-worried-about-how-someones-going-to-react-to-your-negative-feedback-especially-while-the-world-is-upside-down-but-youre-not-allowed-to-soften-the-feedback-so-much-that-your-report-doesnt-understand-what-they-should-do-next">fuzzy language</a> when your direct report is missing the mark. It’s also unfair to *only* use your mouthwords when giving essential feedback, and then expect that person to recall what was said going forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing down role expectations—and feedback about missed expectations—in a shared place that can be referred back to later is one of the most <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/performance-reviews-should-be-unsurprising-fair-and-motivating/">fair</a> things we can do as managers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So why do I have complicated feelings about PIPs? Here’s what usually makes me concerned when I hear a manager (or their HR rep) is considering creating a PIP. It’s complicated, and here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While a PIP restates role expectations and gives the employee a heads up that they need to behave differently, the typical PIP doesn’t give them new tools, training, or support, nor does it change their role, etc. So if a manager (or a company) doesn’t believe a person will be able to meet role expectations, then creating a PIP won’t help them—it’ll unkindly string them along through a weeks-long process with a destination only known to those delivering the PIP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A PIP helps the company (it’ll be documentation, if needed, for future inquiries from the legal department) but it doesn’t really change the situation for the employee. That said, a PIP <em>will</em> give the employee a heads up that termination of their employment is on the table, and signal that they might want to start looking for a new role, if they don’t feel like they can meet expectations in their current one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be problematic knock-on effects from PIPs that deserve their own post. For example, receiving a PIP changes other leaders’ perceptions of that employee, and this can have lasting effects on their ability to make progress in their career.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a case when a PIP <em>does</em> help an employee? Sure: if a person hasn’t received a clear signal (or hasn’t recognized) that they’re missing baseline role expectations, then writing a PIP can be that neon-red, flashing sign that they need to change their behavior.</p>

<p>So today, I want to offer you a step-by-step approach if you’re faced with the “to PIP, or not to PIP?” question as a manager. My goal is to help you navigate this process in a way that’s as fair as possible to your direct report, while recognizing that HR may require you to create one regardless of whether or not it could actually change the situation.</p>

<h2 id="pip-decision-framework">PIP Decision Framework</h2>

<p>When you’re faced with the question of whether or not to create a PIP, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Ask yourself, “Do I believe this person <strong>will be able to meet these expectations</strong> within 30 days, and consistently thereafter?” If the answer is “no”, consider terminating their employment with a healthy severance package, or finding a new role for them within the organization where they could be more successful.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you’re confident this person could begin meeting these expectations within 30 days—or if you’re just not sure yet—your next step is to brainstorm privately with the prompt, <strong>“What haven&#39;t I stated clearly/bluntly yet to this person about what I expect of someone in this role?”</strong></p>
	<p>It’s your job as a manager to succinctly and directly communicate the expectations of a role, and do the same when you see crucial gaps in someone’s performance of that role. Even if you’ve said these things to them before, there is always *something* that you can newly state or try to explain/describe differently for your direct report.</p></li>
	<li><p>Meet with your report. State (or reiterate) the gap between their work and what’s expected in their role (including anything you identified in step #2) as clearly as possible, to see if the new information/clarity/reframe changes things.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>After you’ve had the conversation in step #3—or at the end of that conversation, if it feels appropriate—ask your report, “<strong>What&#39;s in the way</strong> of meeting these expectations?”</p>
		<p>With this question, your goal is to figure out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Does this person see the <strong>importance</strong> of meeting these expectations?</li>
			<li>Do we see these expectations <strong>differently/disagree</strong> on what they mean or look like?</li>
			<li>Do they not have the <strong>resources</strong> required to meet the expectations? (Are they lacking time? Clarity? Answers from stakeholders?)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on how the “What’s in the way?” conversation goes, you’ll decide to create a PIP or not.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/">feedback equation</a> to underscore why this behavior change is relevant to the things they care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acknowledge that while you might disagree with each other about the importance of this behavior change, it’s a requirement of this role.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they continue to disagree on the importance of an expectation, restate that this behavior/outcome is expected of a person in their role, and you need them to meet that expectation. If they continue to disagree, <em>and</em> you believe that they are capable of meeting this expectation, you might create a PIP as one final attempt to communicate the importance of them meeting this expectation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-you-and-your-report-dont-have-a-shared-understanding-of-these-expectations">If you and your report don’t have a shared understanding of these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
	<li><p>Spend more time clarifying their role requirements with them. You might need to use different examples, identify new signals of what success looks like in the role, ask coaching questions to help them connect their own dots, etc. Don’t be afraid to be extremely direct in this conversation; you can be <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/be-directive-without-being-a-jerk/">blunt and clear without being a jerk</a>. Employ the variety of tools in your manager toolbox to try to gain that shared understanding of what’s expected.</p>
	<p>If you gain a shared understanding of the baseline requirements of the role, but your direct report still disagrees on the importance of a particular responsibility, revisit the section above, “<a href="#if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations</a>”.</p></li>
	<li><p>After you spend more time clarifying the expectations, you might revisit existing shared role documentation (job description, career ladder, etc.) and see where it needs to be updated or edited. Your goal is to create more clarity for *everybody* in that role about what’s expected of them, and what success looks like.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-they-dont-have-the-resources-to-meet-these-expectations">If they don’t have the resources to meet these expectations:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Partner with your report and HR to see if you can create (reasonable) accommodations for them. (For example, if someone is being blocked from getting timely information that’s necessary to do their job, I would partner with my report to figure out a workaround, or I’ll directly step in to get them what they need.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, clearly state that it is their responsibility in this role to develop/find those resources. (For example, it’s <em>their</em> responsibility to respond to questions via chat from their stakeholders within a certain timeframe during common work hours, or find a backup to take over if they need to step away from their computer.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-you-choose-to-create-a-pip">If you choose to create a PIP</h2>

<p>If you decide writing a PIP is the best next step for your employee (or if you’re required to write one by HR, your manager, etc.), make sure that the contents of the PIP are <strong>measurable</strong> and <strong>time-bound</strong>. A PIP is about communicating the importance of meeting a particular expectation, and making sure it’s possible that you and your direct report can both objectively see whether or not they’re meeting those expectations in <em>n</em> days/weeks.</p>

<p>After you write the first draft, re-read it to see if these are <strong>things you expect of anybody in this role</strong>, or if these are unique expectations you have for this specific person. I’ve seen drafts of PIPs where the manager has softened the expectations (like if the role requires writing a report every week, the manager wrote “deliver a report at least every other week” in the PIP). I’ve also seen managers refer to expectations <em>beyond</em> what’s normally required in the role (like a requirement to “present your findings to the VP” when the standard expectation of the role is to simply create a dashboard). The document should describe measurable, time-bound expectations that match what’s expected of <em>anybody</em> in this role.</p>

<p>PIPs are a complex tool that each organization approaches and utilizes differently. As someone’s manager, <strong>you do have agency</strong> to push back on what HR is asking you to do, ask for more time to give your report clear and specific feedback, suggest tweaks to the process, advocate for an alternative (like immediate termination with a severance package that supports the employee with pay and health insurance for a few months), etc. Your efforts may or may not change the path forward, but I believe it’s worth it to optimize for fairness to your employee during this really tough process while recognizing your responsibility as a manager.</p>
