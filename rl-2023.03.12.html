<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> &#34;If I formally verify my code, I don&#39;t need to test it!&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Researchers looked at three formally verified systems, and found critical correctness bugs in all three. The bugs were from &#34;a wide range of mismatched assumptions&#34; and caused servers to crash or produce wrong data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Most bugs were at the system boundaries; none were found in the implemented protocols. Formally verified systems, while not perfect, were considerably less buggy than unverified systems.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype</strong>: Your favourite programming language has been updated. The new
version makes impressive performance improvement claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower</strong>: Benchmarking modern programming languages under near-ideal
circumstances, just for longer than before, suggests that we have not been
benchmarking language implementations as accurately as we might wish. Many
benchmarks slow down over time. Some never stabilise. Many benchmarking
experiments will not be repeatable due to non-determinism. Warmup time is
important, but is usually either ignored, or reported inaccurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats</strong>: Only evaluates the x86_64 architecture, and for only two
operating systems (Linux and OpenBSD). Experiment conducted in 2017 (prior to
meltdown patching). Evaluates mainly JITted language implementations
(although C benchmarks were included).</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> Expensify found that running a single bare-metal server was both faster and cheaper than using a x1e.32xlarge EC2 instance. By using one server, they could avoid sharding their data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> Does not cover if scaling out bare metal has the same advantages over scaling out EC2 (assuming you can afford sharding). Can&#39;t really compare how much cheaper the bare metal is because they don&#39;t list the cost. I&#39;m guessing their servers are 100k each? No basis for that guess though.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Hype:</strong> Compared to other languages, Go&#39;s concurrency system of goroutines and channels is easier to understand, easier to use, and is less prone to bugs and memory leaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Shower:</strong> According to an empirical study by Tu, <em>et al</em>, there are plenty of concurrency-related bugs related to the difficulty in understanding and following the concurrency features and patterns provided by Go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong> This study is specific to Go. Though other languages provide similar facilities, they are not covered in this article. Also, the types of bugs seen with channels and shared memory are different. Channels lead to more blocking bugs (deadlocks, dangling channels) while shared-memory lead to more nonblocking bugs (race conditions, dirty reads).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes:</strong> &#34;We studied six popular Go software including Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC. We analyzed 171 concurrency bugs in total, with more than half of them caused by non-traditional, Go-specific problems&#34;</p>

<p>In practice, computer code is constantly being transformed. At the beginning of a project, the computer code often takes the form of sketches that are gradually refined. Later, the code can be optimized or corrected, sometimes for many years.</p>
<p>Soon enough, programmers realized that they needed to¬†not only to store files, but also to keep track of the different versions of a given file. It is no accident that we are all familiar with the fact that software is often associated with versions. It is necessary to distinguish the different versions of the computer code in order to keep track of updates.</p>
<p>We might think that after developing a new version of a software, the previous versions could be discarded. However, it is practical to keep a copy of each version of the computer code for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>A change in the code that we thought was appropriate may cause problems: we need to be able to go back quickly.</li>
<li>Sometimes different versions of the computer code are used at the same time and it is not possible for all users to switch to the latest version. If an error is found in a previous version of the computer code, it may be necessary for the programmer to go back and correct the error in an earlier version of the computer code without changing the current code. In this scenario, the evolution of the software is not strictly linear. It is therefore possible to release version 1.0, followed by version 2.0, and then release version 1.1.</li>
<li>It is sometimes useful to be able to go back in time to study the evolution of the code in order to understand the motivation behind a section of code. For example, a section of code may have been added without much comment to quickly fix a new bug. The attentive programmer will be able to better understand the code by going back and reading the changes in context.</li>
<li>Computer code is often modified by different programmers working at the same time. In such a social context, it is often useful to be able to quickly determine who made what change and when. For example, if a problem is caused by a segment of code, we may want to question the programmer who last worked on that segment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Programmers quickly realized that they needed version control systems. The basic functions that a version control system provides are rollback and a history of changes made. Over time, the concept version control has spread. There are even several variants intended for the general public such as DropBox where various files, not only computer code, are stored.</p>
<p>The history of software version control tools dates back to the 1970s (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1975.6312866">Rochkind, 1975</a>). In 1972, Rochkind developed the SCCS (Source Code Control System) at Bell Laboratories. This system made it possible to create, update and track changes in a software project. SCCS remained a reference from the end of the 1970s until the 1980s. One of the constraints of SCCS is that it does not allow collaborative work: only one person can modify a given file at a given time.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Tichy proposed the RCS (Revision Control System), which innovated with respect to SCCS by storing only the differences between the different versions of a file in backward order, starting from the latest file. In contrast, SCCS stored differences in forward order starting from the first version. For typical use where we access the latest version, RCS is faster.</p>
<p>In programming, we typically store computer code within text files. Text files most often use ASCII or Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-16) encoding. Lines are separated by a sequence of special characters that identify the end of a line and the beginning of a new line. Two characters are often used for this purpose: ‚Äúcarriage return‚Äù (CR) and ‚Äúline feed‚Äù (LF). In ASCII and UTF-8, these characters are represented with the byte having the value 13 and the byte having the value 10 respectively. In Windows, the sequence is composed of the CR character followed by the LF character, whereas in Linux and macOS, only the LF character is used. In most programming languages, we can represent these two characters with the escape sequences \r and \n respectively. So the string ‚Äúa\nb\nc‚Äù has three lines in most programming languages under Linux or macOS: the lines ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúb‚Äù and ‚Äúc‚Äù.</p>
<p>When a text file is edited by a programmer, usually only a small fraction of all lines are changed. Some lines may also be inserted or deleted. It is convenient to describe the differences as succinctly as possible by identifying the new lines, the deleted lines and the modified lines.</p>
<p>The calculation of differences between two text files is often done first by breaking the text files into lines. We then treat a text file as a list of lines. Given two versions of the same file, we want to associate as many lines in the first version as possible with an identical line in the second version. We also assume that the order of the lines is not reversed.</p>
<p>We can formalize this problem by looking for the longest common subsequence. Given a list, a subsequence simply takes a part of the list, excluding some elements. For example, (a,b,d) is a subsequence of the list (a,b,c,d,e). Given two lists, we can find a common subsequence, e.g. (a,b,d) is a subsequence of the list (a,b,c,d,e) and the list (z,a,b,d). The longest common subsequence between two lists of text lines represents the list of lines that have not been changed between the two versions of a text file. It might be difficult to solve this program using brute force. Fortunately, we can compute the longest common subsequence by dynamic programming. Indeed, we can make the following observations.</p>
<ol>
<li>If we have two strings with a longest subsequence of length k, and we add at the end of each of the two strings the same character, the new strings will have a longer subsequence of length k+1.</li>
<li>If we have two strings of lengths m and n, ending in distinct characters (for example, ‚Äúabc‚Äù and ‚Äúabd‚Äù), then the longest subsequence of the two strings is the longest subsequence of the two strings after removing the last character from one of the two strings. In other words, to determine the length of the longest subsequence between two strings, we can take the maximum of the length of the subsequence after amputating one character from the first string while keeping the second unchanged, and the length of the subsequence after amputating one character from the second string while keeping the first unchanged.<br/>
These two observations are sufficient to allow an efficient calculation of the length of the longest common subsequence. It is sufficient to start with strings comprising only the first character and to add progressively the following characters. In this way, one can calculate all the longest common subsequences between the truncated strings. It is then possible to reverse this process to build the longest subsequence starting from the end. If two strings end with the same character, we know that the last character will be part of the longest subsequence. Otherwise, one of the two strings is cut off from its last character, making our choice in such a way as to maximize the length of the longest common subsequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following function illustrates a possible solution to this problem. Given two arrays of strings, the function returns the longest common subsequence. If the first string has length <code>m</code> and the second <code>n</code>, then the algorithm runs in <code>O(m*n)</code> time.</p>

<p>Once the subsequence has been calculated, we can quickly calculate a description of the difference between the two text files. Simply move forward in each of the text files, line by line, stopping as soon as you reach a position corresponding to an element of the longest sub-sequence. The lines that do not correspond to the subsequence in the first file are considered as having been deleted, while the lines that do not correspond to the subsequence in the second file are considered as having been added. The following function illustrates a possible solution.</p>

The function we propose as an illustration for computing the longest subsequence uses <code>O(m*n)</code> memory elements. It is possible to reduce the memory usage of this function and simplify it (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/360825.360861">Hirschberg, 1975</a>). Several other improvements are possible in practice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.4380151102">Miller and Myers, 1985</a>). We can then represent the changes between the two files in a concise way.</p>
<p>Suggested reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">article Diff (wikipedia)</a></p>
<p>Like SCCS, RCS does not allow multiple programmers to work on the same file at the same time. The need to own a file to the exclusion of all other programmers while working on it may have seemed a reasonable constraint at the time, but it can make the work of a team of programmers much more cumbersome.</p>
<p>In 1986 Grune developed the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Unlike previous systems, CVS allows multiple programmers to work on the same file simultaneously. It also adopts a client-server model that allows a single directory to be present on a network, accessible by multiple programmers simultaneously. The programmer can work on a file locally, but as long as he has not transmitted his version to the server, it remains invisible to the other developers.</p>
<p>The remote server also serves as a de facto backup for the programmers. Even if all the programmers‚Äô computers are destroyed, it is possible to start over with the code on the remote server.</p>
<p>In a version control system, there is usually always a single latest version. All programmers make changes to this latest version. However, such a linear approach has its limits. An important innovation that CVS has updated is the concept of a branch. A branch allows to organize sets of versions that can evolve in parallel. In this model, the same file is virtually duplicated. There are then two versions of the file (or more than two) capable of evolving in parallel. By convention, there is usually one main branch that is used by default, accompanied by several secondary branches. Programmers can create new branches whenever they want. Branches can then be merged: if a branch A is divided into two branches (A and B) which are modified, it is then possible to bring all the modifications into a single branch (merging A and B). The branch concept is useful in several contexts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some software development is speculative. For example, a programmer may explore a new approach without being sure that it is viable. In such a case, it may be better to work in a separate branch and merge with the main branch only if successful.</li>
<li>The main branch may be restricted to certain programmers for security reasons. In such a case, programmers with reduced access may be restricted to separate branches. A programmer with privileged access may then merge the secondary branch after a code inspection.</li>
<li>A branch can be used to explore a particular bug and its fix.</li>
<li>A branch can be used to update a previous version of the code. Such a version may be kept up to date because some users depend on that earlier version and want to receive certain fixes. In such a case, the secondary branch may never be integrated with the main branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the drawbacks of CVS is poor performance when projects include multiple files and multiple versions. In 2000, Subversion (SVN) was proposed as an alternative to CVS that meets the same needs, but with better performance.</p>
<p>CVS and Subversion benefit from a client-server approach, which allows multiple programmers to work simultaneously with the same version directory. Yet programmers often want to be able to use several separate remote directories.</p>
<p>To meet these needs, various ‚Äúdistributed version control systems‚Äù (DVCS) have been developed. The most popular one is probably the Git system developed by Torvalds (2005). Torvalds was trying to solve a problem of managing Linux source code. Git became the dominant version management tool.<br/>
tool. It has been adopted by Google, Microsoft, etc. It is free software.</p>
<p>In a distributed model, a programmer who has a local copy of the code can synchronize it with either one directory or another. They can easily create a new copy of the remote directory on a new server. Such flexibility is considered essential in many complex projects such as the Linux operating system kernel.</p>
<p>Several companies offer Git-based services including GitHub. Founded in 2008, GitHub has tens of millions of users. In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion.</p>
<p>For CVS and Subversion, there is only one set of software versions. With a distributed approach, multiple sets can coexist on separate servers. The net result is that a software project can evolve differently, under the responsibility of different teams, with possible future reconciliation.</p>
<p>In this sense, Git is distributed. Although many users rely on GitHub (for example), your local copy can be attached to any remote directory, and it can even be attached to multiple remote directories. The verb ‚Äúclone‚Äù is sometimes used to describe the recovery of a Git project locally, since it is a complete copy of all files, changes, and branches.</p>
<p>If a copy of the project is attached to another remote directory, it is called a fork. We often distinguish between branches and forks. A branch always belongs to the main project. A fork is originally a complete copy of the project, including all branches. It is possible for a fork to rejoin the main project, but it is not essential.</p>
<p>Given a publicly available Git directory, anyone can clone it and start working on it and contributing to it. We can create a new fork. From a fork, we can submit a pull request that invites people to integrate our changes. This allows a form of permissionless innovation. Indeed, it becomes possible to retrieve the code, modify it and propose a new version without ever having to interact directly with the authors.</p>
<p>Systems like CVS and subversion could become inefficient and take several minutes to perform certain operations. Git, in contrast, is generally efficient and fast, even for huge projects. Git is robust and does not get ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù easily. However, it is not recommended to use Git for huge files such as multimedia content: Git‚Äôs strength lies in text files. It should be noted that the implementation of Git has improved over time and includes sophisticated indexing techniques.</p>
<p>Git is often used on the command line. It is possible to use graphical clients. Services like GitHub make Git a little easier.</p>
<p>The basic logical unit of Git is the <code>commit</code>, which is a set of changes to multiple files. A <code>commit</code> includes a reference to at least one parent, except for the first <code>commit</code> which has no parent. A single <code>commit</code> can be the parent of several children: several branches can be created from a <code>commit</code> and each subsequent <code>commit</code> becomes a <code>child</code> of the initial <code>commit</code>. Furthermore, when several branches are merged, the resulting <code>commit</code> will have several parents. In this sense, the <code>commits</code> form an ‚Äúacyclic directed graph‚Äù.</p>
<p>With Git, we want to be able to refer to a <code>commit</code> in an easy way, using a unique identifier. That is, we want to have a short numeric value that corresponds to one <code>commit</code> and one <code>commit</code> only. We could assign each <code>commit</code> a version number (1.0, 2.0, etc.). Unfortunately, such an approach is difficult to reconcile with the fact that <code>commits</code> do not form a linear chain where a <code>commit</code> has one and only one parent. As an alternative, we use a hash function to compute the unique identifier. A hash function takes elements as parameters and calculates a numerical value (hash value). There are several simple hash functions. For example, we can iterate over the bytes contained in a message from a starting value <code>h</code>, by computing <code>h = 31 * h + b</code> where <code>b</code> is the byte value. For example, a message containing bytes 3 and 4 might have a hash value of <code>31 * (31 * 3) + 4</code> if we start <code>h = 0</code>. Such a simple approach is effective in some cases, but it allows malicious users to create collisions: it would be possible to create a fake <code>commit</code> that has the same hash value and thus create security holes. For this reason, Git uses more sophisticated hashing techniques (SHA-1, SHA-256) developed by cryptographic specialists. Commits are identified using a hash value (for example, the hexadecimal numeric value 921103db8259eb9de72f42db8b939895f5651489) which is calculated from the date and time, the comment left by the programmer, the user‚Äôs name, the parents and the nature of the change. In theory, two <code>commits</code> could have the same hash value, but this is an unlikely event given the hash functions used by Git. It‚Äôs not always practical to reference a hexadecimal code. To make things easier, Git allows you to identify a commit with a label (e.g., v1.0.0). The following command will do: <code>git tag -a v1.0.0 -m &#34;version 1.0.0&#34;</code>.</p>
<p>Though tags can be any string, tags often contain sequences of numbers indicating a version. There is no general agreement among programmers on how ¬†to attribute version numbers to a version. However, tags sometimes take the form of three numbers separated by dots: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (for example, 1.2.3). With each new version, 1 is added to at least one of the three numbers. The first number often starts at 1 while the next two start at 0.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first number (MAJOR) must be increased when you make major changes to the code. The other two numbers (MINOR and PATCH) are often reset to zero. For example, you can go from version 1.2.3 to version 2.0.0.</li>
<li>The second number (MINOR) is increased for minor changes (for example, adding a function). When increasing the second number, the first number (MAJOR) is usually kept unchanged and the last number (PATCH) is reset to zero.</li>
<li>The last number (PATCH) is increased when fixing bugs. The other two numbers are not increased.<br/>
There are finer versions of this convention like ‚Äú<a href="https://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>‚Äú.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Git, the programmer can have a local copy of the commit graph. They can add new <code>commits</code>. In a subsequent step, the programmer must ‚Äúpush‚Äù his changes to a remote directory so that the changes become visible to other programmers. The other programmers can fetch the changes using a `pull‚Äô.</p>
<p>Git has advanced collaborative features. For example, the <code>git blame</code> command lets you know who last modified a given piece of code.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Version control in computing is a sophisticated approach that has benefited from many years of work. It is possible to store multiple versions of the same file at low cost and navigate from one version to another quickly.</p>
<p>If you develop code without using a version control tool like Git or the equivalent, you are bypassing proven practices. It‚Äôs likely that if you want to work on complex projects with multiple programmers, your productivity will be much lower without version control.</p>

It‚Äôs bizarre, if you think about it. Certainly most of us don‚Äôt believe ourselves to be shorter or taller than we actually are. We don‚Äôt think of ourselves as having smaller ears or longer noses or curlier hair. Most of us also know where our bodies are in space, what physiologists call ‚Äúproprioception.‚Äù</p><p>Yet we seem to have an awfully rough go of locating ourselves in time. A friend, nearing 60, recently told me that whenever he looks in the mirror, he‚Äôs not so much unhappy with his appearance as startled by it‚Äî‚Äúas if there‚Äôs been some sort of error‚Äù were his exact words. (High-school reunions can have this same confusing effect. You look around at your lined and thickened classmates, wondering how they could have so violently capitulated to age; then you see photographs of yourself from that same event and realize: <i>Oh</i>.) The gulf between how old we are and how old we believe ourselves to be can often be measured in light-years‚Äîor at least a goodly number of old-fashioned Earth ones.</p><p>As one might suspect, there are studies that examine this phenomenon. (There‚Äôs a study for everything.) As one might also suspect, most of them are pretty unimaginative. Many have their origins in the field of gerontology, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-feeling-younger-improve-health-subjective-age-11670009137">designed primarily with an eye toward health outcomes</a>, which means they ask participants how old they feel, which those participants generally take to mean how old do you feel <i>physically</i>, which then leads to the rather unsurprising conclusion that if you feel older, you probably are, in the sense that you‚Äôre aging faster.</p><p>But ‚ÄúHow old do you feel?‚Äù is an altogether different question from ‚ÄúHow old are you in your head?‚Äù The most inspired paper I read about subjective age, from 2006, asked this of its 1,470 participants‚Äîin a Danish population (Denmark being the kind of place where studies like these would happen)‚Äîand what the two authors discovered is that adults over 40 perceive themselves to be, on average, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03193996.pdf">about 20 percent younger than their actual age</a>. ‚ÄúWe ran this thing, and the data were gorgeous,‚Äù says David C. Rubin (75 in real life, 60 in his head), one of the paper‚Äôs authors and a psychology and neuroscience professor at Duke University. ‚ÄúIt was just all these beautiful, smooth curves.‚Äù</p><p>Why we‚Äôre possessed of this urge to subtract is another matter. Rubin and his co-author, Dorthe Berntsen, didn‚Äôt make it the focus of this particular paper, and the researchers who do often propose a crude, predictable answer‚Äînamely, that lots of people consider aging a catastrophe, which, while true, seems to tell only a fraction of the story. You could just as well make a different case: that viewing yourself as younger is a form of optimism, rather than denialism. It says that you envision many generative years ahead of you, that you will not be written off, that your future is not one long, dreary corridor of locked doors.</p><p>I think of my own numbers, for instance‚Äîwhich, though a slight departure from the Rubin-Berntsen rule, are still within a reasonable range (or so Rubin assures me). I‚Äôm 53 in real life but suspended at 36 in my head, and if I stop my brain from doing its usual Tilt-A-Whirl for long enough, I land on the same explanation: At 36, I knew the broad contours of my life, but hadn‚Äôt yet filled them in. I was professionally established, but still brimmed with potential. I was paired off with my husband, but not yet lost in the marshes of a long marriage (and, okay, not yet a tiresome fishwife). I was soon to be pregnant, but not yet a mother fretting about eating habits, screen habits, study habits, the brutal folkways of adolescents, the porn merchants of the internet.</p><p>I was not yet on the gray turnpike of middle age, in other words.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm 35,‚Äù wrote my friend Richard Primus, 53 in real life and a constitutional-law professor at the University of Michigan Law School. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs because that‚Äôs the age I was when my major life questions/statuses reached the resolutions/conditions in which they‚Äôve since remained.‚Äù So: kind of like my answer, but more optimistically rendered. He continued: ‚ÄúMedieval Christian theologians asked the intriguing question ‚ÄòHow old are people in heaven?‚Äô The dominant answer: 33. Partly bc age of Jesus at crucifixion. But I think partly bc it feels like a kind of peak for the combined vigor-maturity index.‚Äù</p><p>The combined vigor-maturity index: Yes!</p><p>Richard was replying to me on Twitter, where I‚Äôd tossed out my query to the crowd: ‚ÄúHow old are you in your head?‚Äù (Turns out I‚Äôm not the only one with this impulse; Sari Botton, the founder of <i>Oldster Magazine</i>, regularly publishes <a href="https://oldster.substack.com/s/oldster-magazine-questionnaires">questionnaires she has issued to novelists, artists, and activists of a certain age, and this is the second question</a>.) Ian Leslie, the author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780062878564"><i>Conflicted</i></a> and two other social-science books (32 in his head, 51 in ‚Äúboring old reality‚Äù), took a similar view to mine and Richard‚Äôs, but added an astute and humbling observation: Internally viewing yourself as substantially younger than you are can make for some serious social weirdness.</p><p>‚Äú30 year olds should be aware that for better or for worse, the 50 year old they‚Äôre talking to thinks they‚Äôre roughly the same age!‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWas at a party over the summer where average was about 28 and I had to make a conscious effort to remember I wasn‚Äôt the same‚Äîthey can tell of course, so it‚Äôs asymmetrical.‚Äù</p><p>Yes. They can tell. I‚Äôve had this unsettling experience, seeing little difference between the 30-something before me and my 50-something self, when suddenly the 30-something will make a comment that betrays just how aware she is of the age gap between us, that this gap seems enormous, that in her eyes I may as well be Dame Judi Dench.</p><p>Although many hewed close to the Rubin-Berntsen rule, the replies I got on Twitter were not always about potential. Many carried with them a whiff of unexpected poignancy. Trauma sometimes played a role: One person was stuck at 32, unable to see themselves as any older than a sibling who‚Äôd died; another was stuck for a long time at age 12, the year her father joined a cult. (Rubin has written about this phenomenon too‚Äîthe centrality of certain events to our memories, especially calamitous ones. Sometimes we freeze at the age of our traumas.)</p><p>My friend Alan, who is in his 50s, told me he thinks of himself as 38 because he still thinks of his 98-year-old father as 80. The writer Molly Jong-Fast replied that she‚Äôs 19 because that‚Äôs the age she got sober. One 36-year-old woman told me she thought the pandemic was a time thief‚Äîshe simply hadn‚Äôt accumulated enough new experiences to justify the addition of more chronological years‚Äîwhich made her younger in her head sometimes, as if she were willing back the clock.</p><p>When I mentioned to a colleague that I was writing this piece, he told me he was 12 in his head, not because he thinks of himself as a child, but because his inner self has remained unchanged as he‚Äôs aged; it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe same consciousness as always since I became conscious.‚Äù His words instantly brought to mind a line from the opening pages of Milan Kundera‚Äôs <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780060932381"><i>Immortality</i></a>: ‚ÄúThere is a certain part of all of us that lives outside of time.‚Äù</p><p>Of course, not everyone I spoke with viewed themselves as younger. There were a few old souls, something I would have once said about myself. I felt 40 at 10, when the gossip and cliquishness of other little girls seemed not just cruel but dull; I felt 40 at 22, when I barely went to bars; I felt 40 at 25, when I started accumulating noncollege friends and realized I was partial to older people‚Äôs company. And when I turned 40, I was genuinely relieved, as if I‚Äôd finally achieved some kind of cosmic internal-external temporal alignment.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/why-we-lose-friends-aging-happiness/621305/">From the March 2022 issue: It‚Äôs your friends who break your heart</a></p><p>But over time, I rolled backwards. Other people do this too, just starting at a younger age‚Äî25‚Äîand Rubin has a theory about why this might be. Adolescence and emerging adulthood are times dense with firsts (first kiss, first time having sex, first love, first foray into the world without your parents‚Äô watchful gaze); they are also times when our brains, for a variety of neurodevelopmental reasons, are inclined to feel things more intensely, especially the devil‚Äôs buzz of a good, foolhardy risk. The uniqueness and density of these periods have manifested themselves in other areas of Rubin‚Äôs research. Years ago, he and other researchers showed that adults have an outsize number of memories from the ages of about 15 to 25. They called this phenomenon ‚Äúthe reminiscence bump.‚Äù (This is generally used to explain why we‚Äôre so responsive to the music of our adolescence‚Äîwhich in my case means my iPhone is loaded with a lot more Duran Duran songs than any dignified person should admit.)</p><p>Rubin and Berntsen made a second intriguing discovery in their work on subjective age: People younger than 25 mainly said they felt older than they are, not younger‚Äîwhich, again, makes sense if you‚Äôve had even a passing acquaintance with a 10-year-old, a teenager, a 21-year-old. They‚Äôre eager for more independence and to be taken more seriously; in their head, they‚Äôre ready for both, though their prefrontal cortex is basically a bunch of unripe bananas.</p><p>In Rubin and Berntsen‚Äôs 2006 study, socioeconomic status, gender, and education did not significantly affect their data. One wonders if this has something to do with the fact that they conducted their research in Denmark, a country with substantially less income inequality and racial heterogeneity than our own.</p><p>The picture changes when there‚Äôs more variety: A 2021 meta-analysis of 294 papers examining subjective-age data from across the globe <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-34369-001">found that the discrepancy between chronological age and internal age was greatest in the United States, Western Europe, and Australia/Oceania</a>. Asia had a smaller gap. Africa had the smallest, which could be read as an economic sign (poverty might play a role) but also a cultural one: Elders in collectivist societies are accorded more respect and have more extended-family support.</p><p>‚ÄúCould it be that feeling younger is actually dysfunctional and no longer helping you focus on what‚Äôs going on? That‚Äôs the more complicated question,‚Äù says Hans-Werner Wahl (69 in real life, 55 in his head), a co-author of the meta-analysis. ‚ÄúA lower subjective age may be predictive of better health. But there are other populations around the globe for whom it is not necessary to feel younger. And they‚Äôre not less healthy.‚Äù</p><p>This seems to be the conclusion of Becca Levy, a professor of epidemiology and psychology at the Yale School of Public Health. As a young graduate student, she went to Japan and couldn‚Äôt help noticing not just that people lived longer, but that their attitude toward aging was more positive‚Äîand her decades of research since have shown a very persuasive connection between the two. In the introduction to her book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780063053199"><i>Breaking the Age Code</i></a>, she describes newsstands in Tokyo lined with manga books filled with story lines about older people falling in love. She reports wandering Tokyo on Keiro No Hi, or ‚ÄúRespect for the Aged Day,‚Äù and seeing people in their 70s and 80s lifting weights in the park. She talks about music classes filled with 75-year-olds learning how to play electric slide guitar.</p><p>At first blush, Levy‚Äôs scholarship may seem to quarrel with the literature of subjective age. But maybe it‚Äôs a complement. What underpins them both is an enduring sense of agency: If you mentally view yourself as younger‚Äîif you believe you have a few pivots left‚Äîyou still see yourself as useful; if you believe that aging itself is valuable, an added good, then you also see yourself as useful. In a better world, older people would feel more treasured, certainly. But even now, a good many of us seem capable of combining the two ideas, merging acceptance of our age with a sense of hope. When reading over the many <i>Oldster</i> questionnaires, I was struck by how many people said that their present age was their favorite one. A reassuring number of respondents didn‚Äôt want to trade their hard-earned wisdom‚Äîor humility, or self-acceptance, whatever they had accrued along the way‚Äîfor some earlier moment.</p><p>Recently, I wrote to Margaret Atwood, asking her how old she is in <i>her</i> head. In the few interactions I‚Äôve had with her, she <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/02/conversation-with-margaret-atwood/622845/">seems quite sanguine about aging</a>. Her reply:</p><div><blockquote><p>At 53 you worry about being old compared to younger people. At 83 you enjoy the moment, and time travel here and there in the past 8 decades. You don‚Äôt fret about seeming old, because hey, you really are old! You and your friends make Old jokes. You have more fun than at 53, in some ways. Wait, you‚Äôll see! :)</p></blockquote></div><hr/><p><small><em>This article appears in the April 2023 print edition with the headline ‚ÄúThe Age in Your Head.‚Äù </em><i>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
