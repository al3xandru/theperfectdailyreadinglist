It&#39;s a podcast focused on chatting with developers around how they build and deploy their web apps. It mostly focuses on the &#34;why&#34;, tech stack choices, libraries, workflows, lessons learned, production war stories, etc..</p><p>In my mind I thought it was a good idea but it got so little listeners that I had to abort recording new episodes due to burn out since there was no path forward to ever sustain it by outsourcing the burn out inducing parts. I still think it&#39;s a good idea but I wonder where I went wrong.</p><p>I tried everything I could think of. Guest variety from solo devs to bigger companies like Mux and Dropbox, audio editing to ensure the highest quality I could get for a remote guest&lt;-&gt;host podcast with new guests having assorted mic qualities, removing a lot of &#34;ums&#34; and other fluff but not over editing things to make it unnatural, tags to quickly find tech stacks you care about and a ton of clickable timestamps with a summary of each show that&#39;s skimmable in seconds along with tons of reference links.</p><p>On paper it feels like I did everything I could to make things &#34;good&#34;, but in practice after 100 episodes I had like 200-300 listens per episode which made it no longer viable to continue doing since each episode was about 6 hours of end to end time to put together (finding a guest, editing it, show notes, etc.).</p><p>I learned a ton from chatting with every guest and regret nothing but I overall see the podcast as a total failure since if it didn&#39;t gain any traction on it, it must be trash. I&#39;d love to revive the show because chatting with someone new about what they enjoy working on was really fun.

The stories were highly related to technology, but they usually made sense to people who knew nothing about the technology.</p><p>Even for fans of the podcast, I think the narrowness in topics means that not all fans of <i>Running in Production</i> are a match for most episodes. Comparing it to the <i>Indie Hackers</i> podcast, I&#39;d listen to any episode of IH if the guest sounds interesting because there are a lot of potential things they can say that might be useful to me. Because <i>Running in Production</i> is more narrowly about tech stacks, the percentage of episodes that are relevant to me is much smaller. I&#39;d be interested in hearing about someone talk about their Flask stack because that&#39;s what I use in my business, but if the guest is talking about Elixir or Ruby, I&#39;m unlikely to learn anything useful since I don&#39;t use or plan to use those technologies.

It&#39;s nice to hear this from the perspective of someone who was on the show.<p>I tried to make the story about going from development to production but it is for sure super focused on the technology choices that take you from A to B. There&#39;s the lessons learned which kind of apply to  any tech stack but that&#39;s also near the end of every episode so you have to listen to the whole thing to get there.</p><p>There&#39;s a number of little funny stories hidden away in some episodes. Like one guy was on vacation driving with his wife and ended up switching his web server from Apache to nginx while literally driving as a passenger.</p><p>Deployment is a tricky topic to &#34;promote&#34; because in my opinion deploying a Flask app is almost no different than Rails. If they both have a web + worker + db + cache component, it&#39;s basically the same pieces (especially if you&#39;re using Docker). The hosting provider choice, monitoring, logging, CI / CD workflows, etc. is all the same. When I went into making this show I came at it from the perspective that even if you didn&#39;t use Ruby you could still take away a few nuggets of info from a Rails episode since there&#39;s a lot of overlap but I&#39;m beginning to realize that&#39;s not how this works in real life.</p><p>What I&#39;m thinking now is maybe exactly what you said around being interested in Flask. You care about deploying a Flask app, not deploying in general.</p><p>You are right though, I have no problem sitting down and listening to a 5 hour conversation with John Carmack and Lex because I&#39;m interested in hearing John&#39;s stories. I&#39;m not there to learn the gory details about z-fail stencil shadows. I care about why he ended up inventing that and how it helped him build a cool looking game. When looking at things from that angle, that changes everything. Running in Production is like &#34;90% technical details / 10% story&#34; but &#34;80% stories / 20% technical details&#34; is a more enjoyable listen for a podcast. If this were a technical video course that would be much different, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a podcast.</p><p>Now to be fair, I did try the best I could to avoid going too deep into the technical details about a specific topic because I know most folks will doze off or lose interest because it&#39;s not relatable but still, bouncing around a bunch of technical topics at a surface level is still very tech heavy.

I&#39;m seeing a trend in quite a few comments that are leading me to see that the titles can be much approved upon.<p>That one does read a lot like an ad. For most titles I tried to lead with the service name plus what they do in 70 characters or less. I tried to focus more on what the service does because I figured most folks wouldn&#39;t know what these services are, but if you know what it does it might help you relate to something in your own mind based on a rough idea of &#34;this will be about an invoicing service or an email campaign service, etc.&#34;.</p><p>But, if I do step back and reflect on my own browsing habits for not just podcasts but also YouTube. It comes down to the title. Always.</p><p>It&#39;s an interesting problem in this context. The suggestions here are to mainly make the titles optimized for humans (which I agree with too), but I&#39;m not sure if that will help with gaining traction because the site is already nearly invisible on Google and podcast sites. With that said though, after 2 years and a 100 titles in their current state, my original plan is clearly not working so I have nothing to lose to switch up that strategy. Although I&#39;m not sure if I should go back and change all of the existing titles (they are also tied into the URL on a static site, etc.).

There are dates at the bottom of each episode btw. The last episode was from about a year ago.<p>Promotion wise I tried to organically promote it. Basically if I read a comment on HN or a few sub-reddits I&#39;d leave a non-spammy reply and often end the comment with something that links back to an episode with a timestamped link to the information related to the comment. I also suggested guests share the episode when it goes live. I tweeted out new episodes but I don&#39;t have a huge following.</p><p>Some of those posts on Reddit did pretty well. For example this single post in /r/django fueled almost a year&#39;s worth of guests <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/gddnh0/are_you_running_any_type_of_django_app_in/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/gddnh0/are_you_runn...</a>, and the follow up post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/ifrcd6/a_few_months_ago_i_asked_the_django_community/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/ifrcd6/a_few_months...</a>.</p><p>&gt; You suck at audio engineering. The audio from several samples I listened to ranging from mid-run to the most recent episode were a plosive and fricative nightmare.</p><p>Is this feedback mostly on the guest&#39;s audio or my set up?</p><p>It&#39;s not my full time job but remember each guest is a different person recording their side of the track in their house or office. They&#39;re using whatever bare bones mic set up they have. I pre-assembled a list of recording suggestions before the show to avoid common issues. If money were no object I&#39;d send every guest $150-200 worth of equipment or pay to have studio time in their local area so they can record their side but that&#39;s not realistic for a podcast this size.</p><p>The most recent episode has plosives but if something clips there&#39;s not much I can do since the source audio is messed up. Everyone was recording locally, usually with Audacity to eliminate any network artifacts. Audio editing wise on my side, I usually just run their track through a noise gate while trying not to kill the natural sound of their voice. Sometimes I play a little with an EQ when it&#39;s super clear they have a very trebly voice. Often times I can&#39;t use a compressor to make their volume more consistent because they have a huge amount of room noise that can&#39;t be filtered out without making them sound non-human.</p><p>I&#39;m curious what you think about this episode&#39;s quality <a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/31-mux-is-an-api-based-platform-that-lets-you-process-and-stream-videos" rel="nofollow">https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/31-mux-is-an-api-bas...</a>. This was one where the guest ended up buying a new mic before the podcast (I suggested they pick up an AT-2005 which is a pretty low cost dynamic USB mic, it&#39;s what I use as well). They wanted a better set up for future videos on their own (not just for my show). What you hear there is mostly straight from the source.

It was surprisingly good, but definitely niche.<p>The immediate things that I noticed were the audio quality, your talking speed (often slightly too fast, especially when excited), and saying &#34;like&#34; too much.</p><p>On the plus side, very in depth conversations, great guest, and you have a good interviewing voice and style IMO.</p><p>If you wanted to revive this (which I think might be worth doing), I would work on your speech and audio first. After that you&#39;ll obviously need to figure out the product aspects of this. Marketing and presentation for one. Maybe focus on bigger technologies (languages, fields, etc) for your titles and mainline questions which can bring in the views and you can get into the details and tech stacks in the summaries and long form discussions. You need for every episode to be relevant for most listeners in some meaningful way, otherwise it&#39;s pretty difficult to retain viewers. I&#39;d say most devs aren&#39;t familiar with probably the majority of episodes. Also putting video recordings on YouTube is a must. Some people want video and it&#39;s also a great marketing channel so you&#39;re limiting yourself without that.</p><p>I do think there is something there, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll stumble on to it on accident given how niche it is already - it&#39;ll require some research and trial and error.

See if you can find a way to improve your diction.<p>Another thing, in most episodes, it seems like you have a list of questions that you want to ask, and you quickly go through them, as if you just needed to check them off the list.
And I get it, any application running in production consists of multiple pieces and involves many decisions, but just listing all of the components one by one, turns into reading the specifications on the back of a cereal box.
Maybe you could pick one or two particular aspects of the infrastructure and discuss those in greater depth. Ideally something that either you or your interviewee feel very strongly about. I&#39;d also be interesting if you challenged some of the decisions that went into the infrastructure. All too often you agree too easily with your interviewee.</p><p>Overall however, none of these should be dealbreakers. I still listened to many episodes.

Using filler words is one of those things where it&#39;s easy to notice when editing or listening to it later but near impossible to notice in the middle of a regular conversation. I do try.<p>You are right. I do come into each episode with a number of high level bullets. I always try to stay on track so each episode flows roughly the same. Basically (:D) learning a bit about the service, team size, how it&#39;s built, how it&#39;s deployed and lessons learned. If some of these get skipped, it feels like an unfinished story that goes against the premise of the show? It&#39;s interesting to hear you think otherwise and would rather go deeper on a smaller subset of topics. I thought maybe that would make it even more niched down.</p><p>I&#39;m happy you brought up the part about tech choices. I do try to pry out the &#34;why&#34; on a number of decisions. There&#39;s a fine line here. I kind of wonder which episodes you watched because I thought I challenged them kind of a lot but I definitely keep myself in check to avoid coming off too combative even if they are asked in a friendly way. But I did try to always call out questions that I really feel most listeners would be thinking.

You have to do something special in order to get people to listen. The episode I listened to part of sounded just like it was a couple of normal devs chatting about development. Nothing wrong with that, but it&#39;s not special. If you listen to major podcasts, the people on the podcasts are highly charismatic and it&#39;s easy to listen to them talking about anything. Your podcast, on the other hand, has people who aren&#39;t particularly charismatic, just normal people talking, which I can get anywhere. Podcasts can be informative, but they are a form of entertainment, which means you have to be entertaining.<p>&#34;Devs chatting about development&#34; is also a pretty tight niche. You could probably do better than 200-300 listeners per episode, but not by much. You&#39;re creating a product very few people want. Very few people would come solely for the information being conveyed. Nothing wrong with that, but just as a podcast about European pickles would never get millions of views, no matter how good it is, neither would yours.</p><p>The audio quality was also not great, but this isn&#39;t a major issue if the podcast is entertaining.

The hard part for this style of podcast is finding a constant stream of guests. Often times you have no idea how a person is going to react on a call until you&#39;re already in the call and recording the show. In every episode we jumped on a call, spent a few minutes saying hello and went straight into it.</p><p>I went with my gut in that anyone volunteering to be on the show will be comfortable having a free form conversation. None of it is scripted but I do usually have a couple of bullet points in front of me to cover a range of general topics.</p><p>But, I get where you&#39;re coming from and I&#39;m like that too. I&#39;m for sure going to gravitate towards a more engaging host / guest if I had an option choosing between A and B. It&#39;s really hard to pull this off because if you only have guests on the show who have a public presence on the podcast / interview / YouTube / etc. scene it&#39;ll be much more difficult to find guests as a side project. You may also lose out on some really cool stories. In one episode a couple of guys built and shipped a custom hardware device to remote African villages to help make email more accessible.

I do think video adds a huge element though. It also forces me to be less perfect because it&#39;s really easy to edit audio and you as the listener would never know. Most episodes have literally hundreds of cuts but you can&#39;t tell for most of them, but video is much harder to cut since you visually see the jump cuts.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion!

Count me as someone who truly enjoyed your podcast, and it was my intro to the concept of SaaS as a lifestyle business.

To me that says from a technical standpoint the show is good but you&#39;re not listening to it to be entertained specifically. You may also not be listening to it while doing something else because if technical information is what you&#39;re after, you might be focusing fully on the show?</p><p>Even if my assessment of your specific case is wrong, it got me to think about a couple of new things such as &#34;what type of mood are people in when they tune in?&#34;, &#34;are folks listening to this for pure knowledge, entertainment or something else?&#34;, and &#34;what might someone be doing while they&#39;re listening to the show?&#34;.

Niche things like this are more about _who_ is listening rather than how many people.<p>I&#39;m 100% someone interested in shows like yours, I just didn&#39;t know it existed. One major thing you could probably do right away is invite other people with followings in this area as guests. Popular podcasters are generally annoyed by requests to be on their show, but can be a lot more friendly if you invite them on yours. That&#39;s because you&#39;re doing the work and exposing them to your audience. They&#39;ll likely promote it or might even cross post it if you want to. They might have you on as a guest afterwards, someone with that many interviews is bound to have some interesting things to talk about.</p><p>The episode you posted as an example of audio quality lately seemed more than good enough for me. As far as burn out, I would maybe recommend actually doing <i>less</i> for each episode, at least until you feel like you can outsource the worst parts. What if you did only the most important parts of post, and cut down post production to an hour instead of 5 or 6? Maybe a tool that auto removes silence, umms and ahs, etc could help a bit here too. Descript for example can do a decent amount of this in about 5 minutes. Good enough in my opinion. Cut out as much post work as you can. I bet you your real audience won&#39;t care.</p><p>Part of it could also be just shorter recording times. I prefer longer episodes but it seems like I&#39;m the only one. Editing 30 mins of recording is a lot easier than an hour and a half, and people seem more likely to put on shorter episodes (I guess).</p><p>Also, just skimming a bit of an episode, I think you overdo the formality of the intro. It sounds too scripted and not like your natural self. Skipping from the intro to a later clip of you speaking, you sound much more natural later on. A lot of people will bail out during the intro if they&#39;re just checking you out for the first time and it doesn&#39;t hook them much.</p><p>The titles should reflect more of what&#39;s interesting to the audience, make it the coolest part of whatever they&#39;re doing instead of an elevator length description. Are they hitting high requests per second, doing something bleeding edge, serving a lot of users as a solo dev, etc? Combine that with the most interesting part of their stack for the title. Looking at your show notes I can see this stuff is in there, just make it the title.</p><p>If you&#39;re burning out, try being more selective with guests too. Don&#39;t force it. And don&#39;t look at it as needing X audience numbers or whatever for success. You&#39;re building authority as someone in the industry, getting respect from guests and listeners, being exposed to way more than a normal dev, and so much more. If you&#39;re trying to make a living off of the podcast, you&#39;ll need to go wayyy more generic and attention grabbing. But I say don&#39;t do that. Instead do this thing well and you&#39;ll build a name for yourself with the kinds of people who listen to things like this - people in motion, building things, who are excelling in the field. People who are or will be somebody to respect in the industry.Thats a big deal.</p><p>Finally, please keep making the show, this is a niche that I&#39;ve found surprisingly hard to find good content for. I <i>want</i> the technical details, I want the code talk and the deep dive that most podcasts cut out because &#34;people don&#39;t want to listen to this&#34;. Well, I do and so do plenty of people actually building real things.

Happy to hear you like the show.<p>I&#39;ve done a few cross-posted episodes. That wasn&#39;t the goal of those episodes but some of the episodes are with folks who either have their own podcast or are part of a group podcast. For example, the changelog episode <a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/63-changelog-is-a-news-and-podcast-platform-for-developers" rel="nofollow">https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/63-changelog-is-a-ne...</a>. There&#39;s a number of others.</p><p>I don&#39;t spend too long while editing. About 60-90 minutes of editing per episode when the episode in itself is about that long. I basically edit at 2x speed and quickly chop out the filler words. Any audio processing like cleaning up noise or basic EQ work is a few minutes. The 5-6 hours is the full end to end time from having an empty folder and no guest to a finished mp3 that&#39;s ready to be published.</p><p>The intro and outro were recorded years ago with different audio settings (it&#39;s way too muffled and bass&#39;y compared to any of the last dozens of episodes). I just pad them onto the beginning and end of each episode. They were scripted because I personally don&#39;t like long intros so I was trying to get the core essence of the show out in the least amount of time possible. I will re-record them if I pick the show back up, thanks.</p><p>Definitely going to work on the titles, at least as a homework assignment make new titles for a bunch of the previous episodes even if I don&#39;t publish them. I tried to limit each one to 70 chars or less and out of respect for the guest also wanted to include their product&#39;s name in the title.</p><p>A living would be pushing it but if you work 40-50 hours a week (which I do), dedicating nearly a full day to it is a big investment. To outsource everything properly (an editor who knows enough about the tech to pick what stays in and human vetted transcripts) would be like $300-400 per episode. That&#39;s not counting someone to go through the episodes and make clips to help promote them, that would easily be another $150-250. At 1 episode per week, even without clips that&#39;ll be ~$1,500 a month.</p><p>Getting sponsors is also tricky because it&#39;s not profitable for someone to spend $300 or even $150 per episode for an ad slot when only a few hundred people listen to it. The sponsors will only be happy if they make a return on their investment and that will require having a lot more views.</p><p>You are right though, there&#39;s a lot of ancillary benefits of having the show. That&#39;s partly why I kept going for as long as I did but I noticed that my course sales didn&#39;t really change too much during or after the podcast so I&#39;m not sure it helped get the word out on them. When I look at all of that, I think to myself that it&#39;s a failure because it didn&#39;t move the needle. The conversations were great and I value them a lot which is priceless. Although, a lot of people won&#39;t admit that money does matter. It&#39;s not my primary concern or motivation for the show but money is necessary to continue doing what you like so you can afford to continue doing it.

If you&#39;re getting multiple negative feedbacks on the same topic, you can bank on 10x more people <i>thinking</i> the same thing, but never telling you.<p>I ran a podcast with friends for 13 years. We took it on the chin, and paid (via patreon subs) for an audio engineer to fix the things people complained about in our show. It made a world of difference, but we&#39;ll never be able to break the &#34;first impression&#34; of people who didn&#39;t appreciate it, and unsubbed as a result.

I really enjoy listening to your podcast, but if I may I have some feedback:<p>* Every time your guest specializes on something low-level - like Rebecca Heineman from most recent
episode, David Shayer from last year, and others - you keep saying &#34;yeah, this is a very complicated
subject and I don&#39;t understand anything about it&#34;. Everyone has they own area of expertise, no one
knows everything - and that&#39;s OK. But when you as a host constantly put yourself down, it leaves
a very strange impression on the listener: &#34;well then, invite someone who does&#34;.</p><p>* When you do a voice over for the interview and queue interviewee responses - the whole sequence feels
doctored. It just doesn&#39;t sound as a normal conversation, more like out of context clips forced into
pre-made narrative. Again, I&#39;m not saying it _is_ out of context, it just feels that way.</p><p>Please don&#39;t take these two the wrong way, you&#39;re doing great job.</p><p>Also, I would love to support the show and you seem to have a Patreon account, but prices there
are a bit too steep for a casual listener: $6/14.50/36 per month (that&#39;s in Canadian dollars).
For example, semi-weekly Darknet Diaries has $3/7.50/14.50 tiers.</p><p>In the last episode you&#39;ve announced bonus content with Rebecca, but there&#39;s not even an announcement
on the Patreon page and it&#39;s not clear what tier would allow access to it.</p><p>Sorry for the rant, but I hope it provides outside perspective and you might find it useful.

The podcast being narrative, I&#39;ve gotten complaints about the before, but my feelig is there are so many straight interview podcasts out there. If you don&#39;t like the narration then there are lots of other alternatives.</p><p>Now, it could be that I&#39;m bad at narration. That could totally be true and probably I could improve, but it&#39;s a narrative podcast.</p><p>All content is available to all patreons. Rebecca bonus episode is not out yet. I should post more details and explanation about how that works but bonus episodes episodes come out on the 15th.</p><p>Me not knowing low level stuff is true, so im not sure about that feedback. To me I think admission of my lack of knowledge in an area is good and I&#39;d like to talk about the things I don&#39;t know or my vulnerabilities more often.</p><p>Again, maybe I do it badly, but I think its good to be ok not knowing something and asking questions about it.

I&#39;ve found good results when searching for software episodes in Algorithmic Trading, Math, Netsec, and Game Development podcasts. I also found that searching YouTube with the &gt;20 min filter helps me find podcast-like single discussions/presentations. Youtube autoplay and recommended videos are really good for me.<p>Chat With Traders Podcast has Quant traders and software engineers from time to time. Hearing technical people talk about work and answer questions to a non-technical audience is useful, because podcasts often don&#39;t have PR talk. There are exception to that, here&#39;s a 3 year old episode with Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSDk5PAJss4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSDk5PAJss4</a> <a href="https://chatwithtraders.com/?s=software" rel="nofollow">https://chatwithtraders.com/?s=software</a></p><p>DataSkeptic is an AI, data science, stats, advertising podcast I have found relatively recently. The have had multiple seasons, Seasons labeled, Ad-Tech (current), Physically Distributed, k-means, Time Series, Consensus, Interpretability, Fake News, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence. I really liked the episodes I have heard so far. <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://dataskeptic.com/</a></p><p>I also enjoy old developer conference presentations like ones from Game Developers Conference and Defcon. There are projects to put saved articles through text to speech in batches on the computer, but I have set up classic TTS on my phone instead. Not all articles will work well for conversion though.

The first 20 or so episodes, they had a segment that focused on a specific programming language, the history, application and quirks which was a fun way to learn more about coding and the different tools (languages) available. Theyâve since evolved to cover more practical topics such as test driven development, AI etc. itâs a good one.<p>If youâre a python fan, Talk Python To Me is a great podcast. Covers so many topics within python from libraries, frameworks and special tools.</p><p>The thing I like about these two podcasts is that they donât assume that their listeners are primarily web developers. Since I donât work in the web domain, itâs been tough to find a good podcasts that cover CS more broadly.

E.g., work on blah for 30mins, at 9:30pm before sleeping, or at 6am when awake.

I like to simplify these complex topics to myself by gamifying them a little.<p>Imagine every time you make a conscious decision to do something you expend willpower points. You have a only a set number of willpower points a day.</p><p>Some things you like, some things you don&#39;t, and that depends how much they will cost. Choosing not to do something can also costs points, because it&#39;s a habit.</p><p>Habits are a way to reduce or discount this choice associated cost.</p><p>Now, I recently thought a lot about discipline, motivation, dreaming (for the future) and hope. And I think the problem with discipline is that, everyone has a different definition on it, and it also changes between context. Military discipline is not the same as daily discipline. Soldiers are plenty undisciplined in their daily lives.</p><p>When people talk about discipline they think &#34;doing things that one doesn&#39;t want doing&#34; but it&#39;s really not that simple. It all ties to hopefulness and dreaming for the future.</p><p>And s someone who&#39;s experienced this first hand due to a traumatic childhood: People who don&#39;t value themselves won&#39;t be disciplined for their own sakes, but they can be incredibly disciplined for the sake of others. So, there&#39;s a component of seeing value in what you do, or believe that there is value even if you don&#39;t see it.</p><p>So, like everything in life, discipline is multi faceted.</p><p>As an example, people talk about dopamine and motivation, but I&#39;ve realised that it&#39;s probably closely tied to discipline too. You need to be motivated to be disciplined.</p><p>I&#39;ve recently started becoming more &#34;disciplined&#34; by being incredibly intentional about trying to regulate my dopamine baseline throughout the day. I started doing it to feel less miserable throughout the day, but ended up being more disciplined as a side effect. And I&#39;ve also realised that this has increased my daily &#34;willpower&#34; budget from earlier.

However, then I turn to cold water. There&#39;s some research[^1] that shows that this creates an effect of slow dopamine release.</p><p>Next thing to do is be mindful about what gives you dopamine spikes, and how to not have them too often, since if you do it too much your body becomes &#34;used&#34; too too much dopamine. Basically, biology likes homeostasis, so it will find a way to achieve it.</p><p>This includes not drinking coffee too early too, but around midday/noon, and trying to couple coffee with activities you _want_ to enjoy, but not necessarily do, because coffee increases dopamine levels[^2], so it&#39;s &#34;hacking&#34; your brain to consider this reward-seeking behaviour by pairing the artificical dopamine increase with something you would like to enjoy (like say exercise, or learning a new skill, or work). There&#39;s other obvious benefits of caffeine like improved focus and concentration.</p><p>Now, all this might sound like &#34;too much dopamine,&#34; since it&#39;s very &#34;do this that gives you dopamine, do that that give you dopamine&#34;, but it&#39;s not that you&#39;re getting spikes in dopamine like you get from sex (or masturbation, or cocaine, etc), it&#39;s small releases that you strategically pair with activities that are good for you. Over time as they become habits you won&#39;t have to consume willpower for them, and you won&#39;t have to constantly be so intentional about what you do.</p><p>There&#39;s also the other side of the coin, like &#34;reducing&#34; dopamine. Doing stuff that you don&#39;t enjoy can suck, but sometimes that stuff is good for you. This is where the psychological component comes in. Thank yourself (think of yourself as your future self thanking your past/current self) for engaging in these activities after you do them. Gratitude releases dopamine, too[^3]. So the brain then associates this as reward seeking behaviour, and it becomes less hard in the future. It&#39;s not surprise that drug addicts will go to incredible lengths (I was a drug addict myself, so talking first-hand here) to get their substance of choice even if it&#39;s a giant chore and not enjoyable. Why? Reward-seeking behaviour; the reward is the dopamine, the behaviour is getting and consuming the drug. One could say they&#39;re incredibly disciplined to get that high (it&#39;s a weird way of putting it, but alas).</p><p>I&#39;ve alsoâsomewhat unsuccessfully due to the childhood trauma mentioned earlierâtried to pick up mediation. It&#39;s helped me initially with focus and mindfulness, but caused some emotional problems. They are always there, but for a lack of better word, my chaotic mind was probably somewhat of a &#34;defence&#34; mechanism to mitigate CPTSD[^4]. This is a home-brewed theory me and my therapist came to. Going through the stages of grief for my &#34;lost childhood&#34; and my therapist&#39;s open-mindedness to psilocybin-aided therapy helped resolve this. I&#39;ve done Psilocybin later on my own as well, and I&#39;ve managed to make a lot of progress even on my own (but I have to thank my therapist and myself for developing the mental tools to explore those in a productive way). I wouldn&#39;t blanket recommend psychedelics since I&#39;ve had bad trips too, but they&#39;ve helped me immensely.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;ve went a bit on a tangent here. Back to dopamine control. I can luckily now safely meditate without &#34;relapsing&#34;, and that&#39;s helped a lot with focus, energy and overall willpower. It helps because I can choose what to focus on, and my mind is less ADHD-y. So this means you have to spend less &#34;willpower points&#34; on returning your mind to what matters to your &#34;conscious self&#34; (or ego). I don&#39;t know if I have ADHD or not, maybe; but it&#39;s likely related to the stuff I talked about earlier.</p><p>Meditation isn&#39;t very enjoyable for me, but as I started pairing it with gratitude and started seeing incredible benefits in my daily focus after only just about a week or so of daily 10-minute meditations, it&#39;s started to become enjoyable... Interesting even.[^5]</p><p>Listening to music releases dopamine too, but be careful you don&#39;t do too much of &#34;dopamine layering&#34; since the activity might be less enjoyable in the future without all these &#34;helpers&#34;, or it can offset your baseline too much. So, if you&#39;re at the gym for example, listen to music some days, but do a few days where you are doing it without the music. Try (it isn&#39;t always easy) to enjoy the atmosphere of the environment too.</p><p>Always remember to be grateful to yourself after these activities, too. Progress is sometimes too slow to see, and for progress-minded people, it can be a bit discouraging. But the progress is there, even though you might not realise it immediately. Trust yourself you&#39;re doing the right thing if you know it to be right.</p><p>Also, another big component in this whole thing is energy. So make sure your body is treated well in a holistic matter, not just your brain. The body and the brain are a unit, and we often forget that in our day-to-day-lives, I think. So, make sure you get enough sleep, eat healthy. It helps to take probiotics, especially with modern diets; I take mine daily, but you don&#39;t have to be as rigid with it as I am (but I also have digestive issues and my GP suggested probiotics and multivitamins; it helps a lot for me). Drink water, but depending on where you live don&#39;t drink tap water; buy a Brita water jug (or whatever the equivalent is in your region). It&#39;s easier to make tough decisions when you&#39;re not exhausted, and that means you expend much less willpower points when you do make them.</p><p>It&#39;s late and I might&#39;ve forgotten some stuff. I won&#39;t write much more so I don&#39;t risk you or someone else tl-dr-ing this (as I genuinely believe it&#39;s all good advice) but feel free to ask any follow-up questions if you&#39;re interested.</p><p>[^1]: Nicely summarised by Dr Huberman here <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure-for-health-and-performance/" rel="nofollow">https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure...</a></p><p>[^2]: This is well researched I think; just google &#34;coffee dopamine&#34; and take your pick</p><p>[^3]: This is more nuanced. You really need to do this with your full intent behind it. Murmuring a throwaway &#34;thanks buddy&#34; won&#39;t have the same effect. I combined this with journaling. I like to think __why_ was this good for me. Why do I think it helped me, how could it improve my life. Another big component with me is how I can improve the lives of people around me, since I&#39;m a bit of a people pleaser. So, I like to muse on that too. If my life is good, I&#39;m in a position to help others improve their lives, etc.</p><p>[^4]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_...</a></p><p>[^5]: I recommend reading The Mind Illuminated book.

It&#39;s not just that I&#39;m a workalcoholic, I always end work on time and I always wish I had more time for other things.<p>I have the discipline but I think the key is discipline + actually loving it, loving the thing that you are doing on average. Loving the process of discipline + loving the vision that you are working towards. I think that the passion and inspiration alone are not sufficient because there are always things you don&#39;t want to work on and you may really not feel like it sometimes, on the other hand, discipline for the sake of discipline without appreciation - having to push yourself... no. There must be both push and pull. If you don&#39;t feel any pull or if it&#39;s much weaker than the push then it most likely means that the sacrifice is not worth it or maybe you are doing way too much and not scheduling any time to appreciate the present moment.

To me, it&#39;s certainly not just about programming but the project / product in particular as well as how much ownership / leadership over the thing I would have. If it feels like it&#39;s a part of the bigger picture and I get to develop skills I want to develop, that could be quite fun, even if I was doing it for someone else. My experience to date with other people&#39;s projects was not that exciting though but I liked it because I had the time to work on my own thing alongside. I remember working 2 months on a client&#39;s project exclusively while not having any time for mine, I was approaching 50h/week just for that project. I liked it on average but I remember the last week was tough, I really felt like I had enough and just thinking through some ideas about a potential future product / project felt like gasping for air while being underwater for too long.<p>I think that&#39;s the general theme of this. So long as a significant chunk of the work (i.e. 1/3) is genuinely enjoyable just for what it is, the other, more boring work is also more pleasant because: 1) - it feels like a part of the bigger picture that you like (i.e. whether you are doing something really boring or maybe earning money to buy yourself more time) and 2 - just conditioning, getting good emotions from one part of the work is partially transferred to the boring stuff and it needs to happen on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The fact that there are boring parts to it (which one can still learn to appreciate) provides the contrast and makes the highs much higher. However, there&#39;s also something I did not mention initially. I&#39;m spending considerable time on appreciating the now, I would set aside 40 min every day to do Zen meditation and it really does help with the discipline / will power but perhaps most importantly - appreciating work that&#39;s boring - if I can get myself to enjoy sitting still or walking circles around the room, I can treat boring work not unlike extra Zen practice that sharpens me further. It does not have to be Zen practice but just ensuring that you are spending some time enjoying the now basically every day is critical when you you are often trying to make predictions about the future which is stress and anxiety inducing.

I struggle to watch a movie from start to finish, even one I have been really looking forward to.  I dream of being able to concentrate and work on what I want to do for an entire day.

It&#39;s basically a lifestyle of work and not much else, I set aside some time for a hobby which also involves socializing and that&#39;s why it&#39;s 60h/week (63h/week being theoretical max if nothing comes up) and not 70h/week.<p>Hitting the time on a regular day (not every day is like that) requires ongoing effort to sustain it. I spend 20 min / day doing time tracking and performance analysis (I think it makes more time than it costs). So for example if I want to hit 10h on a day which is purely dedicated to work, I wake up at 6, I end work at 8 and go to sleep at 9:30. That gives me 14h between 6 and 8, so it means that the combined time for the morning and midday routines must be under 4h. I don&#39;t stress about doing too little work on any given day, but I will always look at it the next day and consider what I could do better with the execution of the previous day . Then it mostly becomes a habit, I would just do it like a robot. Not every day is like that, but most are.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your disability. I don&#39;t know much about ADHD but perhaps you would find the following tips useful. You could look into Zen meditation - a good book with the how is 3 Pillars of Zen, feel free to discard the supernatural stuff and just focus on regular practice. One of the main benefits of Zen practice is increasing your attention span. It&#39;s extremely challenging to sustain focus on nothing and I still struggle with this despite doing it regularly for 5 years. It could be as simple as counting exhales and resetting the count every 10 breaths, expect to lose track fast but you get better at it with regular practice and this directly translates to your attention span when doing other things. Maybe you could also benefit from journaling - try to successively increase work blocks by a small amount every week or so and keep track of it. Other tips: avoid scrolling social media, get good sleep - you may need up to 8.5h of bed time / 8h of sleep, it&#39;s easy to be chronically sleep depleted without being aware about it and everything is much harder without good sleep, do quick breaks while working, i.e. 1 minute pause every 15 min just looking at the timer (not email!).

    2 motivation 
    3 intention 
    4 discipline 
    5 habit 
    6 passion
</code></pre>
discipline is great but it&#39;s the part that takes willpower and it&#39;s not sustainable so if you don&#39;t like to do something you need the willpower to do it. it&#39;s not gonna last ever day for years. that people have to suffer to sustain things is misguided advice. the math doesn&#39;t check out.<p>sibling comment is correct here, discipline is necessary but only 1/6 of the framework. for long term sustainability we need habits plus higher order reasons to want to do it. passion ideally, or boosts of positive energy from inspiration and motivation.

Drop it the second it&#39;s not fun anymore. Or take a trip. Ensure you&#39;re spending time on friends and family. Just waste time sometimes and don&#39;t feel bad about it. Focus on a task thats not actually the top priority but is more fun now and again.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t get easier. You pick up more tasks and harder tasks. You can make things that were once harder things easier things, but you&#39;re always going to be working hard if you&#39;re improving. Make sure you do it sustainably -- it&#39;s a marathon and not a sprint. If you rush to retire but don&#39;t build a life you want to retire to it will just make it worse.

I may be productive for a week, but sooner or later, something is going to happen that will allow me to procrastinate. When this happens, I&#39;m like an addict, I&#39;m not satisfied with a small dosage, and all limits are off. I know I should be working instead of watching Youtube.

Experiment and try different methods. Don&#39;t confuse it with trying multiple implementations of one method - if you tried two to-do list apps and it didn&#39;t work for you, skip the to-do lists and move to something else. My method is body doubling, but YMMV. Once you find a method that works for you, revisit previous productivity methods - they may supplement your productivity

Medication can help, but even with strategies, tactics, and therapy, there is still brain chemistry at play. Medication can help, but has its trade-offs and isn&#39;t a silver bullet.<p>Self-discipline is also more costly. You can brute-force your way through tasks with ADHD, but it is more taxing on your overall energy. Those with ADHD typically experience impulses often and it&#39;s harder for them to ignore. Forcing yourself to ignore them requires extra energy. It&#39;s not sustainable to do all the time. It&#39;s hard for those without ADHD to truly understand what that&#39;s like.</p><p>In addition to impulsivity, executive dysfunction affecting starting tasks or work is also a big challenge.

After two years of IFS therapy my ADD is pretty much non-existent and my executive functioning is better than most people I know.<p>My hunch is that for a lot of people, ADD is a result of growing up in a home that felt unstable so they never gained a basic internal sense of stability that you need for things like task switching or staying focused.

I don&#39;t think the question here is whether trauma is mimicking ADHD or ADHD is a result of trauma, either in general, or in any particular case.<p>I think people lean into the personality traits, &#39;neurotype&#39;, cognitive styles, talents, and inherent tendencies they have as kids when it comes to coping with trauma. You use the tools you have. If you have ADHD and a situation is unbearable, hyperfocus is a tool you haveâ or at least a pattern you can fall intoâ that can prevent you from being overwhelmed by the feelings that weigh on you when that situation is on your mind. It would be shocking to me if ADHDers didn&#39;t often end up relying on features of ADHD to adapt to traumatic situations.</p><p>These things are interrelated in people who have both, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s generally easy (or necessary) to pick apart &#39;which is which&#39; when it comes to a specific behavior or experience.

Let&#39;s say I have to mail a package at the post office. I&#39;ve got to write the address, pack it all up and then take it to the post office.  At 9am in the morning I genuinely feel like I&#39;m on the cusp of doing it.  I glance at my watch &#34;Oh, it&#39;s midday, better each lunch&#34;. No to worry, I&#39;ll get the package done right after lunch.  4pm rolls around and I realize that I might miss the closing time of the post of office so I rush to tape it up, write the address and hurry down there. I send it just in time.  At any time of the day you could have asked me &#34;Are you going to send that package now?&#34; and I would honestly say &#34;Yes, right away!&#34; but somehow it doesn&#39;t happen. On one level I know myself well enough to have seen this play out hundreds of times, but I still think this time will be different. It still feels like I&#39;m just about to send that package.<p>This happened on a much larger scale when I was in university. I had 18 months for my dissertation. Each week that went by I planned to write a small chunk of it, just to get going.  In the end I wrote the entire thing a week before the deadline with my professor literally sitting next to me making me do it.</p><p>&gt; I suspect you will be less likely to feel that inability to get around to do the tasks that you know to be important to do it if you fail in a way that life itself, the universe, hurts you for the failure, as opposed to your boss saying &#34;you&#39;re fired for showing up late&#34;.</p><p>This is true up to a point.  What ADHD people need is consequences ASAP.  Your boss checking in on you every hour and providing constant pressure is much more effective than a meeting at the end of the month where your boss blows his top and fires you because you&#39;ve done very little.

It is the case that one may not have a mindset of exclusively complaint, as one may have developed a capacity for more gratitude through the effort of being conscious. As long as there is any energy being exerted for complaint, that is energy that can be conserved and utilized for higher purpose.</p><p>For a complaint to reach all the way through the body and out the mouth, it must have already been processed through the brain. Complaining in all forms is a type of negative expression, and drains energy. The OP was commenting about how they complain going to the gym, at the gym, coming home from the gym, and while showering after the gym. I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking for as a definition of &#39;mindset of complaint&#39;, but this I&#39;d suggest this is suitable.</p><p>You can think of complaining, an expression of negativity, as basically a polar opposite of gratitude. To begin cultivating something of a higher order, it will help to attempt to &#39;reconcile&#39; the feeling of the two by feeling them both simultaneously. When you feel like complaining, or catch yourself doing so, make attempts to begin feeling gratitude. You&#39;ll soon find the gratitude will replace the complaining. After doing this enough, you will develop enough sensitivity and acumen to begin actually feeling both sensations at the same time, holding onto the &#39;complaining&#39; feeling, while reaching toward the gratitude as well. Over time, you will be able to find yourself &#39;integrating&#39; the two faster and faster, nearer the moment the feelings come into consciousness. Eventually (years), your &#39;complaining&#39; will be supplanted and you will have a different mode of experience.

In particular, it seems to lower friction for hard things by helping you see more clearly the reality of why you&#39;re struggling with doing things, and why <i>not</i> doing them is often worse in the long run.</p><p>&gt; <i>I would challenge that from the getgo.</i></p><p>To clarify, what are you challenging, specifically? The idea that small changes are easier to execute than large ones?</p><p>This has been the subject of deep exploration across many walks of life, and on the personal improvement front is at the center of books like Atomic Habits, which itself is based on a foundation of research. The reason small changes work is that we absorb them into our daily routines until they no longer require active thinking to accomplish.</p><p>Part of what happens is that you also start confronting the bad reasoning you&#39;ve been using to justify not acting. Embarrassingly, I had to re-establish basic habits like brushing my teeth. Clarity through mindfulness led to the realization that avoiding the tiny annoyance of doing this each day would be far less painful than the eventual dental issues I would otherwise suffer. I always <i>knew</i> that, but pausing to actually think clearly is what turned that knowing into a deep realization.</p><p>- [0] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_meditation" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_meditation</a> (linking to Wikipedia as a shortcut to the extensive references in the article if you&#39;re curious).

The fact that people manage to get into that state undermines the premise of your challenge. If what you say is true, no one would rise to the level of âalready doingâ, which is an act that started at some point.</p><p>&gt; <i>In every case where I see someone change there&#39;s so many factors that went into it that just obviously would lead you to understand how it&#39;s intuitive that they would have done so.</i></p><p>This is called life. The causes and conditions of change are tautologically the reason that people change, yes. But is this a surprise?</p><p>If there is nothing to change or no reason to change, why would someone try?</p><p>By definition, if someone finds themselves in a position that would benefit from change, that falls under your âother things of the sortâ.</p><p>The factors that lead to change are innumerable and different for each person. Some of the causes include exposure to new information. For me, I stumbled on some useful books like âLearned Optimismâ, which details the history of the discovery of learned helplessness. It opened my eyes to some things about myself that I didnât understand, and was one of many things that led to a change of mind.</p><p>Causes and conditions that lead to change include reading comment threads like this one. Exposing yourself to information that challenges your assumptions is another potent change agent.
