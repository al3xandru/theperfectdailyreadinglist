	                    <p><em>This is an updated version of a post we originally published in 2020. You can read the original version <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure-2020/">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>The growth of the data infrastructure industry has continued unabated since we published a set of reference architectures in <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure-2020/"><span>late 2020</span></a><span>. Nearly all key industry metrics hit record highs during the past year, and new product categories appeared faster than most data teams could reasonably keep track. Even the </span><a href="http://databricks.com/blog/2021/11/02/databricks-sets-official-data-warehousing-performance-record.html"><span>benchmark</span></a> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/industry-benchmarks-and-competing-with-integrity/"><span>wars</span></a><span> and billboard battles returned.</span></p>
<p><span>To help data teams stay on top of the changes happening in the industry, we’re publishing in this post an updated set of data infrastructure architectures. They show the current best-in-class stack across both analytic and operational systems, as gathered from numerous operators we spoke with over the last year. Each architectural blueprint includes a summary of what’s changed since the prior version.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll also attempt to explain </span><i><span>why</span></i><span> these changes are taking place. We argue that core data processing systems have remained relatively stable over the past year, while supporting tools and applications have proliferated rapidly. We explore the hypothesis that</span><i><span> platforms</span></i><span> are beginning to emerge in the data ecosystem, and that this helps explain the particular patterns we’re seeing in the evolution of the data stack.</span></p>
<p><span>To compile this work, we relied again on input from dozens of data experts, who are listed at the end of this post. This simply wouldn’t exist without them, so thank you!</span></p>
<h2><span>Updated reference architectures</span></h2>
<p><span>Before we get too deep in the details, here are the latest architecture diagrams. These were compiled with the help of leading data practitioners, based on what they run internally and what they recommend for new deployments.</span></p>
<p><span>The first view shows a unified overview across all data infrastructure use cases:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5053" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5053"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Unified-Data-Infrastructure-2.0-1.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" src="https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Unified-Data-Infrastructure-2.0-1.png?resize=2000%2C1236&amp;ssl=1" alt="Unified Data Infrastructure (2.0)" width="2000" height="1236" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5053">Notes: Excludes OLTP, log analysis, and SaaS analytics apps.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The second view zooms in on machine learning, which is a complex and increasingly independent tool chain:</p>

<p><span>In the rest of this post, we’ll comment on what’s changed since v1 of the data stack and explore the underlying root causes.</span></p>
<h2><span>Changelog</span></h2>
<h3><span>What hasn’t changed: Stability in the core</span></h3>
<p><span>Despite the frenzy of data infrastructure activity over the past year, it’s surprising to see — in some ways — how little has changed.</span></p>
<p><span>In our first post, we drew a distinction between </span><i><span>analytic</span></i><span> systems that support data-driven decision-making and </span><i><span>operational</span></i><span> systems that power data-driven products. We then mapped these categories to three patterns, or blueprints, often implemented by leading data teams.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Graphic-AnalyticSystems-OpSystems.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Graphic-AnalyticSystems-OpSystems.png?resize=2000%2C866&amp;ssl=1" alt="Analytic Systems and Op Systems" width="2000" height="866" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p><span>One of the key questions was whether these architectural patterns would converge. A year later, that doesn’t seem to have taken place.</span></p>
<p><span>In particular, the analytic and operational ecosystems both continue to thrive. Cloud data warehouses like Snowflake have grown rapidly, focused largely on SQL users and business intelligence use cases. But adoption of other technologies has also accelerated — data lakehouses like Databricks, for instance, are adding customers faster than ever. Many data teams we spoke with confirmed that heterogeneity is likely here to stay in the data stack.</span></p>
<p><span>Other core data systems — namely, ingestion and transformation — have proven similarly durable. This is especially visible in the modern business intelligence pattern, where the combination of Fivetran and dbt (or similar technologies) has become nearly ubiquitous. But it’s also true to an extent in operational systems, where </span><i><span>de facto</span></i><span> standards like Databricks/Spark, Confluent/Kafka, and Astronomer/Airflow have emerged.</span></p>
<h3><span>What’s new: Cambrian explosion</span></h3>
<p><span>Around the stable core, the data stack has evolved rapidly over the past year. Broadly speaking, we’ve seen the most activity in two areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>New </span><i><span>tools</span></i><span> designed to support key data processes and workflows, like data discovery, observability, or ML model auditing</span></li>
<li><span>New </span><i><span>applications</span></i><span> that allow data teams and business users to generate value from data in new, more powerful ways, like data workspaces, reverse ETL, and ML application frameworks</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We’re also seeing the introduction of some new technologies designed to enhance core data-processing systems. Notably, there has been active debate around the metrics layer in the analytical ecosystem and the lakehouse pattern for operational systems — both of which are converging toward useful definitions and architectures.</span></p>
<h3><span>Updated blueprints</span></h3>
<p><span>With that context, we’ll go into detail on each of the major data infrastructure blueprints. Each section below shows an updated diagram (diff’d against v1 of the stack) and an analysis of key changes. These sections are intended primarily as reference for data teams implementing these stacks, and reading them isn’t necessary to follow the rest of the post.</span></p>
<h4><span>Blueprint 1: Modern Business Intelligence</span></h4>
<p><i><span>Cloud-native business intelligence for companies of all sizes</span></i></p>
<figure id="attachment_5054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5054"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blueprint-1_-Modern-Business-Intelligence-1.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blueprint-1_-Modern-Business-Intelligence-1.png?resize=2000%2C1236&amp;ssl=1" alt="Blueprint 1: Modern Business Intelligence" width="2000" height="1236" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5054">Darker boxes are new or meaningfully changed since v1 of the architecture in 2020; lighter colored boxes have remained largely the same. Gray boxes are considered less relevant to this blueprint.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>What hasn’t changed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The combination of data replication (like Fivetran), cloud data warehouses (like Snowflake), and SQL-based data modeling (with dbt) continues to form the core of this pattern. Adoption for these technologies has grown meaningfully, prompting the funding and early growth of new competitors (e.g. Airbyte and Firebolt).</span></li>
<li><span>Dashboards continue to be the most common application used in the output layer, including Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, and newer entrants like Superset.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>What’s new:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>There has been a surge of interest in the </span><b>metrics layer</b><span>,</span> <span>a system providing a standard set of definitions on top of the data warehouse. This has been hotly debated, including what capabilities it should have, which vendor(s) should own it, and what spec it should follow. So far, we’ve seen several credible pure-play products (like Transform and Supergrain), plus expansion into this category by dbt.</span></li>
<li><b>Reverse ETL </b><span>vendors have grown meaningfully, particularly Hightouch and Census. The purpose of these products is to update operational systems, like CRM or ERP, with outputs and insights derived from the data warehouse.</span></li>
<li><span>Data teams are showing stronger interest in </span><b>new applications</b><span> to augment their standard dashboards, especially data workspaces (like Hex). Broadly speaking, new apps are likely the result of increasing standardization in cloud data warehouses — once data is cleanly structured and easy to access, data teams naturally want to do more with it.</span></li>
<li><b>Data discovery and observability</b> companies have proliferated and raised substantial amounts of capital (especially Monte Carlo and Bigeye). While the benefits of these products are clear — i.e. more reliable data pipelines and better collaboration — adoption is still relatively early, as customers discover relevant use cases and budgets. (Technical note: although there are several credible new vendors in data discovery — e.g. Select Star, Metaphor, Stemma, Secoda, Castor — we have excluded seed-stage companies from the diagram in general.)</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Blueprint 2: Multimodal Data Processing</span></h4>
<p><i><span>Evolved data lakes supporting both analytic and operational use cases – also known as modern infrastructure for Hadoop refugees</span></i></p>
<figure id="attachment_5055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5055"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blueprint-2_-Multimodal-Data-Processing-1.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blueprint-2_-Multimodal-Data-Processing-1.png?resize=2000%2C1236&amp;ssl=1" alt="Blueprint 2: Multimodal Data Processing" width="2000" height="1236" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5055">Note: Darker boxes are new or meaningfully changed since v1 of the architecture in 2020; lighter colored boxes have remained largely the same. Gray boxes are considered less relevant to this blueprint.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>What hasn’t changed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Core systems in data processing (e.g. Databricks, Starburst, and Dremio), transport (e.g. Confluent and Airflow), and storage (AWS) continue to grow rapidly and form the backbone of this blueprint.</span></li>
<li><span>Multimodal data processing remains diverse by design, allowing companies to adopt the systems best suited to their particular needs across both analytics and operational data applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>What’s new:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>There is growing recognition and clarity for the </span><b>lakehouse</b><span> architecture. We’ve seen this approach supported by a wide range of vendors (including AWS, Databricks, Google Cloud, Starburst, and Dremio) and data warehouse pioneers. The fundamental value of the lakehouse is to pair a robust storage layer with an array of powerful data processing engines like Spark, Presto, Druid/Clickhouse, Python libraries, etc.</span></li>
<li><span>The </span><b>storage layer</b><span> itself is getting an upgrade. While technologies like Delta, Iceberg, and Hudi are not new, they are seeing accelerated adoption and are being built into commercial products. Some of these technologies (particularly Iceberg) also interoperate with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake. If heterogeneity is here to stay, this is likely to become a key part of the multimodal data stack.</span></li>
<li>There may be an uptick in adoption taking place for <b>stream processing</b> (i.e., real-time analytical data processing). While first-generation technologies like Flink still haven’t gone mainstream, new entrants with simpler programming models (like Materialize and Upsolver) are gaining early adoption, and, anecdotally, usage of stream processing products from incumbents Databricks and Confluent has also started to accelerate.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Blueprint 3: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</span></h4>
<p><i><span>Stack for robust development, testing, and operation of machine learning models</span></i></p>
<figure id="attachment_5025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5025"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blueprint-3_-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blueprint-3_-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning.png?resize=2000%2C1406&amp;ssl=1" alt="Blueprint 3: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" width="2000" height="1406" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5025">Note: Darker boxes are new or meaningfully changed since v1 of the architecture in 2020; lighter colored boxes have remained largely the same. Gray boxes are considered less relevant to this blueprint.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>What hasn’t changed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Tooling for model development is largely similar today compared to 2020, including the major cloud vendors (e.g. Databricks and AWS), ML frameworks (e.g. XGBoost and PyTorch), and experiment management tools (e.g. Weights &amp; Biases and Comet)</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Experiment management has effectively subsumed model visualization and tuning as independent categories.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Building and operating a machine learning stack is complicated and requires specialized expertise. This blueprint is not for the faint of heart — and productionizing AI is still challenging for many data teams.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>What’s new:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The ML industry is consolidating around a </span><b>data-centric approach</b><span>, emphasizing sophisticated data management over incremental modeling improvements. This has several implications:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Rapid growth for </span><b>data labeling</b><span> (e.g. Scale and Labelbox) and growing interest in </span><b>closed-loop data engines, </b><span>largely modeled on Tesla’s Autopilot data pipelines.</span></li>
<li><span>Increased adoption for </span><b>feature stores </b><span>(e.g. Tecton), for both batch and real-time use cases, as a means to develop production-grade ML data in a collaborative way.</span></li>
<li><span>Revived interest in </span><b>low-code ML</b><span> solutions (like Continual and MindsDB) that at least partially automate the ML modeling process. These newer solutions focus on bringing new users (i.e. analysts and software developers) into the ML market.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Use of </span><b>pre-trained models</b><span> is becoming the default, especially in NLP, and providing tailwinds to companies like OpenAI and Hugging Face. There are still meaningful problems to solve here around fine-tuning, cost, and scaling.</span></li>
<li><span>Operations tools for ML (sometimes called MLops) are becoming more mature, built around </span><b>ML monitoring</b><span> as the most in-demand use case and immediate budget. Meanwhile, a raft of new operational tools — including, notably, </span><b>validation </b><span>and </span><b>auditing </b><span>— are appearing, with the ultimate market still to be determined.</span></li>
<li>There is increased focus on how developers can seamlessly integrate ML models into applications, including through <b>pre-built APIs</b> (e.g. OpenAI), <b>vector databases</b> (e.g. Pinecone), and more opinionated frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span>The data platform hypothesis</span></h2>
<p><span>To recap: Over the past year, the data infrastructure stack has seen substantial stability in core systems and rapid proliferation of supporting tools and applications.</span><span>To help explain why this might be happening, we introduce here the idea of </span><i><span>data platforms</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>What is a platform?</span></h3>
<p><span>The word “platform” is overloaded in the data ecosystem, often used by internal teams to describe their whole tech stacks or by </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=data+platform"><span>vendors</span></a><span> to sell loosely connected product suites.</span></p>
<p><span>In software more broadly, a platform is something other developers can build on top of. Platforms generally provide limited value on their own — most users have no interest, for instance, in accessing the guts of Windows or iOS. But they provide an array of benefits, like a common programming interface and a large installed base, that allow developers to build and distribute the applications users ultimately care about.</span></p>
<p><span>The defining trait of a platform, from an industry standpoint, is mutual dependence — both technically and economically — between an influential platform provider and a large pool of 3rd-party developers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Graphic-BenThompson.png?ssl=1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Graphic-BenThompson.png?resize=2000%2C986&amp;ssl=1" alt="Basic Platform Framework" width="2000" height="986" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<h3><span>What is a <em>data</em> platform?</span></h3>
<p><span>Historically, the data stack has not been an obvious fit for the definition of a platform. Mutual dependence existed — among ETL, data warehouse, and reporting vendors, for instance — but the integration model tended to be one-to-one, rather than one-to-many, and was supplemented heavily by professional services.</span></p>
<p><span>According to a number of data experts we spoke with, this may be starting to change.</span></p>
<p><span>The platform hypothesis argues that the “backend” of the data stack — roughly defined as data ingestion, storage, processing, and transformation — has started to consolidate around a relatively small set of cloud-based vendors. As a result, customer data is being collected in a standard set of systems, and vendors are investing heavily to make this data easily accessible to other developers — as a fundamental design principle in systems like Databricks, and via SQL standards plus </span><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/welcome-to-snowpark-new-data-programmability-for-the-data-cloud/"><span>custom compute APIs</span></a><span> in systems like Snowflake.</span></p>
<p><span>“Frontend” developers, in turn, have taken advantage of this single point of integration to build out a range of new applications. They rely on clean, joined data in the data warehouse/lakehouse, without worrying about the underlying details of how it got there. A single customer may buy and build many applications on top of one core data system. We’re even starting to see traditional enterprise systems, like financial or product analytics, being rebuilt with a “warehouse-native” architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>The picture might look like this:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Graphic-Emerging-Data-Platform.png?resize=2000%2C1977&amp;ssl=1" alt="Emerging Data Platform " width="2000" height="1977" data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>
<p><span>To be clear, this doesn’t mean that OLTP databases or other important backend technologies will disappear in the near future. But native integration with OLAP systems may become a critical component of application development. And over time, more and more business logic and application functionality could transition to this model. We may see a whole class of new products built on this data platform.</span></p>
<h3><span>The emergence of data apps?</span></h3>
<p><span>The data platform hypothesis is still very much open to debate. However, we </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> seeing an increase in sophisticated vertical SaaS solutions implemented as horizontal layers on top of the data platforms. And so, while early, we’d argue that the changes taking place in the data stack are at least </span><i><span>consistent </span></i><span>with the idea that platforms are taking hold.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many reasons, for example, that companies like Snowflake and Databricks have become stable pieces of the data stack, including great products, capable sales teams, and low-friction deployment models. But there’s also a case to be made that their stickiness is reinforced by platform dynamics — once a customer has built and/or integrated a range of data applications with one of these systems, it often doesn’t make sense to transition off.</span></p>
<p><span>A similar argument can be made for the surge of new data infrastructure products in recent years. The typical explanations for this trend have to do with vast troves of data, increasing corporate budgets, and a glut of VC funding. But those things have arguably been true for decades. The reason we’re seeing so many new products appear now may have to do with platforms — namely, that it’s never been easier to get a new data application adopted, and it’s never been more important to properly maintain the platform.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, the platform hypothesis provides some predictive power in terms of competitive dynamics. At scale, platforms can be extremely valuable. Core data systems vendors may be competing aggressively today not just for current budgets, but for a long-term platform position. Eye-popping valuations for data ingestion and transformation companies — or especially heated debates over new categories like the metrics layer or reverse ETL — also make more sense if you believe they are a core part of the emerging data platform.</span></p>
<h2><span>Looking ahead</span></h2>
<p><span>We’re still in the early stages of defining the analytical and operational data platform, and the pieces of the platform are in flux. As such, it’s probably more useful as an analogy than as a strict definition. But it may be a useful tool to filter signal from noise, and to help develop a sense of why the market is moving the way it is. Data teams now have more tools, resources, and organizational momentum behind them than at any point (likely) since the invention of the database. And we’re very excited to see how the app layer evolves on top of the emerging platforms.</span></p>

<p>This article will teach you about some not famous but useful Java libraries. This is the second article in the “useful &amp; unknown” series. The previous one described several attractive, but not well-known Java features. You can read more about it <a href="https://piotrminkowski.com/2022/01/05/useful-unknown-java-features/">here</a>.<span id="more-13954"></span></p>



<p>Today we will focus on Java libraries. Usually, we use several external libraries in our projects – even if we do not include them directly. For example, Spring Boot comes with a defined set of dependencies included by starters. Assuming we include e.g. <code>spring-boot-starter-test</code> we include libraries like <code>mockito</code>, <code>junit-jupiter</code> or <code>hamcrest</code> at the same time. Of course, these are well-known libraries for the community. </p>



<p>In fact, there are a lot of different Java libraries. Usually, I don’t need to use many of them (or even I need none of them) when working with the frameworks like Spring Boot or Quarkus. However, there are some very interesting libraries that may be useful everywhere. I’m writing about them because you might not hear about any of them. I’m going to introduce 5 of my favorite “useful &amp; unknown” Java libraries. Let’s begin!</p>







<h2>Source Code</h2>



<p>If you would like to try it by yourself, you may always take a look at my source code. To do that you need to clone my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/piomin/spring-boot-tips.git">repository</a>. Yo can also find the example  Then you should just follow my instructions.</p>







<h2>Instancio</h2>



<p>On the first fire will go <a href="https://www.instancio.org/">Instancio</a>. How do you generate test data in your unit tests? Instancio will help us with that. It aims to reduce the time and lines of code spent on manual data setup in unit tests. It instantiates and populates objects with random data, making our tests more dynamic. We can generate random data with Instancio but at the same, we can set custom data in a particular field.</p>



<p>Before we start with Instancio, let’s discuss our data model. Here’s the first class – <code>Person</code>:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Person {

   private Long id;
   private String name;
   private int age;
   private Gender gender;
   private Address address;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Our class contains three simple fields (<code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>), a single enum <code>Gender</code> , and the instance of the <code>Address</code> class. Gender is just a simple enum containing <code>MALE</code> and <code>FEMALE</code> values. Here’s the implementation of the <code>Address</code> class:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Address {

   private String country;
   private String city;
   private String street;
   private int houseNumber;
   private int flatNumber;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Now, let’s create a test to check whether the <code>Person</code> service will successfully add and obtain objects from the store. We want to generate random data for all the fields except the <code>id</code> field, which is set by the service. Here’s our test:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Test
void addAndGet() {
   Person person = Instancio.of(Person.class)
             .ignore(Select.field(Person::getId))
             .create();
   person = personService.addPerson(person);
   Assertions.assertNotNull(person.getId());
   person = personService.findById(person.getId());
   Assertions.assertNotNull(person);
   Assertions.assertNotNull(person.getAddress());
}</code></pre>







<p>The values generated for my test run are visible below. As you see, the <code>id</code> field equals <code>null</code>. Other fields contain random values generated per the field type (<code>String</code> or <code>int</code>).</p>



<pre><code lang="json">Person(id=null, name=ATDLCA, age=2619, gender=MALE, 
address=Address(country=FWOFRNT, city=AIRICCHGGG, street=ZZCIJDZ, houseNumber=5530, flatNumber=1671))</code></pre>







<p>Let’s see how we can generate several objects with Instancio. Assuming we need 5 objects in the list for our test, we can do that in the following way. We will also set a constant value for the <code>city</code> fields inside the <code>Address</code> object. Then we would like to test the method for searching objects by the city name.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Test
void addListAndGet() {
   final int numberOfObjects = 5;
   final String city = &#34;Warsaw&#34;;
   List&lt;Person&gt; persons = Instancio.ofList(Person.class)
           .size(numberOfObjects)
           .set(Select.field(Address::getCity), city)
           .create();
   personService.addPersons(persons);
   persons = personService.findByCity(city);
   Assertions.assertEquals(numberOfObjects, persons.size());
}</code></pre>







<p>Let’s take a look at the last example. The same as before, we are generating a list of objects – this time 100. We can easily specify the additional criteria for generated values. For example, I would like to set a value for the <code>age</code> field between 18 and 65.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Test
void addGeneratorAndGet() {
   List&lt;Person&gt; persons = Instancio.ofList(Person.class)
            .size(100)
            .ignore(Select.field(Person::getId))
            .generate(Select.field(Person::getAge), 
                      gen -&gt; gen.ints().range(18, 65))
            .create();
   personService.addPersons(persons);
   persons = personService.findAllGreaterThanAge(40);
   Assertions.assertTrue(persons.size() &gt; 0);
}</code></pre>







<p>That’s just a small set of customizations, that Instancio offers, for test data generation. You can read more about other options in their <a href="https://www.instancio.org/user-guide/#project-goals">docs</a>.</p>







<h2>Datafaker</h2>



<p>The next library we will discuss today is <a href="https://www.datafaker.net/">Datafaker</a>. The purpose of this library is quite similar to the previous one. We need to generate random data. However, this time we need data that looks like real data. From my perspective, it is useful for demo presentations or examples running somewhere. </p>



<p>Datafaker creates fake data for your JVM programs within minutes, using our wide range of more than 100 data providers. This can be very helpful when generating test data to fill a database, generating data for a stress test, or anonymizing data from production services. Let’s include it in our dependencies.</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;net.datafaker&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;datafaker&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.7.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>We will expand our sample model a little. Here’s a new class definition. The Contact class contains two fields <code>email</code> and <code>phoneNumber</code>. We will validate both these fields using the <code>jakarta.validation</code> module.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Contact {

   @Email
   private String email;
   @Pattern(regexp=&#34;\\d{2}-\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}&#34;)
   private String phoneNumber;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Here’s a new version of our <code>Person</code> class that contains the <code>Contant</code> object instance:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Person {

   private Long id;
   private String name;
   private int age;
   private Gender gender;
   private Address address;
   @Valid
   private Contact contact;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Now, let’s generate fake data for the <code>Person</code> object. We can create localized data just by setting the Locale object in the Faker constructor <strong>(1)</strong>. For me, it is Poland 🙂 There are a lot of providers for the standard values. To set <code>email</code> we need to use the <code>Internet</code> provider <strong>(2)</strong>. There is a dedicated provider for generating phone numbers <strong>(3)</strong>, addresses <strong>(4)</strong>, and person names <strong>(5)</strong>. You can see a full list of available providers <a href="https://www.datafaker.net/documentation/providers/">here</a>. After creating test data, we can run the test that adds a new <code>Person</code> verified on the server side.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class PersonsControllerTests {

   @Autowired
   private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

   @Test
   void add() {
      Faker faker = new Faker(Locale.of(&#34;pl&#34;)); // (1)
      Contact contact = new Contact();
      contact.setEmail(faker.internet().emailAddress()); // (2)
      contact.setPhoneNumber(faker.phoneNumber().cellPhone()); // (3)
      Address address = new Address();
      address.setCity(faker.address().city()); // (4)
      address.setCountry(faker.address().country());
      address.setStreet(faker.address().streetName());
      int number = Integer
         .parseInt(faker.address().streetAddressNumber());
      address.setHouseNumber(number);
      number = Integer.parseInt(faker.address().buildingNumber());
      address.setFlatNumber(number);
      Person person = new Person();
      person.setName(faker.name().fullName()); // (5)
      person.setContact(contact);
      person.setAddress(address);
      person.setGender(Gender.valueOf(
         faker.gender().binaryTypes().toUpperCase()));
      person.setAge(faker.number().numberBetween(18, 65));

      person = restTemplate
         .postForObject(&#34;/persons&#34;, person, Person.class);
      Assertions.assertNotNull(person);
      Assertions.assertNotNull(person.getId());
   }

}</code></pre>







<p>Here’s the data generated during my test. I think you can find one inconsistency here (the <code>country</code> field) 😉</p>



<pre><code lang="json">Person(id=null, name=Stefania Borkowski, age=51, gender=FEMALE, address=Address(country=Ekwador, city=Sępopol, street=al. Chudzik, houseNumber=882, flatNumber=318), contact=Contact{email=&#39;gilbert.augustyniak@gmail.com&#39;, phoneNumber=&#39;69-733-43-77&#39;})</code></pre>







<p>Sometimes you need to generate a more predictable random result. It’s possible to provide a seed value in the Faker constructor. When providing a seed, the instantiation of Fake objects will always happen in a predictable way, which can be handy for generating results multiple times. Here’s a new version of my <code>Faker</code> object declaration:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">Faker faker = new Faker(Locale.of(&#34;pl&#34;), new Random(0));</code></pre>







<h2>JPA Streamer</h2>



<p>Our next library is related to JPA queries. If you like to use Java streams and you are building apps that interact with databases through JPA or Hibernate, the <a href="https://jpastreamer.org/">JPA Streamer</a> library may be an interesting choice. It is a library for expressing JPA/Hibernate/Spring queries using standard Java streams. JPA Streamer instantly gives Java developers type-safe, expressive and intuitive means of obtaining data in database applications. Moreover, you can easily integrate it with Spring Boot and <a href="https://code.quarkus.io/?extension-search=origin:other%20jpastreamer">Quarkus</a>. Firstly, let’s include JPA Streamer in our dependencies:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.speedment.jpastreamer&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jpastreamer-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>If you want to integrate it with Spring Boot you need to add one additional dependency:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.speedment.jpastreamer.integration.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-jpastreamer-autoconfigure&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>In order to test JPA Streamer, we need to create an example entities model. </p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Entity
public class Employee {

   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Integer id;
   private String name;
   private String position;
   private int salary;
   @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private Department department;
   @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private Organization organization;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>There are also two other entities: <code>Organization</code> and <code>Department</code>. Here are their definitions:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Entity
public class Department {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Integer id;
   private String name;
   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &#34;department&#34;)
   private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employees;
   @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private Organization organization;

   // getters and setters ...
}

@Entity
public class Organization {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Integer id;
   private String name;
   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &#34;organization&#34;)
   private Set&lt;Department&gt; departments;
   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &#34;organization&#34;)
   private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employees;

   // getters and setters ...
}</code></pre>







<p>Now, we can prepare some queries using the Java streams pattern. In the following fragment of code, we are searching an entity by id and then joining two relations. By default, it is LEFT JOIN, but we can customize it when calling the <code>joining()</code> method. In the following fragment of code, we join <code>Department</code> and <code>Organization</code>, which are in <code>@ManyToOne</code> a relationship with the Employee entity. Then we filter the result, convert the object to the DTO and pick the first result.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@GetMapping(&#34;/{id}&#34;)
public EmployeeWithDetailsDTO findById(@PathVariable(&#34;id&#34;) Integer id) {
   return streamer.stream(of(Employee.class)
           .joining(Employee$.department)
           .joining(Employee$.organization))
        .filter(Employee$.id.equal(id))
        .map(EmployeeWithDetailsDTO::new)
        .findFirst()
        .orElseThrow();
}</code></pre>







<p>Of course, we can call many other Java stream methods. In the following fragment of code, we count the number of employees assigned to the particular department.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@GetMapping(&#34;/{id}/count-employees&#34;)
public long getNumberOfEmployees(@PathVariable(&#34;id&#34;) Integer id) {
   return streamer.stream(Department.class)
         .filter(Department$.id.equal(id))
         .map(Department::getEmployees)
         .mapToLong(Set::size)
         .sum();
}</code></pre>







<p>If you are looking for a detailed explanation and more examples with JPA Streamer you can my <a href="https://piotrminkowski.com/2021/07/13/express-jpa-queries-as-java-streams/">article</a> dedicated to that topic.</p>







<h2>Blaze Persistence</h2>



<p><a href="https://persistence.blazebit.com/">Blaze Persistence</a> is another library from the JPA and Hibernate area. It allows you to write complex queries with a consistent builder API with rich Criteria API for JPA providers. That’s not all. You can also use the Entity-View module dedicated to DTO mapping. Of course, you can easily integrate with Spring Boot or Quarkus. If you want to use all Blaze Persistence modules in your app it is worth adding the <code>dependencyManagement</code> section in your Maven <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-bom&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.6.8&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;    
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</code></pre>







<p>Personally, I’m using Blaze Persistence for DTO mapping. Thanks to the integration with Spring Boot we can replace Spring Data Projections with Blaze Persistence Entity-Views. It will be especially useful for more advanced mappings since Blaze Persistence offers more features and better performance for that. You can read a detailed comparison in the following <a href="https://modern-sql.com/blog/2020-09/blaze-persistence">article</a>. If we want to integrate Blaze Persistence Entity-Views with Spring Data we should add the following dependencies:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-integration-spring-data-2.7&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-integration-hibernate-5.6&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-entity-view-processor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>Then, we need to create an interface with getters for mapped fields. It should be annotated with the <code>@EntityView</code> that refers to the target entity class. In the following example, we are mapping two entity fields <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> to the single fields inside the <code>PersonDTO</code> object. In order to map the entity’s primary key we should use the <code>@IdMapping</code> annotation.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@EntityView(Person.class)
public interface PersonView {

   @IdMapping
   Integer getId();
   void setId(Integer id);

   @Mapping(&#34;CONCAT(firstName,&#39; &#39;,lastName)&#34;)
   String getName();
   void setName(String name);

}</code></pre>







<p>We can still take advantage of the Spring Data repository pattern. Our repository interface needs to extend the <code>EntityViewRepository</code> interface.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public interface PersonViewRepository 
    extends EntityViewRepository&lt;PersonView, Integer&gt; {

    PersonView findByAgeGreaterThan(int age);

}</code></pre>







<p>We also need to provide some additional configuration and enable Blaze Persistence in the main or the configuration class:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBlazeRepositories
@EnableEntityViews
public class PersonApplication {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(PersonApplication.class, args);
   }

}</code></pre>







<h2>Hoverfly</h2>



<p>Finally, the last of the Java libraries on my list – <a href="https://hoverfly.io/">Hoverfly</a>. To be more precise, we will use the Java version of the Hoverfly library documented <a href="https://docs.hoverfly.io/projects/hoverfly-java/en/latest/">here</a>. It is a lightweight service virtualization tool that allows you to stub or simulate HTTP(S) services. <strong>Hoverfly Java</strong> is a native language binding that gives you an expressive API for managing Hoverfly in Java. It gives you a Hoverfly class which abstracts away the binary and API calls, a DSL for creating simulations, and a JUnit integration for using it within unit tests.</p>



<p>Ok, there are some other, similar libraries… but somehow I really like Hoverfly 🙂 It is a simple, lightweight library that may perform tests in different modes like simulation, spying, capture, or diffing. You can use  Java DSL to build request matchers to response mappings. Let’s include the latest version of Hoverfly in the Maven dependencies:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;io.specto&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;hoverfly-java-junit5&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;0.14.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>Let’s assume we have the following method in our Spring <code>@RestController</code>. Before returning a ping response for itself, it calls another service under the address <code>http://callme-service:8080/callme/ping</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@GetMapping(&#34;/ping&#34;)
public String ping() {
   String response = restTemplate
     .getForObject(&#34;http://callme-service:8080/callme/ping&#34;, 
                   String.class);
   LOGGER.info(&#34;Calling: response={}&#34;, response);
   return &#34;I&#39;m caller-service &#34; + version + &#34;. Calling... &#34; + response;
}</code></pre>







<p>Now, we will create the test for our controller. In order to use Hoverfly to intercept outgoing traffic we register HoverflyExtension <strong>(1)</strong>. Then we may the Hoverfly object to create a request mather and simulate an HTTP response <strong>(2)</strong>. The simulated response body is <code>I&#39;m callme-service v1</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootTest(properties = {&#34;VERSION = v2&#34;}, 
    webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@ExtendWith(HoverflyExtension.class) // (1)
public class CallerCallmeTest {
    
   @Autowired
   TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

   @Test
   void callmeIntegration(Hoverfly hoverfly) {
      hoverfly.simulate(
            dsl(service(&#34;http://callme-service:8080&#34;)
               .get(&#34;/callme/ping&#34;)
               .willReturn(success().body(&#34;I&#39;m callme-service v1.&#34;)))
      ); // (2)
      String response = restTemplate
         .getForObject(&#34;/caller/ping&#34;, String.class);
      assertEquals(&#34;I&#39;m caller-service v2. Calling... I&#39;m callme-service v1.&#34;, response);
   }
}</code></pre>







<p>We can easily customize Hovefly behavior with the <code>@HoverflyConfig</code> annotation. By default, Hoverfly works in proxy mode. Assuming we want it to act as a web server we need to set the property <code>webserver</code> to <code>true</code> <strong>(1)</strong>. After that, it will listen for requests on  <code>localhost</code> and the port indicated by the <code>proxyPort</code> property.  In the next step, we will also enable Spring Cloud <code>@LoadBalancedClient</code> to configure a static list of target URLs instead of dynamic discovery <strong>(2)</strong>. Finally, we can create a Hoverfly test. This time we are intercepting traffic from the web server listening on the <code>localhost:8080</code> <strong>(3)</strong>.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = 
   SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@HoverflyCore(config = 
   @HoverflyConfig(logLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG, 
                    webServer = true, 
                    proxyPort = 8080)) // (1)
@ExtendWith(HoverflyExtension.class)
@LoadBalancerClient(name = &#34;account-service&#34;, 
                    configuration = AccountServiceConf.class) // (2)
public class GatewayTests {

    @Autowired
    TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Test
    public void findAccounts(Hoverfly hoverfly) {
        hoverfly.simulate(dsl(
            service(&#34;http://localhost:8080&#34;)
                .andDelay(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).forAll()
                .get(any())
                .willReturn(success(&#34;[{\&#34;id\&#34;:\&#34;1\&#34;,\&#34;number\&#34;:\&#34;1234567890\&#34;,\&#34;balance\&#34;:5000}]&#34;, &#34;application/json&#34;)))); // (3)

        ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response = restTemplate
                .getForEntity(&#34;/account/1&#34;, String.class);
        Assertions.assertEquals(200, response.getStatusCodeValue());
        Assertions.assertNotNull(response.getBody());
    }
}</code></pre>







<p>Here’s the load balancer client configuration created just for the test purpose.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">class AccountServiceInstanceListSuppler implements 
    ServiceInstanceListSupplier {

    private final String serviceId;

    AccountServiceInstanceListSuppler(String serviceId) {
        this.serviceId = serviceId;
    }

    @Override
    public String getServiceId() {
        return serviceId;
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;List&lt;ServiceInstance&gt;&gt; get() {
        return Flux.just(Arrays
                .asList(new DefaultServiceInstance(serviceId + &#34;1&#34;, 
                        serviceId, 
                        &#34;localhost&#34;, 8080, false)));
    }
}</code></pre>







<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>As you probably figured out, I used all that Java libraries with Spring Boot apps. Although Spring Boot comes with a defined set of external libraries, sometimes we may need some add-ons. The Java libraries I presented are usually created to solve a single, particular problem like e.g. test data generation. It’s totally fine from my perspective. I hope you will find at least one position from my list useful in your projects.  </p>

    <p>“Doc comments” are comments that appear immediately before top-level package,
const, func, type, and var declarations with no intervening newlines.
Every exported (capitalized) name should have a doc comment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/go/doc">go/doc</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/go/doc/comment">go/doc/comment</a> packages
provide the ability to extract documentation from Go source code,
and a variety of tools make use of this functionality.
The <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Show_documentation_for_package_or_symbol"><code>go</code> <code>doc</code></a>
command looks up and prints the doc comment for a given package or symbol.
(A symbol is a top-level const, func, type, or var.)
The web server <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev</a> shows the documentation
for public Go packages (when their licenses permit that use).
The program serving that site is
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">golang.org/x/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite</a>,
which can also be run locally to view documentation for private modules
or without an internet connection.
The language server <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gopls</a>
provides documentation when editing Go source files in IDEs.</p>
<p>The rest of this page documents how to write Go doc comments.</p>
<h2 id="package">Packages</h2>
<p>Every package should have a package comment introducing the package.
It provides information relevant to the package as a whole
and generally sets expectations for the package.
Especially in large packages, it can be helpful for the package comment
to give a brief overview of the most important parts of the API,
linking to other doc comments as needed.</p>
<p>If the package is simple, the package comment can be brief.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Package path implements utility routines for manipulating slash-separated
// paths.
//
// The path package should only be used for paths separated by forward
// slashes, such as the paths in URLs. This package does not deal with
// Windows paths with drive letters or backslashes; to manipulate
// operating system paths, use the [path/filepath] package.
package path
</code></pre>
<p>The square brackets in <code>[path/filepath]</code> create a <a href="#links">documentation link</a>.</p>
<p>As can be seen in this example, Go doc comments use complete sentences.
For a package comment, that means the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/go/doc/#Package.Synopsis">first sentence</a>
begins with “Package <name>”.</name></p>
<p>For multi-file packages, the package comment should only be in one source file.
If multiple files have package comments, they are concatenated to form one
large comment for the entire package.</p>
<h2 id="cmd">Commands</h2>
<p>A package comment for a command is similar, but it describes the behavior
of the program rather than the Go symbols in the package.
The first sentence conventionally begins with the name of the program itself,
capitalized because it is at the start of a sentence.
For example, here is an abridged version of the package comment for <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/gofmt">gofmt</a>:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Gofmt formats Go programs.
It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment.
Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file,
it operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in
that directory, recursively. (Files starting with a period are ignored.)
By default, gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:

    gofmt [flags] [path ...]

The flags are:

    -d
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file&#39;s formatting is different than gofmt&#39;s, print diffs
        to standard output.
    -w
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file&#39;s formatting is different from gofmt&#39;s, overwrite it
        with gofmt&#39;s version. If an error occurred during overwriting,
        the original file is restored from an automatic backup.

When gofmt reads from standard input, it accepts either a full Go program
or a program fragment. A program fragment must be a syntactically
valid declaration list, statement list, or expression. When formatting
such a fragment, gofmt preserves leading indentation as well as leading
and trailing spaces, so that individual sections of a Go program can be
formatted by piping them through gofmt.
*/
package main
</code></pre>
<p>The beginning of the comment is written using
<a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">semantic linefeeds</a>,
in which each new sentence or long phrase is on a line by itself,
which can make diffs easier to read as code and comments evolve.
The later paragraphs happen not to follow this convention
and have been wrapped by hand.
Whatever is best for your code base is fine.
Either way, <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> and <code>pkgsite</code> rewrap doc comment text when printing it.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ go doc gofmt
Gofmt formats Go programs. It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for
alignment. Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font.

Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file, it
operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all .go files in that
directory, recursively. (Files starting with a period are ignored.) By default,
gofmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

Usage:

    gofmt [flags] [path ...]

The flags are:

    -d
        Do not print reformatted sources to standard output.
        If a file&#39;s formatting is different than gofmt&#39;s, print diffs
        to standard output.
...
</code></pre>
<p>The indented lines are treated as preformatted text:
they are not rewrapped and are printed in code font
in HTML and Markdown presentations.
(The <a href="#syntax">Syntax</a> section below gives the details.)</p>
<h2 id="type">Types</h2>
<p>A type’s doc comment should explain what each instance of that type represents or provides.
If the API is simple, the doc comment can be quite short.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package zip

// A Reader serves content from a ZIP archive.
type Reader struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>By default, programmers should expect that a type is safe for use only by
a single goroutine at a time.
If a type provides stronger guarantees, the doc comment should state them.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package regexp

// Regexp is the representation of a compiled regular expression.
// A Regexp is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines,
// except for configuration methods, such as Longest.
type Regexp struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Go types should also aim to make the zero value have a useful meaning.
If it isn’t obvious, that meaning should be documented. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package bytes

// A Buffer is a variable-sized buffer of bytes with Read and Write methods.
// The zero value for Buffer is an empty buffer ready to use.
type Buffer struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>For a struct with exported fields, either the doc comment or per-field comments
should explain the meaning of each exported field.
For example, this type’s doc comment explains the fields:</p>
<pre><code>package io

// A LimitedReader reads from R but limits the amount of
// data returned to just N bytes. Each call to Read
// updates N to reflect the new amount remaining.
// Read returns EOF when N &lt;= 0.
type LimitedReader struct {
    R   Reader // underlying reader
    N   int64  // max bytes remaining
}
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, this type’s doc comment leaves the explanations to per-field comments:</p>
<pre><code>package comment

// A Printer is a doc comment printer.
// The fields in the struct can be filled in before calling
// any of the printing methods
// in order to customize the details of the printing process.
type Printer struct {
    // HeadingLevel is the nesting level used for
    // HTML and Markdown headings.
    // If HeadingLevel is zero, it defaults to level 3,
    // meaning to use &lt;h3&gt; and ###.
    HeadingLevel int
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>As with packages (above) and funcs (below), doc comments for types
start with complete sentences naming the declared symbol.
An explicit subject often makes the wording clearer,
and it makes the text easier to search, whether on a web page
or a command line.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ go doc -all regexp | grep pairs
pairs within the input string: result[2*n:2*n+2] identifies the indexes
    FindReaderSubmatchIndex returns a slice holding the index pairs identifying
    FindStringSubmatchIndex returns a slice holding the index pairs identifying
    FindSubmatchIndex returns a slice holding the index pairs identifying the
$
</code></pre>
<h2 id="func">Funcs</h2>
<p>A func’s doc comment should explain what the function returns
or, for functions called for side effects, what it does.
Named arguments or results can be referred to directly in
the comment, without any special syntax like backquotes.
(A consequence of this convention is that names like <code>a</code>,
which might be mistaken for ordinary words, are typically avoided.)
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package strconv

// Quote returns a double-quoted Go string literal representing s.
// The returned string uses Go escape sequences (\t, \n, \xFF, \u0100)
// for control characters and non-printable characters as defined by IsPrint.
func Quote(s string) string {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre><code>package os

// Exit causes the current program to exit with the given status code.
// Conventionally, code zero indicates success, non-zero an error.
// The program terminates immediately; deferred functions are not run.
//
// For portability, the status code should be in the range [0, 125].
func Exit(code int) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>If a doc comment needs to explain multiple results,
naming the results can make the doc comment more understandable,
even if the names are not used in the body of the function.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package io

// Copy copies from src to dst until either EOF is reached
// on src or an error occurs. It returns the total number of bytes
// written and the first error encountered while copying, if any.
//
// A successful Copy returns err == nil, not err == EOF.
// Because Copy is defined to read from src until EOF, it does
// not treat an EOF from Read as an error to be reported.
func Copy(dst Writer, src Reader) (n int64, err error) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Conversely, when the results don’t need to be named in the doc comment,
they are usually omitted in the code as well, like in the <code>Quote</code> example above,
to avoid cluttering the presentation.</p>
<p>These rules all apply both to plain functions and to methods.
For methods, using the same receiver name avoids needless
variation when listing all the methods of a type:</p>
<pre><code>$ go doc bytes.Buffer
package bytes // import &#34;bytes&#34;

type Buffer struct {
    // Has unexported fields.
}
    A Buffer is a variable-sized buffer of bytes with Read and Write methods.
    The zero value for Buffer is an empty buffer ready to use.

func NewBuffer(buf []byte) *Buffer
func NewBufferString(s string) *Buffer
func (b *Buffer) Bytes() []byte
func (b *Buffer) Cap() int
func (b *Buffer) Grow(n int)
func (b *Buffer) Len() int
func (b *Buffer) Next(n int) []byte
func (b *Buffer) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error)
...
</code></pre>
<p>This example also shows that top-level functions returning a type <code>T</code> or pointer <code>*T</code>,
perhaps with an additional error result,
are shown alongside the type <code>T</code> and its methods,
under the assumption that they are <code>T</code>’s constructors.</p>
<p>By default, programmers can assume that a top-level func
is safe to call from multiple goroutines;
this fact need not be stated explicitly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as noted in the previous section,
using an instance of a type in any way,
including calling a method, is typically assumed
to be restricted to a single goroutine at a time.
If the methods that are safe for concurrent use
are not documented in the type’s doc comment,
they should be documented in per-method comments.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package sql

// Close returns the connection to the connection pool.
// All operations after a Close will return with ErrConnDone.
// Close is safe to call concurrently with other operations and will
// block until all other operations finish. It may be useful to first
// cancel any used context and then call Close directly after.
func (c *Conn) Close() error {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that func and method doc comments focus on
what the operation returns or does,
detailing what the caller needs to know.
Special cases can be particularly important to document.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package math

// Sqrt returns the square root of x.
//
// Special cases are:
//
//  Sqrt(+Inf) = +Inf
//  Sqrt(±0) = ±0
//  Sqrt(x &lt; 0) = NaN
//  Sqrt(NaN) = NaN
func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Doc comments should not explain internal details
such as the algorithm used in the current implementation.
Those are best left to comments inside the function body.
It may be appropriate to give asymptotic time or space bounds
when that detail is particularly important to callers.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package sort

// Sort sorts data in ascending order as determined by the Less method.
// It makes one call to data.Len to determine n and O(n*log(n)) calls to
// data.Less and data.Swap. The sort is not guaranteed to be stable.
func Sort(data Interface) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because this doc comment makes no mention of which sorting algorithm is used,
it is easier to change the implementation to use a different algorithm in the future.</p>
<h2 id="const">Consts</h2>
<p>Go’s declaration syntax allows grouping of declarations,
in which case a single doc comment can introduce a group of related constants,
with individual constants only documented by short end-of-line comments.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package scanner // import &#34;text/scanner&#34;

// The result of Scan is one of these tokens or a Unicode character.
const (
    EOF = -(iota + 1)
    Ident
    Int
    Float
    Char
    ...
)
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes the group needs no doc comment at all. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package unicode // import &#34;unicode&#34;

const (
    MaxRune         = &#39;\U0010FFFF&#39; // maximum valid Unicode code point.
    ReplacementChar = &#39;\uFFFD&#39;     // represents invalid code points.
    MaxASCII        = &#39;\u007F&#39;     // maximum ASCII value.
    MaxLatin1       = &#39;\u00FF&#39;     // maximum Latin-1 value.
)
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, ungrouped constants typically warrant a full
doc comment starting with a complete sentence. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package unicode

// Version is the Unicode edition from which the tables are derived.
const Version = &#34;13.0.0&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>Typed constants are displayed next to the declaration of their type
and as a result often omit a const group doc comment in favor of
the type’s doc comment.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package syntax

// An Op is a single regular expression operator.
type Op uint8

const (
    OpNoMatch        Op = 1 + iota // matches no strings
    OpEmptyMatch                   // matches empty string
    OpLiteral                      // matches Runes sequence
    OpCharClass                    // matches Runes interpreted as range pair list
    OpAnyCharNotNL                 // matches any character except newline
    ...
)
</code></pre>
<p>(See <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax#Op" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax#Op</a> for the HTML presentation.)</p>
<h2 id="var">Vars</h2>
<p>The conventions for variables are the same as those for constants.
For example, here is a set of grouped variables:</p>
<pre><code>package fs

// Generic file system errors.
// Errors returned by file systems can be tested against these errors
// using errors.Is.
var (
    ErrInvalid    = errInvalid()    // &#34;invalid argument&#34;
    ErrPermission = errPermission() // &#34;permission denied&#34;
    ErrExist      = errExist()      // &#34;file already exists&#34;
    ErrNotExist   = errNotExist()   // &#34;file does not exist&#34;
    ErrClosed     = errClosed()     // &#34;file already closed&#34;
)
</code></pre>
<p>And a single variable:</p>
<pre><code>package unicode

// Scripts is the set of Unicode script tables.
var Scripts = map[string]*RangeTable{
    &#34;Adlam&#34;:                  Adlam,
    &#34;Ahom&#34;:                   Ahom,
    &#34;Anatolian_Hieroglyphs&#34;:  Anatolian_Hieroglyphs,
    &#34;Arabic&#34;:                 Arabic,
    &#34;Armenian&#34;:               Armenian,
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Go doc comments are written in a simple syntax that supports
paragraphs, headings, links, lists, and preformatted code blocks.
To keep comments lightweight and readable in source files,
there is no support for complex features like font changes or raw HTML.
Markdown aficionados can view the syntax as a simplified subset of Markdown.</p>
<p>The standard formatter <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/gofmt">gofmt</a> reformats doc comments
to use a canonical formatting for each of these features.
Gofmt aims for readability and user control over how comments
are written in source code but will adjust presentation to make
the semantic meaning of a particular comment clearer,
analogous to reformatting <code>1+2 * 3</code> to <code>1 + 2*3</code> in ordinary source code.</p>
<p>Directive comments such as <code>//go:generate</code> are not
considered part of a doc comment and are omitted from
rendered documentation.
Gofmt moves directive comments to the end of the doc comment,
preceded by a blank line.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>package regexp

// An Op is a single regular expression operator.
//
//go:generate stringer -type Op -trimprefix Op
type Op uint8
</code></pre>
<p>A directive comment is a line matching the regular expression
<code>//(line |extern |export |[a-z0-9]+:[a-z0-9])</code>.
Tools that define their own directives should use the form
<code>//toolname:directive</code>.</p>
<p>Gofmt removes leading and trailing blank lines in doc comments.</p>
<h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
<p>A paragraph is a span of unindented non-blank lines.
We’ve already seen many examples of paragraphs.</p>
<p>A pair of consecutive backticks (` U+0060)
is interpreted as a Unicode left quote (“ U+201C),
and a pair of consecutive single quotes (&#39; U+0027)
is interpreted as a Unicode right quote (” U+201D).</p>
<p>Gofmt preserves line breaks in paragraph text: it does not rewrap the text.
This allows the use of <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">semantic linefeeds</a>,
as seen earlier.
Gofmt replaces duplicated blank lines between paragraphs
with a single blank line.
Gofmt also reformats consecutive backticks or single quotes
to their Unicode interpretations.</p>
<h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
<p>A heading is a line beginning with a number sign (U+0023) and then a space and the heading text.
To be recognized as a heading, the line must be unindented and set off from adjacent paragraph text
by blank lines.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Package strconv implements conversions to and from string representations
// of basic data types.
//
// # Numeric Conversions
//
// The most common numeric conversions are [Atoi] (string to int) and [Itoa] (int to string).
...
package strconv
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<pre><code>// #This is not a heading, because there is no space.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// # because it is multiple lines.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// because it is also multiple lines.
//
// The next paragraph is not a heading, because there is no additional text:
//
// #
//
// In the middle of a span of non-blank lines,
// # this is not a heading either.
//
//     # This is not a heading, because it is indented.
</code></pre>
<p>The # syntax was added in Go 1.19.
Before Go 1.19, headings were identified implicitly by single-line paragraphs
satisfying certain conditions, most notably the lack of any terminating punctuation.</p>
<p>Gofmt reformats <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/51082-godocfmt.md#headings" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">lines treated as implicit headings</a>
by earlier versions of Go to use # headings instead.
If the reformatting is not appropriate—that is, if the line was not meant to be a heading—the easiest
way to make it a paragraph is to introduce terminating punctuation
such as a period or colon, or to break it into two lines.</p>
<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<p>A span of unindented non-blank lines defines link targets
when every line is of the form “[Text]: URL”.
In other text in the same doc comment,
“[Text]” represents a link to URL using the given text—in HTML,
&lt;a href=“URL”&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Package json implements encoding and decoding of JSON as defined in
// [RFC 7159]. The mapping between JSON and Go values is described
// in the documentation for the Marshal and Unmarshal functions.
//
// For an introduction to this package, see the article
// “[JSON and Go].”
//
// [RFC 7159]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159
// [JSON and Go]: https://golang.org/doc/articles/json_and_go.html
package json
</code></pre>
<p>By keeping URLs in a separate section,
this format only minimally interrupts the flow of the actual text.
It also roughly matches the Markdown
<a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#shortcut-reference-link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">shortcut reference link format</a>,
without the optional title text.</p>
<p>If there is no corresponding URL declaration,
then (except for doc links, described in the next section)
“[Text]” is not a hyperlink, and the square brackets are preserved
when displayed.
Each doc comment is considered independently:
link target definitions in one comment do not affect other comments.</p>
<p>Although link target definition blocks may be interleaved with
ordinary paragraphs, gofmt moves all link target definitions to
the end of the doc comment,
in up to two blocks: first a block containing all the link targets
that are referenced in the comment, and then a block
containing all the targets <em>not</em> referenced in the comment.
The separate block makes unused targets easy
to notice and fix (in case the links or the definitions have typos)
or to delete (in case the definitions are no longer needed).</p>
<p>Plain text that is recognized as a URL is automatically linked in HTML renderings.</p>
<h3 id="doclinks">Doc links</h3>
<p>Doc links are links of the form “[Name1]” or “[Name1.Name2]” to refer
to exported identifiers in the current package, or “[pkg]”,
“[pkg.Name1]”, or “[pkg.Name1.Name2]” to refer to identifiers in other
packages.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>package bytes

// ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF and appends it to the buffer, growing
// the buffer as needed. The return value n is the number of bytes read. Any
// error except [io.EOF] encountered during the read is also returned. If the
// buffer becomes too large, ReadFrom will panic with [ErrTooLarge].
func (b *Buffer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64, err error) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The bracketed text for a symbol link
can include an optional leading star, making it easy to refer to
pointer types, such as [*bytes.Buffer].</p>
<p>When referring to other packages, “pkg” can be either a full import path
or the assumed package name of an existing import. The assumed package
name is either the identifier in a renamed import or else
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/internal/imports#ImportPathToAssumedName" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the name assumed by
goimports</a>.
(Goimports inserts renamings when that assumption is not correct, so
this rule should work for essentially all Go code.)
For example, if the current package imports encoding/json,
then “[json.Decoder]” can be written in place of “[encoding/json.Decoder]”
to link to the docs for encoding/json’s Decoder.
If different source files in a package import different packages using the same name,
then the shorthand is ambiguous and cannot be used.</p>
<p>A “pkg” is only
assumed to be a full import path if it starts with a domain name (a
path element with a dot) or is one of the packages from the standard
library (“[os]”, “[encoding/json]”, and so on).
For example, <code>[os.File]</code> and <code>[example.com/sys.File]</code> are documentation links
(the latter will be a broken link),
but <code>[os/sys.File]</code> is not, because there is no os/sys package in the standard library.</p>
<p>To avoid problems with
maps, generics, and array types, doc links must be both preceded and
followed by punctuation, spaces, tabs, or the start or end of a line.
For example, the text “map[ast.Expr]TypeAndValue” does not contain
a doc link.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>A list is a span of indented or blank lines
(which would otherwise be a code block,
as described in the next section)
in which the first indented line begins with
a bullet list marker or a numbered list marker.</p>
<p>A bullet list marker is a star, plus, dash, or Unicode bullet
(*, +, -, •; U+002A, U+002B, U+002D, U+2022)
followed by a space or tab and then text.
In a bullet list, each line beginning with a bullet list
marker starts a new list item.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>package url

// PublicSuffixList provides the public suffix of a domain. For example:
//   - the public suffix of &#34;example.com&#34; is &#34;com&#34;,
//   - the public suffix of &#34;foo1.foo2.foo3.co.uk&#34; is &#34;co.uk&#34;, and
//   - the public suffix of &#34;bar.pvt.k12.ma.us&#34; is &#34;pvt.k12.ma.us&#34;.
//
// Implementations of PublicSuffixList must be safe for concurrent use by
// multiple goroutines.
//
// An implementation that always returns &#34;&#34; is valid and may be useful for
// testing but it is not secure: it means that the HTTP server for foo.com can
// set a cookie for bar.com.
//
// A public suffix list implementation is in the package
// golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix.
type PublicSuffixList interface {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>A numbered list marker is a decimal number of any length
followed by a period or right parenthesis, then a space or tab, and then text.
In a numbered list, each line beginning with a number list marker starts a new list item.
Item numbers are left as is, never renumbered.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>package path

// Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path
// by purely lexical processing. It applies the following rules
// iteratively until no further processing can be done:
//
//  1. Replace multiple slashes with a single slash.
//  2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
//  3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)
//     along with the non-.. element that precedes it.
//  4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path:
//     that is, replace &#34;/..&#34; by &#34;/&#34; at the beginning of a path.
//
// The returned path ends in a slash only if it is the root &#34;/&#34;.
//
// If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean
// returns the string &#34;.&#34;.
//
// See also Rob Pike, “[Lexical File Names in Plan 9].”
//
// [Lexical File Names in Plan 9]: https://9p.io/sys/doc/lexnames.html
func Clean(path string) string {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>List items only contain paragraphs, not code blocks or nested lists.
This avoids any space-counting subtlety as well as questions about
how many spaces a tab counts for in inconsistent indentation.</p>
<p>Gofmt reformats bullet lists to use a dash as the bullet marker,
two spaces of indentation before the dash,
and four spaces of indentation for continuation lines.</p>
<p>Gofmt reformats numbered lists to use a single space before the number,
a period after the number, and again
four spaces of indentation for continuation lines.</p>
<p>Gofmt preserves but does not require a blank line between a list and the preceding paragraph.
It inserts a blank line between a list and the following paragraph or heading.</p>
<h3 id="code">Code blocks</h3>
<p>A code block is a span of indented or blank lines
not starting with a bullet list marker or numbered list marker.
It is rendered as preformatted text (a &lt;pre&gt; block in HTML).</p>
<p>Code blocks often contain Go code. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package sort

// Search uses binary search...
//
// As a more whimsical example, this program guesses your number:
//
//  func GuessingGame() {
//      var s string
//      fmt.Printf(&#34;Pick an integer from 0 to 100.\n&#34;)
//      answer := sort.Search(100, func(i int) bool {
//          fmt.Printf(&#34;Is your number &lt;= %d? &#34;, i)
//          fmt.Scanf(&#34;%s&#34;, &amp;s)
//          return s != &#34;&#34; &amp;&amp; s[0] == &#39;y&#39;
//      })
//      fmt.Printf(&#34;Your number is %d.\n&#34;, answer)
//  }
func Search(n int, f func(int) bool) int {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, code blocks also often contain preformatted text besides code. For example:</p>
<pre><code>package path

// Match reports whether name matches the shell pattern.
// The pattern syntax is:
//
//  pattern:
//      { term }
//  term:
//      &#39;*&#39;         matches any sequence of non-/ characters
//      &#39;?&#39;         matches any single non-/ character
//      &#39;[&#39; [ &#39;^&#39; ] { character-range } &#39;]&#39;
//                  character class (must be non-empty)
//      c           matches character c (c != &#39;*&#39;, &#39;?&#39;, &#39;\\&#39;, &#39;[&#39;)
//      &#39;\\&#39; c      matches character c
//
//  character-range:
//      c           matches character c (c != &#39;\\&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;]&#39;)
//      &#39;\\&#39; c      matches character c
//      lo &#39;-&#39; hi   matches character c for lo &lt;= c &lt;= hi
//
// Match requires pattern to match all of name, not just a substring.
// The only possible returned error is [ErrBadPattern], when pattern
// is malformed.
func Match(pattern, name string) (matched bool, err error) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Gofmt indents all lines in a code block by a single tab,
replacing any other indentation the non-blank lines have in common.
Gofmt also inserts a blank line before and after each code block,
distinguishing the code block clearly from the surrounding paragraph text.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes">Common mistakes and pitfalls</h2>
<p>The rule that any span of indented or blank lines
in a doc comment is rendered as a code block
dates to the earliest days of Go.
Unfortunately, the lack of support for doc comments in gofmt
has led to many existing comments that use indentation
without meaning to create a code block.</p>
<p>For example, this unindented list has always been interpreted
by godoc as a three-line paragraph followed by a one-line code block:</p>
<pre><code>package http

// cancelTimerBody is an io.ReadCloser that wraps rc with two features:
// 1) On Read error or close, the stop func is called.
// 2) On Read failure, if reqDidTimeout is true, the error is wrapped and
//    marked as net.Error that hit its timeout.
type cancelTimerBody struct {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This always rendered in <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>cancelTimerBody is an io.ReadCloser that wraps rc with two features:
1) On Read error or close, the stop func is called. 2) On Read failure,
if reqDidTimeout is true, the error is wrapped and

    marked as net.Error that hit its timeout.
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the command in this comment is a one-line paragraph
followed by a one-line code block:</p>
<pre><code>package smtp

// localhostCert is a PEM-encoded TLS cert generated from src/crypto/tls:
//
// go run generate_cert.go --rsa-bits 1024 --host 127.0.0.1,::1,example.com \
//     --ca --start-date &#34;Jan 1 00:00:00 1970&#34; --duration=1000000h
var localhostCert = []byte(`...`)
</code></pre>
<p>This rendered in <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>localhostCert is a PEM-encoded TLS cert generated from src/crypto/tls:

go run generate_cert.go --rsa-bits 1024 --host 127.0.0.1,::1,example.com \

    --ca --start-date &#34;Jan 1 00:00:00 1970&#34; --duration=1000000h
</code></pre>
<p>And this comment is a two-line paragraph (the second line is “{”),
followed by a six-line indented code block and a one-line paragraph (“}”).</p>
<pre><code>// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:
// {
//  &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;MyAPIObject&#34;,
//  &#34;apiVersion&#34;:&#34;v1&#34;,
//  &#34;myPlugin&#34;: {
//      &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;PluginA&#34;,
//      &#34;aOption&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;,
//  },
// }
</code></pre>
<p>And this rendered in <code>go</code> <code>doc</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>On the wire, the JSON will look something like this: {

    &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;MyAPIObject&#34;,
    &#34;apiVersion&#34;:&#34;v1&#34;,
    &#34;myPlugin&#34;: {
        &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;PluginA&#34;,
        &#34;aOption&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;,
    },

}
</code></pre>
<p>Another common mistake was an unindented Go function definition
or block statement, similarly bracketed by “{” and “}”.</p>
<p>The introduction of doc comment reformatting in Go 1.19’s gofmt makes mistakes
like these more visible by adding blank lines around the code blocks.</p>
<p>Analysis in 2022 found that only 3% of doc comments in public Go modules
were reformatted at all by the draft Go 1.19 gofmt.
Limiting ourselves to those comments, about 87% of gofmt’s reformattings
preserved the structure that a person would infer from reading the comment;
about 6% were tripped up by these kinds of unindented lists,
unindented multiline shell commands, and unindented brace-delimited code blocks.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, the Go 1.19 gofmt applies a few heuristics to merge
unindented lines into an adjacent indented list or code block.
With those adjustments, the Go 1.19 gofmt reformats the above examples to:</p>
<pre><code>// cancelTimerBody is an io.ReadCloser that wraps rc with two features:
//  1. On Read error or close, the stop func is called.
//  2. On Read failure, if reqDidTimeout is true, the error is wrapped and
//     marked as net.Error that hit its timeout.

// localhostCert is a PEM-encoded TLS cert generated from src/crypto/tls:
//
//  go run generate_cert.go --rsa-bits 1024 --host 127.0.0.1,::1,example.com \
//      --ca --start-date &#34;Jan 1 00:00:00 1970&#34; --duration=1000000h

// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:
//
//  {
//      &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;MyAPIObject&#34;,
//      &#34;apiVersion&#34;:&#34;v1&#34;,
//      &#34;myPlugin&#34;: {
//          &#34;kind&#34;:&#34;PluginA&#34;,
//          &#34;aOption&#34;:&#34;foo&#34;,
//      },
//  }
</code></pre>
<p>This reformatting makes the meaning clearer as well as making the doc comments
render correctly in earlier versions of Go.
If the heuristic ever makes a bad decision, it can be overridden by inserting
a blank line to clearly separate the paragraph text from non-paragraph text.</p>
<p>Even with these heuristics, other existing comments will need manual
adjustment to correct their rendering.
The most common mistake is indenting a wrapped unindented line of text.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// TODO Revisit this design. It may make sense to walk those nodes
//      only once.

// According to the document:
// &#34;The alignment factor (in bytes) that is used to align the raw data of sections in
//  the image file. The value should be a power of 2 between 512 and 64 K, inclusive.&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>In both of these, the last line is indented, making it a code block.
The fix is to unindent the lines.</p>
<p>Another common mistake is not indenting a wrapped indented line of a list or code block.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Uses of this error model include:
//
//   - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the
// client,
//     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the
// partial
//     errors.
//
//   - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step
// may
//     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
</code></pre>
<p>The fix is to indent the wrapped lines.</p>
<p>Go doc comments do not support nested lists, so gofmt reformats</p>
<pre><code>// Here is a list:
//
//  - Item 1.
//    * Subitem 1.
//    * Subitem 2.
//  - Item 2.
//  - Item 3.
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>// Here is a list:
//
//  - Item 1.
//  - Subitem 1.
//  - Subitem 2.
//  - Item 2.
//  - Item 3.
</code></pre>
<p>Rewriting the text to avoid nested lists usually
improves the documentation and is the best solution.
Another potential workaround is to mix list markers,
since bullet markers do not introduce list items in a numbered list,
nor vice versa.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>// Here is a list:
//
//  1. Item 1.
//
//     - Subitem 1.
//
//     - Subitem 2.
//
//  2. Item 2.
//
//  3. Item 3.
</code></pre>
