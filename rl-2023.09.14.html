So they allowed messages to accumulate and let it drive them crazy, he explains. &#34;You process your email. You have to delete or defer it. God forbid, you have turn it into a task or put it on a calendar. Six years from now, that pile has gotten taller and taller and everybody&#39;s still carrying around that secret shame.&#34;</p><p>But if you you part from the assumption that it is impossible to handle everything ‚Äì and the majority of information thrown at you is not important ‚Äì you can focus on what matters to you.</p><h2>Whatever you do, don&#39;t delete everything</h2><p>If you&#39;re shuddering at the thought of tackling everything you have left over from the last year (or for some of us, the last decade) and want to press the &#34;delete&#34; button immediately ‚Äì don&#39;t do it.</p><p>Instead, narrow down the most important things in all of your inboxes and focus on that.</p><p>It&#39;s hard for people to imagine tackling a mountain of messages, and know what is important and what isn&#39;t important straight away, Mann says. &#34;It would be as for me to say &#39;ah you idiot, you look at your email too much, what is wrong with you?&#39; But some people say &#39;if I take longer than 90 seconds to respond to an email, I might lose my job. In this case, okay, you have to check your email.&#34;</p><p>But if you aren&#39;t in that situation, and find yourself checking your messages constantly ‚Äì you will find it can stop you from doing any other work. Mann recommends checking your email at set times every day: when you first walk into the office, at lunch time and before you leave, for example.</p><h2>Allow yourself time to switch off</h2><p>Take inspiration from a time before emails and mobile phones and switch off periodically. Whatever you do, don&#39;t check your messages ‚Äì not even on Twitter.</p><p>&#34;People don&#39;t vacation like they used to. But we&#39;ve all had that experience at some point, especially in the pre Wi-Fi, pre smartphone days, of literally being incapable of checking their emails,&#34; Mann explains.</p><p>&#34;When you come back, you might say &#39;Oh my god, there&#39;s so much of this&#39;. But then you realise, I didn&#39;t even see this email and somehow the world kept spinning. I&#39;m not saying you should do that every day. But I&#39;m saying remember that feeling.&#34;</p><h2>Don&#39;t be an inbox dick</h2><p>Do unto other people&#39;s inboxes what you would have done to yours. If you hope that people will stop bombarding you with phone calls, messages and emails ‚Äì make sure you aren&#39;t guilty of doing the same.</p><p>Don&#39;t be afraid to confront people who try to bombard you with information that you don&#39;t consider important, Mann says. But before you do, make sure you aren&#39;t guilty of calling someone straight after sending an email, or becoming angry if they don&#39;t respond to your Twitter message straight away.</p><p>&#34;Everybody is overwhelmed. A lot of people are just punting things to the next person and cc&#39;ing and bcc&#39;ing or calling and generating this volume of <em>stuff</em>,&#34; Mann explains. &#34;I think we would all agree it&#39;s insane to act like a Viagra ad or a Bitcoin deposit ad is as important as an email from your boss. But have we really accepted that?&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s the real philosophical jumping-off point that goes for any of these inboxes, he says. &#34;We want to blame the system and the teams and the culture, understandably, for how we got here. But we also have to take responsibility for what we do ourselves.&#34;</p><p>More great stories from WIRED</p><p><strong>üöô SUVs are <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/suv-cars-hybrid-electric-impact?utm_source=More%20Stories&amp;utm_medium=internal">worse for the planet than anyone realised</a></strong></p><p><strong>‚è≤Ô∏è Science says we should <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/winter-work-hours-shorter-circadian-clock?utm_source=More%20Stories&amp;utm_medium=internal">work shorter hours in winter</a></strong></p><p><strong>üêò The illegal trade of <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/mammoth-tusk-hunters-russia-china?utm_source=More%20Stories&amp;utm_medium=internal">Siberian mammoth tusks</a> revealed</strong></p><p><strong>üôà I ditched Google for DuckDuckGo. <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/duckduckgo-google-alternative-search-privacy?utm_source=More%20Stories&amp;utm_medium=internal">Here&#39;s why you should too</a></strong></p><p><strong>üìß How to use psychology to get people to <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/email-reply-psychology?utm_source=More%20Stories&amp;utm_medium=internal">answer your emails</a></strong></p></div></div>

<p><em>This post is part of a short series about my experience in the VP of Engineering role at Honeycomb.</em></p>


<p>In February of 2020, I was promoted from Director of Engineering to Honeycomb‚Äôs first VP of Engineering. Although Charity wrote an extremely generous public <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/honeycomb-welcomes-new-vp-engineering-why-its-so-important-to-look-inside-your-org-before-you-look-outside/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, I hesitated to talk about this new role for quite a while as I was figuring out the job. But since 2020, I‚Äôve noticed how little candid writing there is about paths to the VPE role or what the job is really like.*¬†</p>


<p>I understand why: the stakes for public comment become higher as you move up the ladder, every social media post has the potential to be interpreted as a subtweet or request, and your highest-priority work is often deeply entangled with confidential company and personnel matters.¬†</p>


<p>Nonetheless, I think it‚Äôs useful to share what I can about my experience in the hope that it might encourage others to seriously consider this role, especially those from backgrounds, identities, and genders poorly represented in the VP of Engineering ranks today. VPs of Engineering often have a lot of influence over both company culture and policy, and the decisions our companies make ripple outside of the companies themselves. The whole tech industry would benefit from more perspectives in this role.</p>


<h2 id="h-not-the-plan">Not the plan</h2>


<p>I didn‚Äôt join Honeycomb with the goal of becoming an engineering executive. I joined to be an engineer (employee ~12), with the understanding that I might go back to a management role when there was a need.¬†</p>


<p>I had enough experience at early-stage startups to know that, if the company is successful, you‚Äôll probably do a whole host of things as the company moves through different phases. Being attached to a particular job was more likely to be a hindrance than a help to either my success or the company‚Äôs. I was curious about moving up the engineering management ladder eventually, but I assumed a VP opportunity would be out of reach for a long time, if ever.¬†</p>


<p>Instead, I joined Honeycomb because the team seemed incredibly smart and kind, I thought I would learn a lot, and the product seemed like something I‚Äôd wanted at past jobs but could never find. Happily, all these things turned out to be true and are still true to this day.¬†</p>


<p>If you hope to grow into a specific role sooner rather than later, I suspect joining a startup at a later stage (series B+) might be the most efficient route. Nonetheless, I loved joining Honeycomb at series A, even though it has meant working through some of the wandering-in-the-desert phases of the company. (I‚Äôll save writing about those for my post-IPO Honeycomb screenplay.)</p>


<h2 id="h-the-path">The path</h2>


<p>In the early days of the company, co-founder and then-CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Majors</a> managed basically everyone, from execs to individual engineers. In what was mostly a happy accident, Charity and I turned out to be philosophically aligned on most things management, and I have long admired how her insights <a href="https://charity.wtf/2016/06/30/devops-vs-sre-delayed-coverage-of-the-dumbest-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shape</a> <a href="https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSIPhVjWBO0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conversations</a> in our industry. However, we have fairly different backgrounds and skill sets. While Charity has deep experience in the domains of infrastructure &amp; operations, databases, and backend engineering, I come originally from design, frontend, and product engineering, and I take a particular joy in collaborating with product management and ux design.¬†</p>


<p>We share a lot of experience with metrics and monitoring technologies, although she kind of despises them and I feel a profound affection for them. I‚Äôm also a rules and process person ‚Äî my daily work and even my hobbies often revolve around planning things and managing risk ‚Äî whereas Charity has a more intuitive, spontaneous style, often shines brightest in a crisis, is allergic to checklists, and is quick to spot when things aren‚Äôt working, including when a particular rule or process isn‚Äôt serving us.</p>


<p>As Honeycomb grew and the management workload within R&amp;D increased, I was able to load-balance more and more management work with Charity, usually picking up areas where the work matched my background better than hers. I wish I could call out specific milestones on the path, but the truth is it was done in a thousand small steps. A few title changes along the way were useful backward-looking markers of progress, but they didn‚Äôt often denote major changes in scope beyond (usually) new meetings to attend.</p>


<p>If a startup is growing, there are always new gaps in processes &amp; responsibilities opening up, quickly going from tiny pinpricks in the dam to major leaks of time &amp; attention. There are <em>always</em> new problems to level up on, if you‚Äôre willing to lend a hand with whatever comes up. But to give credit where it‚Äôs due: it‚Äôs natural for startup founders to look for ways to get <em>more</em> out of their team, and yet it doesn‚Äôt seem to be as natural to recognize successes by granting new titles and roles. I have seen both of Honeycomb‚Äôs co-founders support this enthusiastically, both for me and for others at Honeycomb, and it is a rare and lovely thing. If I went looking for another startup to join at some point in the future, I would specifically look for an exec team or founding team that could cite examples of building up high performers for internal promotions ‚Äî and swiftly recognizing and rewarding those already having impact outside of their role-defined scope.</p>


<p>In retrospect, the most interesting transition along the whole journey for me was probably moving from managing only ICs to also managing managers. I‚Äôll write more about this another day, but I would encourage anyone hoping to make this leap to do it at a company where they already know the team, technology, and business problems, rather than moving to a new company to try it out.¬†</p>


<p>While many of the line management skills I already had translated over, it nonetheless took me quite a while to learn how to effectively ‚Äúsee‚Äù the whole organization (and especially where there was friction or where we might need more support) through an additional layer of management. My prior first-hand experience with the people and problems in engineering tided me over until I could work with my managers to build the practices and skills to assess what was happening on my teams effectively.</p>


<p>As Charity mentioned in her blog post, at a slightly rocky point in the company trajectory, we did also explore hiring a VP of Engineering from outside the company. I was grateful that Charity was upfront with me about considering this, and that she invited me into the process of finding and selecting the right person.¬†</p>


<p>We talked to a handful of extraordinary engineering leaders, some who didn‚Äôt feel like quite the right fit for where we were at, and some who decided we weren‚Äôt the right next step in their journey. And then one day we realized we had a fresh new batch of problems to think about, and the old problems that seemed intractable had become‚Ä¶ more tractable. I didn‚Äôt get promoted right then (it wasn‚Äôt the right time) but we also stopped looking for an external hire.¬†</p>


<p>Nonetheless, I think we were all glad we went through this process. Above a certain level, leadership promotions have to be about what the company needs, not the individual, and it was valuable to imagine together what a great VP of Engineering for Honeycomb might look like.</p>


<h2 id="h-how-to-prepare">How to prepare</h2>


<p>While I didn‚Äôt see myself on the path to VP when I joined Honeycomb, in hindsight I can see some traits that helped me become a fit for the role:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Holistic thinking.</strong> My focus naturally tends toward how to make Honeycomb the company more successful, not just my teams. I thrive where I am rewarded for acting in the best interests of the whole company, not my department, team, or self. (This is more often the case at startups than at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/this-org-chart-explains-why-microsofts-ceo-in-waiting-is-suddenly-out-2012-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large companies</a>¬† and part of why I gravitate toward early stage businesses.)</li>


<li><strong>A generalist streak</strong>. I find basically all business problems and domains within a software company interesting, and I have always loved that startups let you see how all the pieces fit together. I also don‚Äôt mind taking on unglamorous work outside of the spotlight when needed.</li>


<li><strong>Happiness at varying levels of abstraction</strong>. I can work at many layers of abstraction and can quickly pick up concepts of a higher-level layer without needing to grok the layers below ‚Äî but I also enjoy getting into the weeds when it makes sense.</li>


<li><strong>An overgrown sense of responsibility</strong>. I have a bad habit of walking into a room with five problems and walking out owning six. This is helpful at a startup where lots of important work falls into gaps between functions. However, it needs to be counterbalanced with a constant effort to wrap up or hand off jobs to others to avoid getting bogged down or stifling the growth of the rest of the team.</li>


<li><strong>A knack for systems thinking, paired with equal interest in both human &amp; technological systems</strong>. I believe this is a super common and normal thing but have had at least one great coach insist that it is not, so I‚Äôm putting it on the list.¬†</li>


<li><strong>A genuine joy in seeing teammates level up</strong>. As a manager, nothing brings me more energy than finding a match between a person ready to take their next step and an important problem at the edge of their abilities that needs to be solved ‚Äî and then building the plan to help them do it.</li>


<li><strong>Good relationships up, down, and sideways</strong>. People all around the company had to be more excited to have me in the job than to roll the dice on an external candidate.¬†</li>
</ul>


<p>These work experiences also helped me out:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Working at other startups of a variety of stages and sizes, especially B2B SaaS startups</strong>. B2C and B2B startups often deal with relatively distinct categories of problems and have each cultivated their own techniques for solving them. It‚Äôs good to see both sides at some point. However, there‚Äôs a lot of value in specializing in either B2B or B2C. The go-to-market motions, org structures, engineering problems, and scaling challenges you‚Äôll see at a B2B company often will differ from what is popular in the B2C world; it‚Äôs useful to know the common patterns for the type of company you‚Äôre at.¬†</li>


<li><strong>Working across the stack</strong>. While my engineering experience is deepest in frontend technologies, I am very grateful to have built early experience in a number of shops that did pair programming and brought a DevOps mindset to their work. I was able to learn from great backend, infrastructure, platform, and ops engineers and get a sense for both how they thought and what problems were important to them. (It delights me that two of the engineers who taught me the most, Eric Saxby and Blake Irvin, are now regular Honeycomb users who I bump into sometimes in our community Slack.) While you don‚Äôt need to be an expert in every area of engineering to be an engineering executive, a little empathy and high-level domain understanding across all your teams goes a long way.</li>


<li><strong>Having experience in the dev tools and monitoring space; being a tools nerd</strong>. I‚Äôve worked for three dev tools companies in a row, and I have a hard time imagining doing something else. I genuinely love the Honeycomb product and feel great affection for many other products in the observability, monitoring, and dev tools space. My knowledge of our domain and enthusiasm for these tools can be useful to my colleagues and be a source of energy when we otherwise might get discouraged.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="h-an-element-of-luck-and-a-great-team">An element of luck and a great team</h2>


<p>Despite the long preceding section about how to prepare for this role, there was a lot of luck involved in being the right person for this role at the right time.</p>


<p>I‚Äôve talked about how Charity‚Äôs complementary skills and experience were part of what made me a fit for this role, but that‚Äôs not the whole picture. I was also able to take on the job because we had a deeply experienced team of early senior ICs who had key engineering challenges more than handled, especially Ben Hartshorne and Ian Wilkes.¬†</p>


<p>VPs of Engineering from frontend backgrounds are relatively rare, and it‚Äôs partly because the most pressing technical challenges a startup faces are often around scaling, reliability, and backend architecture. If we had been dealing with nonstop incidents, constant struggles with scaling, and major architectural challenges with our query and storage engine, someone with deeper backend and operational experience likely would have been chosen for the job, not me.¬†</p>


<p>Because of Ben, Ian, and other incredibly talented ICs on our team, and some of the solid design decisions the founding team made that bought us a lot of technical runway, these concerns were not top of mind for our leaders. Goals like executing well against our product strategy and leveling up our user experience were instead the concerns of the day, and there I could be more helpful.¬†</p>


<p>Our executive team also already had some accomplished, seasoned external hires within our go¬† to market functions. Even the execs you might describe as company-grown leaders (Christine and Charity) already had founder or leadership experience from prior companies, and Charity was well-known as a talented manager long before starting Honeycomb. If the exec team had tilted more heavily toward new execs or those promoted from within, there might not have been space to grow one more exec into their role, which takes both months of runway and patience from other leaders on the team. I‚Äôm very lucky to have had such a strong crew of exec peers who generously shared their wisdom with me as I stepped into the role and extended some grace as I figured it out.</p>


<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>The most important thing I learned in hindsight is that the right VP of Engineering for a company is <em>contextual</em>. Before Honeycomb, I would have thought I could list off a set of canonical traits that make a great VP of Engineering. Sure, some roles might call for a larger helping of one strength or another, but I thought the basic template would be unchanged from company to company. This is much less true than I first thought.</p>


<p>Generally, the same basic things need to get done in most software companies, but the shape of the executive needed to guide those things can change dramatically depending on the current set of problems for the organization and who is already there, whether exec, manager, or IC. And once you‚Äôre in the job, the requirements also don‚Äôt stay static, especially in a growing company. The role may morph and shift over time just as other startup roles do.</p>

For me, learning and leveraging the right monorepo tooling is way easier than having to enforce consistency across large numbers of repos with a small team or watch a low-tooling monolith decay into tightly-coupled spaghetti. I am also in a particular situation where the need for eventual scale is obvious, will come very quickly (clients are big), and the thought of having to rush a scale-inexperienced team (management and devs!) through a monolith-to-microservice migration on a tightly coupled codebase while meeting SLAs is so unpleasant that it makes me a bit sick to my stomach to think about it.</p><p>- The monorepo framework/tooling matters a lot. For instance, NX is small-scale friendly and largely can be overseen by senior Typescript devs. Bazel, on the other hand, requires a hefty context switch and has a very steep learning curve.</p><p>- You are right that releasing all services together does not scale past a certain point. My point is that microservice monorepos let you pivot quickly between all-together (monolithic) releases and individual app releases as appropriate for your scale. With good caching and parallel blue/green deployments, adding new services to an all-at-once build/deploy pipeline just uses a bit more compute for the pipeline without meaningfully impacting the pipeline run times.</p><p>- Having to release services serially in a certain order obviously indicates something is seriously wrong under the hood.</p><p>- You are very right about monorepo tooling/best practices, but I would extend that to any project that eventually will need to scale. Someone has to take ownership and enforce good practices. Spaghetti code can be harder to prevent in a feature-heavy monolith and certainly is harder to deal with for me if it is in many different repos (i.e., several monoliths).</p><p>- You can have more than one monorepo for teams that are very different or have specific needs (i.e., different languages, mobile apps, etc.).</p><p>- I wish I were in a situation where my team could commit to avoiding breaking API changes, but it just is not so because of aggressive development timelines. (I am sure this will change in the future as we scale.) All-together versioning/releasing helps deal with (planned, intentional) breaking API changes very efficiently, because (as long as you can tolerate a failed API call once in a while as a blue/green deployment switches traffic) you&#39;re basically performing the deployment as if it is a monolith.</p><p>Add: 1000% agree about db access. That is very easy to enforce at the architecture/team level.

So yes they can be right-sized in your cloud easier and have tailored performance, but it comes at the complexity of the deployment and management of the system. By comparison monoliths can sometimes be managed without a dedicated SRE/DevOps/CloudEngineering team.</p><p>Monoliths tend to be cheaper to deploy (up to a certain point).</p><p>Startups should consider building on monoliths more often. For proof of concept and MVP tools, monoliths are the way to go. Solo developers also are much better served with monoliths compared to micro services. But I will say, eventually if you scale big enough it will eventually make sense to leave monoliths behind and move towards micro services. Yes there are exceptions (someone will write, &#34;but XYZ company is worth 9 gajillion dollars and runs on a monolith), but generally speaking I consider starting with a monolith and moving to micro services after you hit market acceptance for your product.

We&#39;re talking about order of magnitude difference in complexity of adding new features.</p><p>In typescript world, monorepo with shared packages where some are dockerized services (all under same monorepo wide version) is more than enough for most projects. Microservice crowd will call it monolith (because services can&#39;t be deployed independently, they likely share SQL database etc), but it&#39;s a set of services. You can run it from docker/swarm/k8s - scalability is not really a problem here until you&#39;re HUGE (hundreds of developers or hundreds of machines to deploy to).

It is a 20+ years old micro-services architecture. More than 50 services all interacting with each other in mysterious time dependent ways. It is almost impossible to debug or reason about. It took him most of a year to figure out how to reliably and automatically build and boot the system from scratch.<p>I have worked on systems with the same functionality but architectured as a single monolith + database. Maintaining that system was a walk in the park comparatively.

Inevitably the next time you had business requirements on that repo, something in CI/CD or environment had changed enough that you had to do a bunch of devops/infra/non-business work to get the plumbing working again to even start the task.</p><p>Even in teams where we eventually had nice central utilities &amp; libraries with versioned dependencies, you never had the chance to do enough &#34;catch up&#34; releases to keep all 100 repos on some reasonably recent version of the core libraries.  So the cost to activate some new observability function from your central libs was huge because you needed to make small changes on 50+ repos otherwise the observability was pointless since it had low coverage.

The monolith is still alive and kicking in a much reduced state but the reason we cannot decom it has nothing to do with design or time or priorities - the monolith is sitting in a data centre and is the only regulatory permitted way (in our case) to access the mainframe.

I suggested starting with monolith. Guess whose design was accepted because it was more sexy. It never got to production for multiple reasons, but part of it was that development was awfully slow.

The opposite also applies - you can upgrade 9 out of 10 components to JDK 11 even when one cannot be upgraded, instead of that one module holding everything else back in some monolithic system.</p><p>That said, there are lots of complexities to microservices and it&#39;s easy to mess things up - I&#39;ve seen projects where I&#39;m the first person that figures out that some shared code should actually be a Maven/pip/npm package in Nexus/Artifactory instead of just copying and pasting code across codebases, because nobody has put in the work to set everything up properly before me. Don&#39;t even get me started on day 2 concerns like tracing and debugging, which the article touches upon.</p><p>Other times, even modular monoliths might run into issues because people aren&#39;t good enough with writing decoupled code without too many common dependencies (unless forced by the language and its mechanisms to have proper separation), or aren&#39;t up to par with utilizing feature flags and such properly.</p><p>I think that at the end of the day, all code rots and eventually is hard to work with, which also affects entire frameworks or even languages: <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/brown-green-language/" rel="nofollow">https://earthly.dev/blog/brown-green-language/</a></p><p>Your architecture will sometimes have concrete technical benefits or characteristics to take into account, but a lot of the time most of the actual effects will be organizational - how you will or won&#39;t be able to build everything, who will be responsible for what and what risks any particular deployment or version bump will carry.
