<p>Ready to switch from your Apple Watch Series 7 to the new Series 8, Ultra, or SE? Or maybe you just need to transfer your existing Apple Watch with your new iPhone? Follow along for how to seamlessly pair a new or existing Apple Watch with iPhone without losing data – including a new process in iOS 16.</p>



<p>Apple Watch backups happen automatically and are saved on the iPhone your Apple Watch is paired with. However, there’s no place in Settings to manually back up your <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">Apple Watch</a> or see when the last automatic backup was.</p>



<p>Read on for how to make sure your Apple Watch is backed up and you’re all set to upgrade to your new one.</p>



<p>If you’re upgrading to a new iPhone 14 (or any other new model), you’ll need to take care of that first.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/23/upgrade-new-iphone-without-losing-data/"></a><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/16/transfer-data-to-iphone-14/">How to upgrade to your iPhone 14 without losing data</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Apple notes that these items are not included with Apple Watch backups: Bluetooth pairings, credit or debit cards used for Apple Pay, Apple Watch passcode, and Messages.</p>

<h3>New with iOS 16 – automatic transfer for existing Apple Watch</h3>



<p>A fresh and seamless new process should show up with iOS 16 to move an existing Apple Watch from your old iPhone to your new one.</p>



<ol>
<li>Make sure to set up your new iPhone and restore with a backup or complete the Quick Transfer option from your old iPhone</li>



<li>After setting up your new iPhone, make sure your Apple Watch is on your wrist (and passcode entered)</li>



<li>Look for a message on your watch to <strong><em>Pair Watch with new iPhone?</em></strong></li>



<li>Choose <strong><em>OK</em></strong></li>



<li>You can leave your watch on your wrist as the transfer happens – even workouts/Ring progress from earlier in the day remains after transfer</li>
</ol>



<p>If this process doesn’t show up for you, follow the steps below…</p>

<h3> Use an Apple Watch backup to pair a new or existing watch</h3>



<ol>
<li>If you’re upgrading to a new iPhone, make sure to set that up first (restore from fresh backup)</li>



<li><strong><em>Open the Watch app</em></strong> on your new iPhone to start the pairing process (you can choose to add your new Apple Watch before removing your existing one too: All Watches &gt; Add Watch if the auto pair screen doesn’t pop up)</li>



<li><strong><em>Power on your Apple Watch</em></strong> and look for the <strong><em>pairing sphere code</em></strong>, follow the prompts</li>



<li>When asked, choose to restore your new Apple Watch from a backup and choose the most recent one</li>



<li>If you’re not seeing a backup available from your most recent iPhone backup, follow along below for how to force an Apple Watch backup</li>
</ol>



<h3>Pair new Apple Watch with new iPhone</h3>



<p>If you need or want to pair a new Apple Watch with your iPhone or pair an existing watch as a new one:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the <strong><em>Watch app on your iPhone</em></strong></li>



<li><strong><em>Tap All Watches</em></strong> in the top left corner</li>



<li>Choose <strong><em>Add Watch</em></strong></li>



<li>Follow the prompts </li>



<li>You should see an option to restore the backup from your previous watch to your new watch</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-force-an-apple-watch-backup">Force an Apple Watch backup</h3>



<p>If you’re not seeing an available backup to restore, you might need to force a backup.</p>



<p>Since Apple Watch backups don’t happen with every iCloud or Mac/PC backup with your iPhone, this is how <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204518">Apple says</a> to do force them:</p>



<ol>
<li>Keep your paired Apple Watch and old iPhone close together</li>



<li>Open the <strong><em>Watch app on your iPhone</em></strong></li>



<li>Tap <strong><em>All Watches</em></strong> at the top, pick your watch, then tap the “i” on the right side</li>



<li>Tap <em><strong>Unpair Apple Watch </strong></em>(during the unpairing process your Apple Watch will do a fresh backup to your iPhone)</li>



<li>Follow the prompts to unpair your current Watch</li>



<li>Make a fresh backup of your old iPhone, restore that backup to your new iPhone</li>



<li>Open the Watch app on your new iPhone to start the pairing process of your new Watch</li>



<li>Power on your new Apple Watch and look for the pairing sphere code, follow the prompts</li>



<li>When asked, choose to restore your new Apple Watch from a backup and choose the most recent one</li>
</ol>

Between my day to day at VMware, and the Kubernetes/CNCF communities I probably spend &gt;50% of my time on Zoom.</p><p id="9314">There are two big things that have really bugged me about my interaction with zoom.</p><ul><li id="9281">It is too hard to find the mute/unmute button — especially when the zoom app doesn’t have focus.</li><li id="0845">When you say goodby to someone there is an awkwardness as you both much around trying to find the “Leave Meeting” button.</li></ul><p id="4ba2">(There is an option to enable keyboard shortcuts when zoom doesn’t have focus but that does it for <em>all</em> the shortcuts. I’m too afraid of conflicts with other apps. A lot of folks have also suggested some system level or hardware mute. That would work but I <em>really</em> want the “mute” icon next to my face. There is a subtle etiquette to video conferencing and that is part of it.)</p><p id="b28d">I started by asking Twitter. Based on suggestions there, my solution has evolved over the last couple of days and I’m pretty happy with the direction it is going.</p><figure></figure><p id="d2f2">The first utility that solved a critical problem was <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Keyboard Maestro</a>. This is a staple utility for the Mac that has been around in one version or another. It does way more than I need and I’m not sure I want it so I turned off things like the custom paste and switcher stuff as I didn’t need that.</p><p id="ac95">Keyboard Maestro lets me capture global shortcut keys and send commands to Zoom without having to change the foreground application. Beyond this, you can set things up for keys that aren’t actually on your keyboard. I’m using F19 along with a bunch of modifier keys.</p><p id="da40">You can download my <a href="https://gist.github.com/jbeda/e0f8888f7adf870aa46f5f877c286326" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">macros here</a>.</p><figure></figure><p id="163f">Other options considered: AppleScript looks cool but the zoom client doesn’t have any bindings and I’m not sure you can send commands without changing focus. <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Hammerspoon</a> also looks really interesting and I haven’t had time to figure out if it would work for me or not.</p><figure><figcaption>WhiteFox Keyboard. I reprogrammed the right Alt key.</figcaption></figure><p id="cb89">Before I ordered any hardware, I wanted to try with stuff I already had. I have a <a href="https://kono.store/products/whitefox-mechanical-keyboard" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">WhiteFox mechanical keyboard</a> that has open firmware that is fully reprogrammable. I was able to assign a high function key to an extra key there and use that as “Push To Talk”. That was very cool. Depending on your keyboard you may be able to do something similar and have a dedicated zoom PTT key.</p><figure></figure><p id="d469">I was confident enough at this point to order some hardware. I started with a pedal. There are a lot of options out there and many of them are focused on transcriptionists. I decided to splurge a bit and got a high end pedal — the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/savant-elite2-dual-pedal/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Kinesis Savant Elite2</a>. It seems like some really solid hardware.</p><p id="43f7">Programming this pedal is interesting. You flip it into “programming mode” and it then mounts as a USB drive. You can use their utility or, even better, just edit a text file on that drive. Note that I had to <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/savant-elite2/#firmware-updates" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">upgrade the firmware</a> on the pedal to have it be able to address F19. But after that things we easy.</p><p id="0891">I set it up with the left pedal as “push to talk” (F19) and the right pedal as “toggle mute” (shift-F19).</p><pre><span id="4cdd">[lpedal]&gt;[f19]<br/>{rpedal}&gt;{-shift}{f19}{+shift}</span></pre><p id="9dc5">While searching for the right pedal I ran across the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">elgato Stream Deck</a>. This thing is awesome. It is a programmable keypad with LEDs in each key. The 15 button version ran me ~$150.</p><figure><figcaption>The colors look a little strange here. It looks better in real life.</figcaption></figure><p id="d6cb">While primarily aimed at streamers (with builtin in actions for twitch and OBS) it is more general purpose than that. I was able to program it to hit all the various flavors of F19 that I needed and created custom images for each key. I also was able to put a world clock on there, volume controls, and OBS scene buttons for when I’m doing <a href="https://tgik.io" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">TGIK</a>.</p><p id="a399">I ginned up some icons quickly in Illustrator and exported them as 72px x 72px PNGs. If you want them let me know and I’ll post them someplace. For reference the Zoom icons are: hang up, push to talk, toggle mute, toggle camera, bring Zoom into focus.</p><p id="b6b6">The one downside: the state of mute/unmute isn’t reflected on the button. That’d be cool.</p><p id="3c66">I’m probably done for now. I’ll probably tweak a bit but no major changes. I wish that the Zoom Mac app had better interfaces or an SDK as that would make integration easier. But oh well. It does look like the <a href="https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/overview/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Stream Deck does have an SDK</a> and that would be fun to play with.</p><p id="7a3f">Thanks for everyone that had suggestions and pointers through this project!</p></div></div>

	<p>&#34;I am not even sure we can call it a watch.&#34;</p>

<p>Ben Clymer wrote those words about the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hodinkee-apple-watch-review" target="_blank">a little over eight years ago</a> when the very first generation of the category-leading smartwatch was revealed. A lot has changed for Apple Watch since then, but the initial ambiguity is just as relevant as ever. People are, somehow, still fighting about this. </p>

	<p>The Apple Watch Series 8 goes on sale today, and I&#39;ve spent the past week testing it out. Series 8 is, in many ways, an iterative release for the flagship smartwatch, and its debut was largely overshadowed by the announcement of the heavy-duty Apple Watch Ultra (review coming soon). The Ultra is a big deal for Apple, but the Series 8 will be the most versatile option for most people.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="5">
	<p>In many ways, Apple Watch Series 8 is identical to last year&#39;s Series 7. It comes in either 45mm or 41mm, with either a stainless steel or aluminum case, and all options feature the always-on display that was first added with Apple Watch Series 5. </p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="6">
	<p>So let&#39;s focus on what&#39;s new. There are three updates to the Apple Watch Series 8 that strike at three of the smartwatch&#39;s core abilities: safety, health and wellness, and battery life.</p>

	<p>The headlining safety feature is an algorithm that detects car crashes and will contact emergency services for you if you are unconscious or trapped and unable to dismiss the initial warning notification. I was in a pretty nasty wreck at the start of 2021, and it&#39;s not something I&#39;d like to experience again, so I&#39;m happy to report that I was not able to test this feature out. But I think we can all agree it&#39;s more useful than a moonphase complication, however charming those may be. </p>

	<p>The car crash detection mode is enabled by the addition of a new motion sensor that includes an accelerometer. The accelerometer can detect up to 256 Gs and has a sampling rate that is four times faster than the one found in previous Apple Watch generations. Apple tested the watch in professional crash test labs (just like you see in car commercials), placing the watch on the wrist of the crash test dummies (better them than me!). </p>

	<p>In addition to the updated accelerometer, other existing Apple Watch sensors have been optimized to help in crash detection. The barometer can detect cabin pressure changes such as when an airbag is deployed, the microphone is able to detect sudden increases in decibel level such as screeching tires and crunching metal, and the GPS is able to detect sudden deceleration or changes in direction.</p>

	The All-New Body Temperature Sensor Prioritizes Wellness And Privacy
</p>

        </div>
        <div data-index="14">
	<p>The addition of a temperature sensor has been one of the peskiest and longest-running rumors surrounding each successive addition of the Apple Watch. And with Series 8, we finally have it. </p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="15">
	<p>There are actually two temperature sensors placed within the watch: one on the caseback underneath the back crystal and another underneath the front-facing dial. As of right now, the  sensors are fairly narrow in scope. As currently constructed, the sensors won&#39;t flag when you have a fever; instead they&#39;re optimized for tracking women&#39;s health. They&#39;re able to provide an estimate of a completed menstrual cycle for a woman, when combined with Apple Watch&#39;s heart-rate tracking capability. The sensors also track nightly shifts in wrist temperature when a wearer is sleeping, and will send a notification surrounding any abnormal nighttime temperatures.</p>

	<p>My perspective is fairly limited here, but overall, I think this is a great addition to Apple Watch&#39;s health and wellness abilities, and I particularly appreciate Apple&#39;s continued emphasis on privacy. My understanding is that Apple Watch Series 8 is the only wearable device with cycle tracking to offer end-to-end encryption via Apple&#39;s Health app. That means only the end user has access to their personal compiled health data; Apple is unable to view or share anything.</p>

	Low Power Mode Has Been A Long Time Coming
</p>

        </div>
        <div data-index="20">
	<p>Apart from disposability, the most common source of criticism for any smartwatch or wearable device is the low power reserve. A smartwatch has to return to the power cord and wall socket night after night to receive a renewed lease on life, all while our mechanical and quartz watches continue to tick. That doesn&#39;t necessarily change on Apple Watch Series 8, but Apple is introducing a new Low Power Mode that helps things a bit more.</p>

	<p>Apple Watch Series 8 has a standard &#34;all-day&#34; battery life of 18 hours, where you can text, take calls, and run GPS to your heart&#39;s content. But when you engage the new Low Power Mode ability, Apple Watch Series 8 has an increased lifespan of 36 hours. The bad news is that when Low Power Mode is kicked on, you do end up losing the always-on display and background health monitoring, but you&#39;ll be able to keep track of the time or make any potential emergency phone calls for a much longer period.</p>

      <p>The new Metropolitan watch face is inspired by classic Art Deco watch dials and can be quickly adjusted to feature three different numeral variants.</p>

	<p>Low Power Mode is definitely a helpful development that we&#39;ve been waiting on for quite some time, but I don&#39;t think it will be a game-changer for the Apple Watch in the way something like solar-charging would be. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Low Power Mode is a welcome start in keeping the Apple Watch on people&#39;s wrists and off the charger, but I don&#39;t think Switzerland has to worry about people throwing away their mechanical watches just yet.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="25">
	<p>It is worth mentioning that the charging time for an Apple Watch is remarkably quick; if you&#39;re using an Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter, it will take approximately 45 minutes to hit 80 percent and around 75 minutes to reach full charge on Apple Watch Series 8.</p>

	WatchOS 9 Is The Real Headline Attraction
</p>

        </div>
        <div data-index="27">
	<p>The new Low Power Mode isn&#39;t exclusive to Apple Watch Series 8. It&#39;s available as part of watchOS 9, a free software update for Apple Watch that will be available on all mainline Apple Watch models starting with Series 4.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="28">
	<p>WatchOS 9 includes other cool attributes, including the updated Compass app with &#34;Backtrack&#34; capability that allows you to drop waypoints while hiking. The upgraded compass app was primarily teased as part of Apple Watch Ultra, but many of its new features will be available on Apple Watch Series 8 and older Apple Watch models, via the watchOS 9 update. </p>

	<p>I played around with the new Compass app while walking around Lower Manhattan near the HODINKEE office and really enjoyed the updated user experience and navigation. I&#39;m excited to take it out into the woods in the near future to give it a spin in an area that isn&#39;t defined by a street grid.</p>

    
</div>
        
        <div data-index="32">
	<p>Over the last eight years, Apple Watch has changed the narrative surrounding what a watch can be. I think it&#39;s hard to argue that it hasn&#39;t had a comprehensive impact on how humanity views what is on their wrist; because of Apple Watch, more people than ever before are using a so-called &#34;watch&#34; as a tool for work and for pleasure, for travel and for communication. </p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="33">
	<p>So, to return to Ben&#39;s initial hesitancy in 2014: Is the Apple Watch a watch? At this point, I think there&#39;s only one answer: It&#39;s a watch if that&#39;s what you want it to be, but it can also be so much more.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="34">
	<p>The Apple Watch Series 8 is officially available today. As is custom, it&#39;s available in two price points, with GPS-equipped models starting at $399 and the GPS+Cellular models available for $499 and above. The Apple Watch Series 8 is focused primarily on small improvements, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &#34;must&#34; upgrade if you&#39;re already an Apple Watch owner. But if you&#39;re in the market to upgrade or are a first-time buyer, it&#39;s still the best smartwatch for daily living that money can buy.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="35">
	<p>The more affordable Apple Watch SE also comes to retailers today, starting at $249. The brand-new Apple Watch Ultra will land at retailers next week. We&#39;ll have more details in a Hands-On report about that model soon.</p>
