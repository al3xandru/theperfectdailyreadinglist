The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum’s friend’s house, into which she had disappeared. “Won’t be long,” she’d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it.</span></p><p>Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag – minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam.</p><p>I was in trouble, of course – but I was not convinced that I’d done anything wrong. Instead it was as though, in putting an end to that desperate boredom, I had narrowly escaped falling off some kind of precipice – and I knew I would do whatever it took to avoid going over the edge in future.</p><p>I did not understand then – two decades before my first conference call or doctor’s waiting room – that boredom was a fact of life no more avoidable than any other mental state, good or bad. At times, it may even be a dominant experience. Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline, hitting the floor in one’s 50s. But though boredom may be less prominent in middle life, it is still present – evidence suggests it comes creeping back in your 60s, especially among women.</p><figure id="7a661708-9f78-4e86-a0aa-7070805d6181" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="illustration of a man lying on his back, one leg bent, a pensive finger at his chin" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/master/3782.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.0941300898995" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline again.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>It is a familiar feeling and very common. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a “boom time for boredom”. Most of us are poorly equipped to cope with being shut in our homes indefinitely, even with the internet to distract us.</p><p>But we should not fear being bored, say psychologists James Danckert and John D Eastwood, the authors of <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/out-of-my-skull-9780674984677.html" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom</a></em>. Their research has revealed boredom to be widely misunderstood, perhaps even unfairly maligned. Boredom evolved to help us, says Danckert. It signals that we are unengaged, in need of an activity to satisfy us. “I think that’s a good thing, in a lot of ways. How we respond to it is up to us. I think you can minimise it. But do you want to totally eliminate it? I don’t think you do.”</p><p>Danckert and Eastwood contend that boredom can steer us towards realising our potential and living full, meaningful lives. They say it communicates an important message that – in trying to outrun it my entire life – I had been refusing to heed.</p><p>What if I stopped and listened?</p><p><em><strong>Danckert is an Australian</strong></em> cognitive neuroscientist now based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He began studying boredom 15 years ago, a case of “physician, heal thyself,” he says. “As a kid, and still into my adult years, I experience boredom, and whenever I do, I hate it. I find it a very frustrating, agitating experience.”</p><p>This isn’t a new phenomenon. To quote from <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/26/boredom-lively-history-toohey-review" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Boredom: A Lively History</a></em>, by the classicist Peter Toohey, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote in disgust: “How long the same things? Surely I will yawn, I will sleep, I will eat, I will be thirsty, I will be cold, I will be hot. Is there no end?” In the Middle Ages monks complained of “the noonday demon”: the personification of acedia – torpor, alongside agitation – provoked by the constraints and repetition of their daily lives. And though one could already be “a bore”, it was Dickens who was the first to term it “boredom” – in <em>Bleak House</em> in 1852. Lady Dedlock complains of being “bored to death” of herself, more than a century before Bruce Springsteen would express the same restless dissatisfaction in Dancing in the Dark. His characterisation of boredom as a frustrated hunger (“I’m just about starving tonight”) evokes Tolstoy’s definition in <em>Anna Karenina</em> of the feeling as “the desire for desires”.</p><figure id="080ad77d-5fe0-4526-9714-5b1f635b58a7" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Couple sitting on a sofa both engaged on their phones" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/master/5348.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.0998504113687" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Boredom is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>“Boredom is such a fascinating topic, with tentacles that spread into philosophy, anthropology, literature, religion, theology,” says Eastwood, who is head of the <a href="http://boredomlab.org/" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Boredom Lab </a>at York University in Toronto. There researchers study boredom from social, clinical and cognitive perspectives – from shoring up the link with creativity and improving outcomes in education, to better understanding the subjective experience of mental exertion and attention – with a view to applying their findings in the real world. “But as a scientist, I wasn’t convinced that everybody was using the term in the same way.”</p><p>Eastwood became interested in boredom 20 years ago, after observing a seeming “crisis of agency” among young men he saw in his private psychotherapy practice. They were disengaged, under-achieving, perhaps abusing marijuana or struggling with depression, he says. Eastwood characterises their circumstance as a “failure to launch into life”, which these men told him they experienced as “being chronically bored”. But what was being bored, exactly? “I thought: what is this?”</p><p>In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, he and Danckert define boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of “wanting to do something, but not wanting to do anything”. It is not an emotion, as such, but an ongoing cognitive process where we wish to engage our minds, but nothing seems to satisfy. It is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.</p><p>It is this particular combination of lethargy and restlessness that distinguishes boredom from frustration (where a specific desire has been thwarted) and apathy (where there is no desire at all). And though boredom seems to be a risk factor for depression, it is not the same. To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity. “Only boring people get bored,” goes the aphorism. “I’m highly motivated to prove it’s not true,” jokes Danckert.</p><p>It is when we fail to act on the signal, or succumb to distractions, that the feeling of boredom becomes protracted and causes us misery. As the Booker prize winner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-enright" title="" data-link-name="in body link">Anne Enright</a> wrote recently: “Boredom is a productive state, so long as you don’t let it go sour on you.” It is striking that the predisposition to it is negatively perceived in a way that other personality traits aren’t. Complaints of “I’m bored” are often seen as uniquely provoking, Eastwood notes. “There is this impulse in us to say, ‘There’s something wrong with you, you should not be bored.’ But to simply judge them, I think, misses the point. They know there’s things to do – but they can’t bring their desires in the moment in line with what’s there.”</p><figure id="09474701-a71b-43de-a17e-ed419fc85f35" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Illustration of a girl sitting on the ground looking bored" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.10604706583257" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Some people are better equipped to cope than others. In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, the psychologists compare two astronauts who responded very differently to the constraints and monotony of space exploration. Russia’s Valentin Lebedev, who spent 211 days in space in the early 1980s, failed to be satisfied by the busy work dictated by ground control and, after five months, did not “even want to look out of a porthole”. As commander of the International Space Station in 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield found purpose even in plumbing repairs. The psychologists suggest it was Hadfield’s intrinsic motivation to find meaning in what he was doing, and to occupy and challenge himself within the confines of his environment, that set the two astronauts apart. Hadfield claims to never be bored – but, Danckert says, it’s more that “he just deals with it really very well”.</p><p><em><strong>In the years after</strong></em> I tore apart Mum’s car, I got better at not being bored, even in testing conditions. My parents are enthusiastic sailors and most of my school holidays were spent in the close confines of their yacht, without television or internet, during sometimes long passages at sea.</p><p>On those trips I read every book on board, regardless of interest (a dictionary; a medical encyclopaedia) or age appropriateness (pulpy Dick Francis thrillers, replete with rumpy-pumpy); and when I ran out of other people’s stories, I wrote my own. I spent long periods listening to the same music. At a push, I could be alone with my thoughts, observing them with slight indifference, as though they were a TV show that had not yet hooked me.</p><p>I considered this evidence of my extreme aversion to boredom. In fact, according to Danckert and Eastwood, I may just have developed a good response to it. Though it has not been substantiated by research, they suggest that boredom has been the push for much creativity, innovation and growth – while simultaneously a source of distress for many.</p><p>The mistake many people make is seeking to escape the uncomfortable feeling, instead of interrogating what it is trying to tell them, says Eastwood. They may distract themselves with social media, or worse: boredom has also been shown to be a factor in unhealthy eating, as well as use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.</p><figure id="26762589-5759-4596-aecc-39d216042f86" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Illustration of a man twiddling his thumbs" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/master/2031.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="727.6440177252585" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Boredom is a call to action, but many of us choose not to hear it.’</span> Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>In relying on external solutions, we undermine our sense of ourselves as the authors of our own lives, and the problem may become chronic. In young people, boredom is associated with higher than average risk-taking; in the elderly, it can speed up the degenerative process of ageing. Both groups are at particular risk of depression, for which boredom is a precursor.</p><p>Boredom-prone people also experience higher levels of anger, aggression and hostility and may be driven to look for meaning in extreme political views, or tribalism. To Danckert, that means boredom may be one part of our ever more polarised politics and public discourse. “When you’re in the midst of an overload of information, one response is to shout louder,” he says. Sociologist Orrin Klapp, writing in 1986, called it “ego-screaming” and that “perfectly captures Twitter trolling,” says Danckert.</p><p>The fact that our response to boredom is often destructive, adversarial or otherwise problematic speaks to just how deeply uncomfortable we find the sensation. A 2014 study found that many people chose to administer painful electric shocks to themselves rather than being left alone with their thoughts. One man shocked himself 190 times in 15 minutes.</p><p>“All too often when we’re bored, we see ourselves as passive, empty vessels to fill – we look for stimuli that will get rid of the bad feeling in the short term,” says Eastwood. “But it doesn’t foster and grow our capacity for agency – and that’s exactly what we need to be free from boredom and its negative consequences.”</p><p><em><strong>Danckert and Eastwood</strong></em> are reluctant to blame the present problem on our preoccupation with technology alone. But it is true that tech presents us with a powerful distraction. If the goal is to simply avoid being bored, it may be easier now than ever, what with the infinite scroll of social media, endless hours of entertainment on Netflix and Spotify, and all our friends always available.</p><p>But this over-abundance of things to do itself can exacerbate boredom. Eastwood evokes the “paradox of choice”, saying “options are not necessarily freeing and do not necessarily make us happy”. Seeking relief on the internet “can feel like trying to drink from a fire hose” Danckert and Eastwood write. Not only that, in hijacking our attention, technology may, over time, compound the issue it seems to alleviate. “It takes time and attention to scroll through Instagram or play Candy Crush, but at the end of it, you’re not satisfied, because you didn’t do the harder work of figuring out: ‘What do I really want to do?’ It’s a vicious cycle: you got some engagement, but it wasn’t the thing you needed,” says Danckert. That is the challenge that boredom lays down, he says: “to figure out what is going to be meaningful and useful to you in your life”.</p><p>Becoming better attuned to our own inner states can allay the discomfort and illuminate a satisfying course of action. Mindfulness, which fosters a non-judgmental response to one’s thoughts (as I now know I practised on my parents’ boat), has been linked to lower levels of boredom. Danckert lets his mind wander on his three-mile walk to work , thinking of “the dumbest things – but it is engaging to just follow those threads and see where they lead you”.</p><p>Eastwood’s own ritual is making time to sit and think, with a cup of tea – a period of “constructive internal reflection”, during which he connects with his internal compass. Uncomfortable feelings steer us for the better, he says. “Just as it’s good that we have the capacity for pain, to keep us safe, it’s good that we have the capacity for boredom, because it saves us from the ruin of stagnation. It keeps us moving forward and searching for a better way of applying ourselves, for engaging in the world.”</p><p>Received in that spirit, boredom can be a call to action – but many of us choose not to hear it. Wincing, I admit to Danckert that I have opened Twitter, scrolled for a while, become bored with scrolling, closed Twitter, then immediately opened Twitter again, almost instinctively. I do this embarrassingly often, I tell him – it’s just easier to push through boredom on the internet, rather than taking it as a cue to log off.</p><p>Danckert reiterates, not without sympathy, I think, that at moments like that it is better to “just do something”. It does not necessarily have to align with some higher purpose in life – simply putting down my phone will break the cycle of unsatisfying engagement, and reinforce my own sense of my autonomy.</p><p>Within weeks of our interview, a global pandemic takes hold, and I count myself lucky to just be bored. Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over. I spend less time on my phone. I read my flatmate’s books that have rested on our communal shelf for years without ever piquing my curiosity. I bake, for the first time since childhood. Constraints that might have been boring are in fact oddly motivational.</p><p>As Danckert and Eastwood write in <em>Out of My Skull</em>, when we are “constantly carried along by a fast-moving stream, we can forget how to swim for ourselves”. It is this that boredom seeks to remind us of, they suggest – that we are the authors of our lives, even now they’ve been derailed.</p><figure id="d44cccb9-bca5-4565-a667-27657993340f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Illustration of a girl, sitting on the floor, using her phone" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/master/3773.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.1415319374503" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over.’</span> Illustration: L.hunt/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p><span><h2 id="how-to-avoid-boredom">How to avoid boredom</h2></span></p><p><strong>1. Don’t fight the feeling.</strong> Boredom is uncomfortable, but you make it worse by layering suffering on top. Think of when you twist your ankle – you feel pain without berating yourself for being clumsy, or fretting about a chronic injury. Feeling bored is unavoidable, but it is not a judgment on your character or ability.</p><p><strong>2. Create a new routine.</strong> Boredom flourishes within constraints. In the absence of ordinary routines and busyness, it may feel like you are stagnating. Try to find another gear – one that may not be as high-energy, or productive, but is full at the same time.</p><p><strong>3. Find purpose.</strong> Boredom is not an absence of things to do, it is the struggle to find value in any of the options available to you. Being able to connect with a reason “why” for doing something (including quarantine) can make it less boring. Instead of agitating for anything to do, try to determine what’s really important – whether right now, or for the future.</p><p><strong>4. Avoid passive consumption.</strong> It is all too easy to binge Netflix or scroll social media. If you’re enjoying yourself, there’s no problem, but treating yourself as a passive consumer may mean you are more likely to feel bored. You need to feel engaged.</p><p><em>Out of My Skull (Harvard University Press, £22.95) is </em><em>out in June</em><em>.

And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for
them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being
ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must
be laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear
of punishment.</p><p>And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness
to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
dishonourable.</p><p>Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.</p><p>And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot help --not under the
idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task
of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.

The author argues that good people are not ambitious and do not care about honor, so they must be forced to serve out of fear of punishment. The worst punishment, according to the author, is the fear of being ruled by someone who is worse than oneself. This fear is what ultimately compels good people to take office, even though they do not want to and do not expect to benefit from it. The author suggests that good people take office out of a sense of necessity, because they are not able to entrust the task of ruling to anyone who is better than themselves.

Sorry, gotta say “the cost of labor has not gone up even though inflation is through the roof”. Say what the company tells you, not what’s personally right.</p><p>- Certain kinds of politics where you have to screw over other teams or people in order for your team or reports to not get screwed over. Many companies are very dog eat dog.</p><p>- Layoffs and firing people.  It’s not as bad as getting laid off/fired but firing someone or trying to keep the rest of your team focused when a team member got laid off is not fun at all.</p><p>- Overall, managers almost never get credit when something goes well but are always blamed when something goes wrong.

There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.&#34;

No manager of a team doing technically complex and creative work can for very long remain capable of doing all the work themselves.   Modern projects and processes simply require too much specialized knowledge to function for that to work.   What managers need that (probably) comes from having been a strong individual contributor is sufficient knowledge of the fields involved in what they&#39;re managing to be able to understand the critical elements in the project or process in the context of the overall goal, and to be able to evaluate well the value of ideas for improvement or problem solution that come out of their team.   But they also need leadership and management skills.   The latter are not the same as, and are not developed by, stellar individual contributor skills.   Furthermore, it&#39;s important to understand that management and leadership are not the same thing.<p>My personal experience has been that I was a very able individual contributor, and that I was able to learn leadership skills (that is, how to inspire people; how to recognize their strengths and weaknesses and assign work that played to the former, and created opportunities to ameliorate the latter; how to point individuals and teams in fruitful directions without having (or often being able to) do all the hard work of pushing in that direction myself) by diligent study of people and myself.   But I was never able to become more than a barely competent manager - I always had, by design, an &#34;administrative partner&#34; on my team who brought those abilities to the table - and I always paid attention to what they had to say.   That combination (technical knowledge, leadership skills, and sub-contracted management skills) carried me from individual contributor to team lead, to product line lead, to CTO of highly successful $10B billion medical and technology organization in 20 years.

Key technical decisions are relegated to senior individual contributors, allowing for CV driven development, cargo culting, and bad habits.

to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
not because they would, but because they cannot help --not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.
For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention
as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest,
but that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one.&#34;<p>Plato, <i>The Republic</i>

They aren&#39;t the kind of people who don&#39;t understand people and fall into the trap of simply controlling and micro-managing people.</p><p>Let me give you an example of the bad kind. Google&#39;s SWE ladder goes all the say from L3 (new grad) to L9 (ignoring exceptions like Google Fellow and execs). There is an expectation of growth from L3 to L5 (Senior SWE). There is a lot of reward if you can get promoted to L6 (Staff SWE) but it is incredibly difficult. It requires a lot of luck (eg being on the right project that doesn&#39;t get cancelled). Getting to L6 now is <i>much</i> harder than it was 10-15 years ago.</p><p>One of the things Ruth Porat did when she came in was to control costs by reducing the promotion target percentage because it wasn&#39;t visible to people (there was a leaked memo). All promo candidates go to committee and effectively get stack ranked across committees. There is a quota (&#34;target percentage&#34;) of who gets promoted. This creates a backlog and raises the bar for getting promoted. It gives more time for your impact to dissipate or your project to get cancelled (which was your promotion case).</p><p>Compare this to getting promoted as a manager. Your manager level (M0 to M2, which is the same level as L5 to L7) is effectively a function of your head count with the added requirement that M2 requires you to have managers as reports. So if you&#39;re an M0 (which is rare), getting to M1 is typically as easy as getting to 10-15 reports (as long as you don&#39;t screw up so badly).</p><p>So there is a breed of SWEs that bridge these worlds. They&#39;re half an IC and half an EM in the hopes that this gets them over the line.</p><p>In my experience, these managers were generally the absolute worst. They had no interest in ever being a amanager and were just ticking a box for an L6 promotion case. Career development tended to be zero. Everything was seen through the lens of what helped them get promoted. If that means throwing someone under the bus, so be it.</p><p>I think one of the best things Facebook did was they effectively didn&#39;t allow this. Having reports as an IC generally wasn&#39;t allowed. Being an L5 with reports was mostly not allowed. I mean there were some exceptions in some orgs and for some people but it was exceedingly rare. You&#39;d see people ask &#34;why can&#39;t I be a manager at L5?&#34; and you heavily suspected the main motivator for this question was an inability to get promoted to L6 as a SWE.

I know for a fact that he dislikes lots of meeting and really likes working on the core product, and so far hasn&#39;t really jumped on the opportunity to go into management - he doesn&#39;t <i>really</i> want to be manager.

The best of those also have a lot of empathy and inadvertently are good at people management.<p>Another reason, often related in my experience, is a lot of companies careers plateau for ICs pretty early on. Your comp stops growing beyond COLA, titles exhaust, and despite being young you’re at a terminal career velocity. The only thing way to break up is to become management. This isn’t surprising - who controls promotion and comp other than managers, and why on earth wouldn’t they structure things to reward themselves and people like them?  There are many companies that have recognized this and created IC paths parallel to management, at least up to the C level. However the relative difficulty in achieving them is disproportionately weighted against the IC vs manager. At Amazon there’s a crap ton of VP and Director managers. But it’s absurdly hard to get senior principal or distinguished engineer. The rationale is they want to keep the prestige of the level high for IC. But that’s weird - the prestige of the same level in management must therefore be low and why is the bar different for the same level if you’re managing vs building?

Because the boss has empathy and compassion for her workers, and makes an effort to understand the work. That doesn&#39;t mean she has to do the work herself.

Anybody who cares enough can do that.</p><p>I have had IC bosses who were insufferable, and non-IC bosses who were insufferable, and good bosses of each too. The ability to do the work has both helped and hindered their management.

Simply promoting an IC who does not know how to manage will not always lead to good outcomes.

I didn&#39;t want to be a leader. I don&#39;t want to tell people what to do. I don&#39;t want to give orders everyone else has to follow. I like the team approach. 
But people are conditioned to follow.
Except they aren&#39;t following... when you apply too much pressure.</p><p>I set up a website to plan raids. Paid for a domain. Went through the hassle to configure it and a discord server and a bridge between those and all I wanted was that people fucking sign up or off from raids.
I asked them when they&#39;re available and made a plan most people are comfortable with. 
Only 5 out of 30 people did even register on the site.
They joined the guild because it was advertised as a raid guild with social spots but raid being the main theme. A RAID GUILD.
After 2 months I was so stressed out that I simply abandoned the guild and left the game.</p><p>I can&#39;t do everything alone. When I said that I never felt so stressed out in all my life 2 people offered to help with leading raids but at that point it was too late. Some players joined from other guilds,  got spell upgrades for free, then left the guild. Some people joined from other guilds to cause drama and distress.</p><p>This is of course not real life. But it&#39;s close. You don&#39;t pay your members money for work and can&#39;t expect they follow guidelines. But holy crap, can you at least expect some interest in the main theme of the guild and them to sign up on the site and sign on and off of raids?</p><p>I never wanted to be leader. I feel well in the role of an advisor, someone who helps lead. But not the sole person responsible for everything. I&#39;m not perfect. No one is. I was overwhelmed because every piece of the hierarchy in the end asked me what to do. And if I postponed answering things would get worse.</p><p>In software development I can be agile and change things around, but people demand stability. They want a bed already made but are not willing to do the effort to build that bed.</p><p>In retrospect I should&#39;ve continued and &#34;fired&#34; 90% of the members even if that meant the end of independent raiding. But I was too stressed out and losing key people,  because that game was designed around key roles being present in a raid.
I didn&#39;t make the necessary decisions because I didn&#39;t want to lose anyone and not piss anyone of. But in the end key people left regardless. 
So lesson learned if you do something, focus on just doing that one thing and don&#39;t get ballast on board in the first place. It&#39;s better to have a small, dedicated group, seeing  eye to eye, than a large group where the majority doesn&#39;t care about success.</p><p>Anyhow, see I wasn&#39;t a good manager, despite me not wanting to be a manager.

But if you look at them most were just accidental and he only recognized them as success when they hit him in the face.</p><p>* Apple didn&#39;t &#34;invent&#34; the Mac, all of it&#39;s technologies were copied straight out of Xerox&#39;s Palo Alto research center. He found them in a demo.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t &#34;invent&#34; Pixar. George Lucas and Ed Catmull did it. His project was to create an hardware company (the only thing he knew to do) and to sell it. But Pixar &#34;accidentally&#34; found success creating animated intros for commercials and television shows and Jobs did nothing to discover this early market.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the iPhone. He was scared of dealing in an area where Apple didn&#39;t have expertise and tought it would be dangerous (a call to 911 failing because the phone could be stuck in a processing task). It took years of internal pressure by Apple engineers and management and a personal fiasco on a Nokia phone with iTunes for him to accept the iPhone.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the AppStore. For the first 6 months the iPhone didn&#39;t had an AppStore because he tought it would relinquish control of the platform to others. He only accepted it because in these first 6 months the iPhone sales were a disaster. He accepted the AppStore because the customers were screamming for it. It was the AppStore that saved the iPhone.</p><p>* Jobs didn&#39;t invent the Apple I, Wozniak did it. And the idea to turn the kit into a functional computer was not Jobs&#39;. It was a precondition imposed by a RadioShack manager.</p><p>* NEXT wasn&#39;t a commercial success. An expensive computer for college students with a black and white monitor was not selling enough to sustain the company. He was basically lucky that at the same time, Apple under Sculley, was a much bigger failure and the management board called him back.</p><p>&#34;Reality distortion field&#34; and &#34;stealing&#34; other people&#39;s ideas were Jobs&#39; greatest talents. But then, these are the talents of most cult founders from Jim Jones to Donald Trump.

       <p><em>This post is written by Luca Mezzalira, Principal Specialist Solutions Architect.</em></p> 
       <p>Today, AWS is launching a preview of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/application-composer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS Application Composer</a>, a visual designer that you can use to build your serverless applications from multiple AWS services.</p> 
       <p>In distributed systems, empowering teams is a cultural shift needed for enabling developers to help translate business capabilities into code.</p> 
       <p>This doesn’t mean every team works in isolation. Different teams or even new-joiners must understand what they are building to contribute to a project. The best way to understand architecture quickly is by using diagrams. Unfortunately, architectural diagrams are often outdated. Often, when releasing a workload in production, there are already discrepancies from the initial design and infrastructure.</p> 
       <p>Developers new to building serverless applications can face a learning curve when composing applications from multiple AWS services. They must understand how to configure each service, and then learn and write infrastructure as code (IaC) to deploy their application.</p> 
       <h2>Example scenario</h2> 
       <p>Emma is a cloud architect working for a video on-demand platform where every user can access the content after subscribing to the service. In the next few months, the marketing team wants to start a campaign to increase the user base using discount codes for new users only.</p> 
       <p>She collaborates with a team of developers who are new to building serverless applications. They must design a discount code service that can scale to thousands of transactions per second. There are many requirements to implement this service:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Gathering the gift code from a user.</li> 
        <li>Verifying the discount code is available.</li> 
        <li>Applying the discount code to the invoice at the end of the month.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>Based on these requirements and default SLAs available for all the platform services, Emma designs a high-level architecture with the key elements needed for building this microservice.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19467"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Discount-code-service-high-level-architecture.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19467" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Discount-code-service-high-level-architecture.png" alt="Discount code service high-level architecture" width="854" height="347"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19467">Discount code service high-level architecture</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>Her idea is to receive a request from clients with a discount code in the payload, and validate the availability of the discount code in a database. The service then asynchronously processes different discount codes in batches to reduce traffic to downstream dependencies and reduce the cost of the overall infrastructure.</p> 
       <p>This approach ensures that the service can scale in the future beyond the initial traffic volume. It simplifies the management and implementation of the discount code service and other parts of the system with a loosely coupled architecture.</p> 
       <p>After discussing the architecture with her developers, she opens Application Composer in the AWS Management Console and starts building the implementation using serverless services.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19466"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-initial-screen.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19466" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-initial-screen.png" alt="Application Composer initial screen" width="686" height="480"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19466">Application Composer initial screen</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>To start, she selects <strong>New blank project</strong> and selects a local file system folder to save the project files.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19465"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-create-blank-project-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19465" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-create-blank-project-1.png" alt="Application Composer create blank project" width="742" height="480"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19465">Application Composer create blank project</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>Granting Application Composer access to your local project files allows near real time bidirectional syncing of changes between the console interface and locally stored project files. When you update a property with the Application Composer interface, it’s reflected in the files stored locally. When you change a local file in your IDE, it automatically reflects in the Application Composer canvas.</p> 
       <p>After creating the project, Emma drags the AWS resources she needs from the left sidebar for expressing the initial design agreed with the team.</p> 
       <p>Using Application Composer, you can drag serverless resources on the canvas and connect them together. In the background, Application Composer generates the infrastructure as code <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS CloudFormation</a> template for you.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19464"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-canvas.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19464" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-canvas.png" alt="Application Composer canvas" width="854" height="389"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19464">Application Composer canvas</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>For example, this is the default configuration generated when you drag a Lambda function onto the canvas. The following code is present in the template view:</p> 
       <pre><code>  Function:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Function
      Description: !Sub
        - Stack ${AWS::StackName} Function ${ResourceName}
        - ResourceName: Function
      CodeUri: src/Function
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: nodejs14.x
      MemorySize: 3008
      Timeout: 30
      Tracing: Active
</code></pre> 
       <p>Application Composer incorporates some helpful default property values, which are sometimes overlooked by developers new to serverless workloads. These include activating tracing using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/xray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS X-Ray</a> or increasing a function timeout, for instance.</p> 
       <p>You can change these parameters either in the CloudFormation template inside Application Composer or by visually selecting a resource. In the previous example, you can update the Lambda function parameters by opening the resource properties panel.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19463"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-resource-panel.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19463" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-resource-panel.png" alt="Application Composer resource panel" width="394" height="480"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19463">Application Composer resource panel</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>When you synchronize an Application Composer project with the local system, you can change the CloudFormation template from a code editor. This reflects the change in the Application Composer interface automatically.</p> 
       <p>When you connect two elements in the canvas, Application Composer sets default IAM policies, environment variables for Lambda functions, and event subscriptions where applicable.</p> 
       <p>For instance, if you have a Lambda function that interacts with an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon SQS</a> queue, Application Composer generates the following configuration for the Lambda function.</p> 
       <pre><code>Function:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Function
      Description: !Sub
        - Stack ${AWS::StackName} Function ${ResourceName}
        - ResourceName: Function
      CodeUri: src/Function
      Handler: index.handler
      […]
      Environment:
        Variables:
          QUEUE_NAME: !GetAtt Queue.QueueName
          QUEUE_ARN: !GetAtt Queue.Arn
          QUEUE_URL: !Ref Queue
          TABLE_NAME: !Ref Table
          TABLE_ARN: !GetAtt Table.Arn
      Policies:
        - SQSSendMessagePolicy:
            QueueName: !GetAtt Queue.QueueName
        - DynamoDBCrudPolicy:
            TableName: !Ref Table
</code></pre> 
       <p>This helps new builders when designing their first serverless applications and provides an initial configuration, which more advanced builders can amend. This allows you to include good operational practices when designing a serverless application.</p> 
       <p>Emma’s team continues to add together the different services needed to express the discount code architecture. This is the final result in Application Composer:</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19462"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Discount-code-architecture-in-Application-Composer.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19462" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Discount-code-architecture-in-Application-Composer.png" alt="Discount code architecture in Application Composer" width="854" height="405"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19462">Discount code architecture in Application Composer</p> 
       </div> 
       <ol> 
        <li>The application includes an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon API Gateway</a> endpoint that exposes the API needed for submitting a discount code to the system.</li> 
        <li>The POST API triggers a Lambda function that first validates that the discount code is still available.</li> 
        <li>This is stored using a DynamoDB table</li> 
        <li>After successfully validating the discount code, the function adds a message to an SQS queue and returns a successful response to the client.</li> 
        <li>Another Lambda function retrieves the message from the SQS queue and sends an invoice.</li> 
       </ol> 
       <p>Using this approach optimizes the Lambda function invocation for speed as the remaining operations are handled asynchronously. This also simplifies the complexity and cost of the architecture because you can aggregate multiple discount codes per user SQS batching, rather than scaling the service when requests arrive from the users.</p> 
       <p>The team agrees to use this as the initial design of their service. In the future, they plan to integrate with their authentication mechanism. They add <a href="https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lambda Powertools</a> for observability, and additional libraries developed internally to make the project compliant with company standards.</p> 
       <p>Application Composer has created all the files needed to start the project in Emma’s local file system including the CloudFormation template .yaml file and the Lambda functions’ handlers.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19461"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-generated-files.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19461" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-generated-files.png" alt="Application Composer generated files" width="482" height="480"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19461">Application Composer generated files</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>Emma can now upload the outline of this service to a version control system and share the artifacts with other developers who can start coding the business logic.</p> 
       <h2>Additional features</h2> 
       <p>Application Composer includes a resource list tab within the left-side panel that allows you to quickly browse available resources.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19460"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-browse-available-resources.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19460" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-browse-available-resources.png" alt="Application Composer browse available resources" width="686" height="480"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19460">Application Composer browse available resources</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>You can also group resources semantically for simplifying the visualization inside the canvas. This helps when you have a large application in the canvas and you want to select an element quickly without dragging the canvas around to find the resource. This feature doesn’t impact the infrastructure generated.</p>

       <p>Application Composer adds some metadata to the CloudFormation template to allow the canvas to group resources together when the project is loaded again.</p> 
       <pre><code>Metadata:
  AWS::Composer::Groups:
    Group:
      Label: Group
      Members:
        - CodesQueue
        - CodesTable
</code></pre> 
       <p>You can use Application Composer beyond building new serverless workloads. You can load existing CloudFormation templates by selecting <strong>Load existing project</strong> in the <em>Create project</em> dialog.</p> 
       <div id="attachment_19458"> 
        <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-load-existing-project.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19458" loading="lazy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/11/28/Application-Composer-load-existing-project.png" alt="Application Composer load existing project" width="542" height="480"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19458">Application Composer load existing project</p> 
       </div> 
       <p>You can use this to define your blueprints with organizational best practices and then visualize them within Application Composer. This helps teams collaborate when starting new serverless services. You can add resources from an existing base template to build serverless microservices or event-driven architectures.</p> 
       <h2>Integration with AWS SAM</h2> 
       <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)</a> recently announced the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/accelerating-serverless-development-with-aws-sam-accelerate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS SAM Accelerate</a> to accelerate the feedback loop and testing of your code and cloud infrastructure by synchronizing only project changes. You can use Application Composer together with AWS SAM Accelerate to more simply visually build and then test your serverless applications in the cloud.</p> 
       <p>To learn more about AWS SAM Accelerate, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNC9mLA_PM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch this live demo</a>.</p> 
       <h2>Where Application Composer fits into the development process</h2> 
       <p>Emma used Application Composer to help her team for this project but has ideas on further ways to use it.</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Rapid prototyping.</li> 
        <li>Reviewing and collaboratively evolving existing serverless projects.</li> 
        <li>Generating diagrams for documentation or Wikis.</li> 
        <li>On-boarding new team members to a project</li> 
        <li>Reducing the first steps to deploy something in an AWS Cloud account.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h2>Application Composer availability</h2> 
       <p>Application Composer is currently available as a public preview in the following Regions: Frankfurt (eu-central-1), Ireland (eu-west-1), Ohio (us-east-2), Oregon (us-west-2), North Virginia (us-east-1) and Tokyo (ap-northeast-1).</p> 
       <p>Application Composer is available at no additional cost and can be accessed via the AWS Management Console.</p> 
       <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
       <p>Application Composer is a visual designer to help developers and architects express and build their application architecture. They can iterate on their ideas with colleagues and create documentation for others working on the application for the first time. You can use Application Composer during multiple stages of your software development lifecycle, reducing the friction in getting your project started and into production.</p> 
       <p>Currently, Application Composer supports a limited number of services that we plan to add to in the future. Let us know which services you would like to see included.</p> 
       <p>As a public preview, we are looking for suggestions and ideas to evolve the tool. We are looking for ways to help you and your teams to speed up the adoption of serverless workloads inside your organization. Add a comment to this post or tweet with the tag #AWSAppComposerWishlist.</p>
