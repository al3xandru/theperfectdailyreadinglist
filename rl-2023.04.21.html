									<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
									<ul>
	<li>The testing diamond didn&#39;t address the problems of the testing pyramid. In fact, it avoided the problems caused by misinformation about unit tests.</li>
	<li>Opaque-box tests are not exclusive to testing through public interfaces of the system. A system is composed of many boundaries, and all of them benefit from behaviour-focused tests.</li>
	<li>By avoiding clear-box testing, the need for heavy mocking and public interfaces will drop significantly. This leads to a more maintainable test portfolio.</li>
	<li>Avoid publicly accessible code at all costs. The less code you have that is accessible, the easier it is to maintain, evolve, and refactor your code.</li>
	<li>Build architectures with a testing strategy in mind. How easy it is to test them will dictate the success of the architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was 2014 when <a href="https://dhh.dk/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> set the Software Development world on fire. He was on a <a href="https://youtu.be/9LfmrkyP81M">RailsConf</a> stage when he proclaimed that <a href="https://dhh.dk/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">&#34;TDD is Death&#34;</a>.</p>

<p>It was a bold move. But he was the leader that many unhappy with testing were looking for. Many followed along, splitting developers into two camps.</p>

								<p>That moment was the epicenter of a new wave. A wave that took us to today, where unit tests are losing importance in favor of integration tests.</p>

<p>When the famous Testing Pyramid by Mike Cohn is now reshaped as a diamond.</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to find a single reason for this movement, but it&#39;s easy to find many behind the discontentment with the existing testing practices.</p>


								
								
									
								
								<p>This happens when practices are spread like dogma, lack proper guidance, and are rooted in abstract thinking.</p>

<p>Everyone starts by doing their best. Trying, failing, and trying again. Until the moment that someone breaks the chain and presents a different path. A path to a promised low-maintenance test suite. </p>

<h2>What Is the Best Direction?</h2>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve learned in this industry is that even being a new field, we quickly forget our history. The rapid pace makes us believe that the past has no answers and that the future has many great things to unveil. I can&#39;t argue with the future perspectives, but I can tell you that our first tendency is to look for innovation instead of information. </p>

<p>Probably, the following questions would avoid many feeling the need for a Testing Diamond as a replacement for the Pyramid:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is this problem caused by unit tests or how I write unit tests?</li>
	<li>Am I applying integration testing to components that need it?</li>
	<li>Did I misunderstand anything that led me to the same assertions in multiple places? </li>
	<li>Am I improving my design through tests or testing around the existing design?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Back to Our Roots  </h2>

<p>Likely the answer is once again hidden in the past.</p>

<p>So, what does history tell us about integration tests? Historically, integration testing was the stage when different development units were tested together. Those units were developed in isolation, often by multiple teams. That was the phase when we guaranteed that the defined interfaces were well implemented and worked accordingly.</p>

<p>Nowadays, we see integration tests applied to code units developed by the same team. This implies that each source code file is a system boundary. As if each code file had been developed by an autonomous team. This is blurring the lines between unit and integration tests.</p>

<p>Based on that, we could reason that the distinction between integration and unit tests was rooted in a mistake. The idea that integration tests are for testing between teams and unit tests are for testing within a team is the wrong distinction. We were fixing a problem caused by us.</p>

<p>What we should do instead is define clear boundaries. Not layers, but boundaries between each development team. Those boundaries will give you a perspective on the system&#39;s role and how it interacts with other domains. This is similar to how Alistair Cockburn describes the <a href="https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/">Hexagonal Architecture</a>, also known as Ports and Adapters. In his work, he describes a system as having two sides. The internal and the external ones. Now, we need to bridge those two sides through well-defined boundaries.</p>

<p>How does that help? It is this internal/external relationship that makes it clear the relationship between unit and integration tests. The unit tests are responsible for testing the boundary from an outside-in perspective. While the integration tests will test the boundary from an inside-out perspective. In concrete words, we can say that integration tests ensure the correct behavior of the Adapters, Gateways, and Clients that mediate the relationship with other development units (such as APIs, Plugins, Databases, and Modules).</p>

<h2>Behavior Focused Testing</h2>

<p>What does the unit in unit tests mean? It means a unit of behavior. There&#39;s nothing in that definition dictating that a test has to focus on a single file, object, or function. Why is it difficult to write unit tests focused on behavior?</p>

<p>A common problem with many types of testing comes from a tight connection between software structure and tests. That happens when the developer loses sight of the test goal and approaches it in a clear-box (sometimes referred to as white-box) way. </p>

<p>Clear-box testing means testing with the internal design in mind to guarantee the system works correctly. This is really common in unit tests. The problem with clear-box testing is that tests tend to become too granular, and you end up with a huge number of tests that are hard to maintain due to their tight coupling to the underlying structure.</p>

<p>Part of the unhappiness around unit tests stems from this fact. Integration tests, being more removed from the underlying design, tend to be impacted less by refactoring than unit tests. </p>

<p>I like to look at things differently. Is this a benefit of integration tests or a problem caused by the clear-box testing approach? What if we had approached unit tests in an opaque-box (sometimes referred to as black-box) (behavioral driven) approach? Wouldn&#39;t we have reached similar or even better results?</p>

<p>A common misunderstanding is thinking that opaque-box testing can only be applied to the outer boundaries of our system. That is wrong. Our system is built with many boundaries. Some may be accessible through a communication protocol, while others may be extended with in-process adapters. Each adapter has its own boundaries and can be tested in a behavioral-driven approach.</p>

<h2>Mocking: All or Nothing</h2>

<p>On a clear-box testing approach, there&#39;s often heavy use of mocks. But when you overuse mocks, tests become harder to maintain. Maybe that is what Mark Seemann refers to when he says that <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/10/17/stubs-and-mocks-break-encapsulation/">stubs and mocks break encapsulation</a>.</p>

<p>Once you start facing this kind of problem due to heavy mocking, it&#39;s normal to start to hate mocking. So, you try to avoid it at all costs. An API-only testing approach will commonly lead to the need for heavy mocking.</p>

<p>Once again, I question whether it was a problem due to mocking or misusing mocks. </p>

<p>Mocks and stubs may be harder to maintain, but they exist for a reason. They have a valid role to fulfill in making tests faster and more stable. It&#39;s our responsibility to control them. We don&#39;t want to overuse them beyond where they are essential.</p>

<h2>Reduce the Public Surface of Your Code</h2>

<p>Another side effect of clear-box testing is that it leads to exposing more code than needed. Validators, mappers, and other pieces of code that could be internal implementation details are now part of the public contract just because we exposed them for the sake of testing. Also, anyone working in the Java and C# world knows how prevalent Interfaces are in their codebases. Once again, for the sake of testing. To mock a dependency, the developer might introduce an Interface.</p>

<p>Once a piece of code is accessible from the outside, it becomes harder to change, and tests become required. This will lead to code where maintainability is a problem and refactoring is almost impossible without rewriting a ton of unit tests.</p>

<p>On the surface that looks like an argument in favor of integration tests, since integration tests focus on the outer layer where many of these implementation details don&#39;t leak. </p>

<p>Once again, I ask is it a problem with unit tests, or is it a problem with the way we are implementing unit tests? If we implement unit tests in an opaque-box way, ignoring the internal design decisions and only being concerned with what consumers need, it will lead to a smaller contract. A contract that is easier to test, with fewer tests, and tests that are easier to maintain.</p>

<h2>Architecture as the Guiding Principle</h2>

<p>Tests tend to grow around architecture. We design our systems, then we think about testing. When we do that, systems can become harder to test. We have seen that happen with multi-layer architectures, where the dependency on data access technology brings complexity when unit testing the domain layer.</p>

<p>That can easily be avoided by adopting an architecture with test isolation in mind. From Hexagonal Architecture to Clean Architecture, we have many options from which we can pick.</p>

<p>This type of architecture is built to be device independent. All infrastructure dependencies are plugged into the system through dependency configuration. This type of architecture will make unit testing comfortable and lead you to use integration tests for what they should be: testing adapters to the outside world.</p>

<p>Integration testing adapters only introduce a weak spot into our testing strategy. When you integration test with all the components connected, you gain the advantage of testing things like configuration and composition. We obviously want to test that. We can still run tests with all components connected. The difference is that those become &#34;smoke tests&#34; and don&#39;t need to test every single corner case. That will lead to more stable and reliable tests.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It is as important to question old beliefs in the industry as it is to know them well before starting to question them.</p>

<p>We know the past repeats itself. We know that the past also informs our decisions about the future. We should also know that we will inevitably make the same mistakes over and over again. It&#39;s human nature, so it&#39;s up to us to avoid doing it.</p>

<p>Testing strategies are one of those cases where we tend to repeat our mistakes. We are addressing the pain caused by a lack of good information and education while avoiding the existing good practices.</p>

<p>Testing and architecture are deeply connected. It&#39;s up to us to design architectures with testing in mind. And unit testing will still be a tool we use in our pursuit of good testing strategies.</p>

                                <p>Like many success stories at Amazon, this one begins with a customer anecdote.</p><p>One evening a few months ago, my wife and I, like millions of other people, were casually flipping between different streaming services and trying to decide what to watch. Neither one of us was particularly invested in the outcome. We idly scrolled, clicked a bit, and we’d sporadically say “meh” at each other’s half-hearted suggestions.</p><p>On the Prime Video application, my wife suddenly became annoyed and asked: “Why are there so many duplicates? Look! I scroll down and there are the same titles, again and again. Let me count! This one shows up three times! This one shows up four times! Why can’t you fix this, Mr. Fancy Principal Engineer?”</p><p>This was a decidedly different tone to the other “mehs” because my wife was genuinely frustrated about this duplication of titles. Fortunately, I work at Prime Video. I could figure this out. I could find out why this happens and then maybe do something about it.</p><h3>Finding the problem</h3><p>The Prime Video storefront works by loading carousels in “page” size chunks. A page is a list of carousels (for example, the page with the “home” ID is what customers see when they start up the application). On the first page, customers see ten carousels and then, as they scroll down, we load the next ten. The first chunk of ten is page one and the second chunk is page two. Every carousel’s content is personalized. Not just personalized to a cohort but personalized for every customer. Even for a given customer, they’ll see different carousels depending on what device they’re on and where they are in the world. Of course, this will make any self-respecting cache burst into tears of rage and indignation. The key space is way too large for any kind of caching or precalculating solution.</p><p>The next important factor is that at Prime Video’s scale, we work pretty hard to avoid holding session state. For example, we don’t store anything server-side for what the customer saw on page one. Instead, any information we need to build page two from page one must be in the paging request. Clients use an opaque page state token they receive in every page response in subsequent paging requests.</p><p>The unfortunate side effect of this stateless approach is that each page showed customers its “best” content. Great titles on page one that are in carousels on page two are still the best and will show up again. This means that customers end up with too much of a good thing.</p><p>A naive approach would be to ask the clients (devices) to remove duplicates. They have all the content, so why can’t they remove them? Well, Prime Video has nine different clients and each client organization has multiple teams. Coordinating this business logic across all these teams would mean that customers will experience divergent content across their devices. The logic is also fiddly (for example, in some factual cases like a top ten list, we might not want to remove duplicates), so replicating it across clients will be met with a lot of angry, disappointed looks and “How could you?” from our future selves when we looked back at this decision. Even if we didn’t mind this, we’d also have to wait for all customers to upgrade their devices.</p><h3><b>Building the solution</b></h3><p>To remove these pesky duplicates without client work, we needed a way to tell page two about the awesome things that happened on page one. We could persist them server-side all in a store or a cache, but the cost becomes mind-bogglingly high at our scale. It also means that by the time a customer is on page ten, we’re checking hundreds of titles against thousands of titles for duplicates.</p><p>I needed a data structure that was size-bounded (so that things don’t get worse as customers keep scrolling) and small enough to pass back-and-forth with every request. I could use the existing opaque paging state token to stuff this data in to avoid any new device-side logic. Most importantly, I didn’t need to find a perfect solution, I just needed to make the problem less awful. Enter bloom filters.</p><p>A bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure. You can put a lot of “Things” in it, and then ask if it’s seen a “Thing” before. The space efficiency comes from the filter storing a small hash of the Thing, as long as you don’t mind the odd false positive. If you’re curious about the implementation details, there’s a wealth of information about this available on the internet.</p><p>For my purposes I didn’t need anything particularly clever. I chose to use Guava’s built-in Bloom Filter class. Over a few days I took this up as a hobby project, adding the filter, and passing it through to an encoded token to devices, which then dutifully returned it back in their paging requests so I could reconstruct the filter and check for Things, and throw in new Things (up to a configured limit, beyond which the filter becomes “full” and the false-positive rate shoots up). Selecting the “right” size for the filter is, as everything, a tradeoff. The more accurate the filter is (more items, lower false positive rate), the larger the payload increase. The larger the payload, the bigger the impact to end to end latency.</p><h3>Testing it out</h3><p>After I wrote the code, the next step was to send it into production and see what happens. Of course, I had to verify that the new experience was better for customers. I needed an A/B test to verify whether my changes were better in some measurable way.</p><p>To run my test, I used our internal version of <span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0">Amazon CloudWatch Evidently</a></span>. I knew that the customer experience must become nicer. Heeding the stern warnings of my Fourth Grade English teacher that you must never use “nice” to describe anything, I now needed to somehow quantify content “nice.” But was that 10% nicer? Six absolute “nices?”</p><p>At Prime Video, we have many output metrics. These are metrics that we can measure for how customers interact with our service, things we can’t directly control. Input metrics are the things under our control, so if we select the right input metrics to optimize then hopefully we would see a bump in output metrics.</p><p>The challenge here was choosing the correct output metric. Reducing duplicates isn’t going to increase Amazon Prime signups, so clearly that’d be a poor success metric to pick. We finally landed on converted coverage as the right metric. Converted coverage is the average number of unique TV show seasons or movie titles watched by a thousand customers across a locale. The theory is that if customers see more unique titles and less duplicates, the number would go up and customers would watch a wider variety of titles.</p><p>After I chose my success metric and put in the A/B allocation code, I launched my bloom filter and waited anxiously for the results to start rolling in. I had two treatments for different filter sizes. One treatment would deduplicate across four pages and the other treatment across six pages. I chose the two treatments based to minimize the increase in payload size, to get some benefit from the deduplication without impacting customer perceived latency.</p><p>The experiment ran for a month; a shorter duration would risk not getting statistically significant data on certain customer groupings (such as occasional customers, or customers that haven’t streamed anything in three months), and I was in no particular rush (this was a hobby project after all). The results were surprising. It turns out that customers don’t mind some duplication if its sufficiently spaced out. The treatment that won out was the four page one. What was more surprising was how much of a win this seemingly trivial change delivered. It drove millions of new title discovery streams and significantly impacted the converted coverage metric that I’d chosen as the launch criteria.</p><h3>Lessons learned</h3><p>So, what’s the lesson of this story? For me, it’s that you should take all customer anecdotes seriously. A late-evening quibble with my wife led to an awful lot of fun puttering about in codebases that I was not intimately familiar with. Mostly though, I was reminded that no matter how big, complex, or daunting your space is, curiosity and bias for action can still be massively impactful!</p>

<p><span>UPDATE</span></p>
<p><span>Several years ago on my 68th birthday I wrote up 68 bits of advice for my adult children, and posted them here. </span><span>The bits were extremely popular, and they were widely shared by others. I was encouraged to write up more bits of wisdom on my following two birthdays. On my 70th birthday I wrote up 103 bits of advice I wish I had known earlier, which were also widely shared. The first six bits are here:</span></p>
<p>• About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.</p>
<p>• No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.</p>
<p>• Don’t ever work for someone you don’t want to become.</p>
<p>• Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.</p>
<p>• Don’t keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.</p>
<p>• If you stop to listen to a musician or street performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dollar.</p>
<p><span>The full set of advice was such a hit that Viking Penguin books thought they should be in a book, and I thought so too. So I gathered the three lists, weeded out the weak ones, polished up the best, and then I wrote an additional 150 more bits of advice, until I had 450 of them. I put them all into a small book you can slip into your pocket. This book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3tTKAlc">Excellent Advice for Living</a>, is designed to be the perfect gift.  I already know it makes a fantastic graduation gift. You can order it on Amazon <a href="https://amzn.to/3tTKAlc">here</a>.</span></p>
