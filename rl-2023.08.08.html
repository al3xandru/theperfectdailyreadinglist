   * cloud cover vs. sun
   * wind speeds (with direction)
   * precipitation likelihood and amounts
   * barometric pressure
   * overall conditions
</code></pre>
Note only that, but I can mouseover the display and get per-hour specific details for every parameter.<p>During storm season, with 1 click I can get to the &#34;wundermap&#34; which gives me 45-60 mins of storm tracking display, allowing me to make my own guess on whether or not a given storm complex is going to hit us head on or not, using &#34;local knowledge&#34; to shape my conclusion.

Sometimes I want a sense of the trends, it isn&#39;t like I plan 10 days out based on precip numbers. Though a range would give me a direction to lean. Coordinating with friends who tell me about a chance of rain in a week as a reason to alter plans is frustrating.<p>It looks like the yr.no chart view that I&#39;ve used on my phone for years. I appreciate having the pressure, precip, temp on separate but aligned charts to avoid too much density.</p><p>Weather representation is hard though. I care about different things at different times of year. In the winter: temp, freezing line, precip, wind speed/direction, and jet stream postion in 4-12 hour increments.</p><p>In the summer: temp, cloud cover, thunderstorm chance, precip on a 12 hour tto daily level. But I care about wind speed and direction on a hourly level for water activities.</p><p>In both cases I like an easy way to see the radar/satellite images and sometimes the model trends so I can see where precip or cloud cover is more or less.

That was great because my dog hates rain. I&#39;ve often dropped what I was doing immediately and get out earlier because of a Dark Sky notification. If it told me I had 25 minutes before rain started, I really had 25 minutes.<p>I&#39;ve noticed that it got progressively less accurate the closer it got of the shutdown by Apple.</p><p>The iOS weather app is pretty inaccurate and borderline useless in comparison. It will tell me it&#39;s raining when it&#39;s not and vice/versa. Time predictions are so out of whack that they might as well not be there; they also get revised all the time.</p><p>I understand that weather can be finnicky and predictions are just that. But Dark Sky did it correctly and Apple does not. I wonder what was the point of acquiring them, if their UI is inferior (although pretty!) and so are the predictions.

It seems to me that their usual mode of operation is to completely ignore feedback, and then after a decade or so, they come back with some portion of it and act like it&#39;s a thing they completely invented.

On top of that some features were undiscoverable - for example it was possible to click bubbles on the right side of the graph to get detailed view of the hour. Very useful, I stumbled on it randomly after years of use.<p>Weather has same information, presented a bit in a different way. Sure, I think they could have done better job.</p><p>Most important component, however, are the models they use. Weather/Dark Sky models are good, but at some moment they diverge from Wundeground - another app I use. So I started paying for Windy, which allows you to see a view with 6 (!) different models. I&#39;m not sure why I <i>need</i> that, but I love having this feature.

Nothing accurately forecasts (here) whether it will be freezing or whether precipitation will be snow/slush/hail/rain, but other apps like Apple&#39;s are absolutely horrific at forecasting precipitation even a few hours out. Stuff like showing 30% chance of rain in 1 hour, clear the rest of the day, when it just rains the entire day and the &#34;forecast&#34; continually shows that it will stop raining in 30 minutes.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I&#39;ve always thought they could be improved by showing the overnight low, which you&#39;re saying is the case for some weather apps. Which ones are those?<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that the midnight-to-midnight scheme is a lot more well-defined than the alternative we&#39;re both advocating. What do you show as the low temperature for today if it&#39;s currently 3am and the temperature isn&#39;t going to drop until 3am tomorrow? If that temperature drop is displayed as today&#39;s low temperature, then I won&#39;t be able to discern whether it will get cold <i>during this night</i> (i.e. today between 1am and 7am) or <i>the following night</i> (i.e. between 7pm today and 7am tomorrow). Not to mention that cold systems can move in at any time, and it may be much colder at noon tomorrow than 3am tomorrow, so in many case &#34;overnight low&#34; isn&#39;t even what you care about.

Perhaps it&#39;s a name thing? &#34;Nobody&#34;, eg the public at large (so, set aside the passionate Dark Sky love you see in this thread), gives a shit about weather apps, at least on a broad scale.

If I buy a different weather app, Apple actually gets more money! Buying a different phone because Apple made the decision to kill my favorite weather app is now muddled in with so many other factors and Apple and their shareholders are unlikely to link a drop in phone sales to killing the weather app. Now I also need to look at the very few real competitors and probably have issues with them as well. It&#39;s a mess because they all do too much. Maybe I don&#39;t want Android devices because Google built Bart without disclosing training sources. What a mess!</p><p>b) someone builds something nice and it just gets killed by an incumbant. No real competition between most startups and incumbants. It&#39;s more like a buyer/seller relation</p><p>I&#39;d love to see this all fixed in my utopia by prohibiting acquisitions and instead force companies to fight for customers. But I&#39;m sure that would need to happen globally to avoid putting our own companies at a disadvantage where they&#39;ll just get their lunch stolen by companies that aren&#39;t limited like that.

One thing which always annoys me is how they handle rain predictions. They give &#34;probabilities&#34; for rain. But what do those mean? The probability that it rains for at least one minute in the given time frame? And with at least x mm/inches of rain coming down? And isn&#39;t a low probability of short and weak rain totally different from a equally low probability of strong or long rain?<p>But there is a perfectly elegant alternative: Just use the <i>expected amount of rainfall</i>. The epected value combines both amount and probability of rainfall in one single number, without being highly arbitrary like other approaches, such as the usual reporting of plain &#34;probabilities&#34; with unclear interpretation.</p><p>(Of course one could add to the expected rainfall amount also the variance, to distinguish more certain predictions from more uncertain ones, though this information might often not even be that important.)

Hence I prefer the text forecasts from the NWS, which list an amount possible, plus more in thunderstorms, rather than a bare number.<p>Meanwhile the &#39;probability&#39; listed in forecasts is also well defined as an expected value - it&#39;s (probability of X% rain coverage) * (X %), over all X.

The probability of precipitation forecast is one of the most least understood elements of the weather forecast. The probability of precipitation has the following features:
..... The likelihood of occurrence of precipitation is stated as a percentage
..... A measurable amount is defined as 0.01&#34; (one hundredth of an inch) or more
(usually produces enough runoff for puddles to form)
..... The measurement is of liquid precipitation or the water equivalent of frozen
precipitation
..... The probability is for a specified time period (i.e., today, this afternoon, tonight,
Thursday)
..... The probability forecast is for any given point in the forecast area
To summarize, the probability of precipitation is simply a statistical probability of 0.01&#34; inch of more of precipitation at a given area in the given forecast area in the time period specified. Using a 40% probability of rain as an example, it does not mean (1) that 40% of the area will be covered by precipitation at given time in the given forecast area or (2) that you will be seeing precipitation 40% of the time in the given forecast area for the given forecast time period.
Let&#39;s look at an example of what the probability does mean. If a forecast for a given county says that there is a 40% chance of rain this afternoon, then there is a 40% chance of rain at any point in the county from noon to 6 p.m. local time.
This point probability of precipitation is predetermined and arrived at by the forecaster by multiplying two factors:
Forecaster certainty that precipitation will form or move into the area X
Areal coverage of precipitation that is expected
(and then moving the decimal point two places to the left)
Using this, here are two examples giving the same statistical result:
(1) If the forecaster was 80% certain that rain would develop but only expected to cover 50% of the forecast area, then the forecast would read &#34;a 40% chance of rain&#34; for any given location. (2) If the forecaster expected a widespread area of precipitation with 100% coverage to approach, but he/she was only 40% certain that it would reach the forecast area, this would, as well, result in a &#34;40% chance of rain&#34; at any given location in the forecast area.

Basically, you don&#39;t need a jacket if the rainfall is very unlikely, or weak, or short. In all those cases the expected amount will be low.

		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>F</span></span>ew people would mistake a wolf for a dog. But if you saw the ancestor of the domestic cat in your backyard, your first thought would likely be “What a cool-looking housecat!” rather than “What’s an African wildcat doing in Manchester?” That’s how little they’ve changed, earning them the tag “barely” or “semi-domesticated”. There have been some minor anatomical shifts – domestic cats have longer intestines and smaller brains, for example – but very few genetic ones (and certainly many fewer than separate dogs from their wild ancestors). What about behaviour, then? Which of the traits we commonly associate with our furry friends are the result of domestication, and which do they share with their wild relatives?</p><p>Let’s start with the classic cat sound. Anyone who has lived with a cat has experienced their household companion meowing to them, clearly trying to communicate something or other (perhaps “dinner time” or “Help, I’m locked in the closet”). I had always assumed that cats talked to each other by meowing, and that they were just including us in their social circle. However, detailed behavioural <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/463206/" data-link-name="in body link">observations</a> of unowned groups of cats living in southern England have revealed that they rarely meow among themselves.</p><p>Does this finding indicate that cats evolved the ability to meow over the last few thousand years as part of the domestication process? Nope. All small species of wild feline – of which there are many – meow. Instead, the domestic cat has modified this sound, making it shorter, higher-pitched and more pleasing to our ears. Researchers have <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0735-7036.118.3.287" data-link-name="in body link">suggested</a> that humans have an innate preference for high-pitched sounds and that cats adapted accordingly.</p><p>And it’s not just the meow. Scientists at the University of Sussex <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209011683" data-link-name="in body link">have shown</a> that when cats want something (usually food), they deploy an insistent, chainsaw-like purr that bears some phonetic resemblance to a human baby’s cry. Other small feline species also purr, so this is most likely another example of an existing trait cleverly adapted to manipulate us into getting what they want.</p><p>However, there is one behaviour that domestic cats exhibit that is nearly unique among felines and thus must be a trait involved during domestication; nonetheless, it is directed to other cats as much as it is to humans. When my cat, Nelson, gets out of our garden, I have to go and find him. As I call to him in my best “Nelson, buddy” voice, he eventually starts walking, or sometimes running, towards me. As he gets closer, his tail springs straight up into the air, a rear-end exclamation point; when he gets to me, he rubs his cheeks and flank against my leg, purring the whole time. Sometimes he behaves similarly inside when he’s in a loving mood, approaching with tail held high, then licking my hand or foot in exchange for caresses, sometimes even rolling on his back for belly rubs.</p><p>Domestic cats use this same flagpole signal when they interact with each other: the upright tail means “I come in peace” or maybe “Glad to see you!” It’s an indication they want to engage in other friendly behaviours such as head- and body-rubbing, nose-touching and sniffing; other cats return the vertical salute to show they’re receptive to such an interaction. The fact that cats use their tails to signal amiable intentions to us as well is a great tribute, indicating we’ve attained honorary cat status.</p><p>Only one other feline species uses its tail in a similar way. Surprisingly, it’s not a similar-sized relative, but, rather, the king of the jungle. When greeting each other, members of a lion pride will raise their tails – though more in a curved semicircle than straight up.</p><p>How did two such different felines end up acting in the same way? Well, consider that lions are deservedly known as the only truly social wild feline species, living in prides of as many as 20 cats. The core of the pride is made up of females, all of whom are related. Pride members are famous for their sociability: grooming, playing, lying on top of one another, even nursing each other’s cubs and hunting cooperatively.</p><p>Domestic cats are thought to be like other felines: solitary, aloof and asocial. But that is not always the case. When unowned cats occur in large, dense populations – as happens when people provide a lot of food – they do live in groups, composed mainly of related females. Like lions, the cats are extremely sociable, even serving as midwives during birth, and again like lions, they are unfriendly to members of other groups. Why a group of cats is called a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clowder" data-link-name="in body link">clowder</a> and not a pride is beyond me.</p><p>This similar social structure is what explains the independent evolution of tail-signalling in cats and lions. When interactions are common, a way of indicating friendly intentions is needed, and what better piece of anatomy to use than a tail – visible at a distance and not used for other purposes?</p><p>Why, then, do we consider domestic cats to be loners? Remember that the key aspect of lion and domestic cat groups is that they are made up of female relatives. But when multiple cats are brought together in the same house, they often arrive at different times, from different families. Not surprisingly, they frequently don’t get along. Although it’s not impossible for two unrelated cats to develop a friendly relationship, a better approach is to bring littermates into a home together.</p><p>The domestic cat may not have evolved much from the African wildcat, but the changes that have occurred have produced household companions that are both friendlier and better able to manipulate us. Some breeds have been selected to be even more attentive chums, essentially dogs in cat’s clothing. For example, without any training at all, Nelson announces playtime by bringing his toys and dropping them at my feet, fetching them when they’re thrown across the room. And as for the disturbing claim that your cat would eat you if you died at home and your body weren’t discovered: don’t believe it. Research <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/would-your-dog-eat-you-if-you-died-get-the-facts" data-link-name="in body link">shows</a> that dogs are the culprit much more frequently. Despite the still‑wild nature of cats, I know which species I prefer to live with.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-12" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p><em>Jonathan B Losos is professor of biology at Washington University in St Louis</em><em> and author of The Age of Cats: From the Savannah to Your Sofa (William Collins)</em><em>,</em> <em>published in the United States as</em> <em>The Cat’s Meow (Viking)</em><em>.</em><br/></p><p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/what-cats-want-9781526623065?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link">What Cats Want</a>: An Illustrated Guide for Truly Understanding Your Cat by Dr Yuki Hattori (‎Bloomsbury, £12.99)</p><p><a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-language-of-cats-9780263267518?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link">The Secret Language of Cats</a>: How to Understand Your Cat for a Better, Happier Relationship by Susanne Schötz (HQ Digital, £8.99)</p><p><a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/cat-sense-9780241960455?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link">Cat Sense</a>: The Feline Enigma Revealed by John Bradshaw (Penguin, £10.99)</p></div></div>

I reprogrammed the right Alt key.</figcaption></figure><p id="cb89">Before I ordered any hardware, I wanted to try with stuff I already had. I have a <a href="https://kono.store/products/whitefox-mechanical-keyboard" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">WhiteFox mechanical keyboard</a> that has open firmware that is fully reprogrammable. I was able to assign a high function key to an extra key there and use that as “Push To Talk”. That was very cool. Depending on your keyboard you may be able to do something similar and have a dedicated zoom PTT key.</p><figure></figure><p id="d469">I was confident enough at this point to order some hardware. I started with a pedal. There are a lot of options out there and many of them are focused on transcriptionists. I decided to splurge a bit and got a high end pedal — the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/savant-elite2-dual-pedal/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Kinesis Savant Elite2</a>. It seems like some really solid hardware.</p><p id="43f7">Programming this pedal is interesting. You flip it into “programming mode” and it then mounts as a USB drive. You can use their utility or, even better, just edit a text file on that drive. Note that I had to <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/savant-elite2/#firmware-updates" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">upgrade the firmware</a> on the pedal to have it be able to address F19. But after that things we easy.</p><p id="0891">I set it up with the left pedal as “push to talk” (F19) and the right pedal as “toggle mute” (shift-F19).</p><pre><span id="4cdd">[lpedal]&gt;[f19]<br/>{rpedal}&gt;{-shift}{f19}{+shift}</span></pre><p id="9dc5">While searching for the right pedal I ran across the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">elgato Stream Deck</a>. This thing is awesome. It is a programmable keypad with LEDs in each key. The 15 button version ran me ~$150.</p><figure><figcaption>The colors look a little strange here. It looks better in real life.</figcaption></figure><p id="d6cb">While primarily aimed at streamers (with builtin in actions for twitch and OBS) it is more general purpose than that. I was able to program it to hit all the various flavors of F19 that I needed and created custom images for each key. I also was able to put a world clock on there, volume controls, and OBS scene buttons for when I’m doing <a href="https://tgik.io" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">TGIK</a>.</p><p id="a399">I ginned up some icons quickly in Illustrator and exported them as 72px x 72px PNGs. If you want them let me know and I’ll post them someplace. For reference the Zoom icons are: hang up, push to talk, toggle mute, toggle camera, bring Zoom into focus.</p><p id="b6b6">The one downside: the state of mute/unmute isn’t reflected on the button. That’d be cool.</p><p id="3c66">I’m probably done for now. I’ll probably tweak a bit but no major changes. I wish that the Zoom Mac app had better interfaces or an SDK as that would make integration easier. But oh well. It does look like the <a href="https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/overview/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Stream Deck does have an SDK</a> and that would be fun to play with.</p><p id="7a3f">Thanks for everyone that had suggestions and pointers through this project!</p></div></div>
