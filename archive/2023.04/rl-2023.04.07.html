<p>Recent layoffs across the tech sector are an example of “social contagion” – companies are laying off workers because everyone is doing it, says Stanford business Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer.<span> (Image credit: Courtesy Jeffrey Pfeffer)</span></p>
</div>
<p>What explains why so many companies are laying large numbers of their workforce off? The answer is simple: copycat behavior, according to Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/">Stanford Graduate School of Business</a>.</p>
<p>Here, Stanford News talks to Pfeffer about how the workforce reductions that are happening across the tech industry are a result mostly of “social contagion”: Behavior spreads through a network as companies almost mindlessly copy what others are doing. When a few firms fire staff, others will probably follow suit. Most problematic, it’s <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/relationship-between-workplace-stressors-mortality-health-costs-united">a behavior that kills people</a>: For example, research has shown that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0004867414521502?casa_token=OieOknD1x3sAAAAA%3AGCMM6HLFsevJ-PxWun6vFwuw32rCvEyGj22OgwfMs7enT3_f_yy3v8Ok1yln-4xcS5czl-vVfbBS">layoffs can increase the odds of suicide by two times or more</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.careerusa.org/resources/career-files/158-resources/career-files/16-must-read-articles/372-lay-off-the-layoffs.html">Moreover, layoffs don’t work to improve company performance,</a> Pfeffer adds. Academic studies have shown that time and time again, workplace reductions don’t do much for paring costs. Severance packages cost money, layoffs increase unemployment insurance rates, and cuts reduce workplace morale and productivity as remaining employees are left wondering, “Could I be fired too?”</p>
<p>For over four decades, Pfeffer, the Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Organizational Behavior, has studied hiring and firing practices in companies across the world. He’s met with business leaders at some of the country’s top companies and their employees to learn what makes – and doesn’t make – effective, evidence-based management. His recent book <a href="https://jeffreypfeffer.com/books/dying-for-a-paycheck/"><em>Dying for a Paycheck: How Modern Management Harms Employee Health and</em></a> <a href="https://jeffreypfeffer.com/books/dying-for-a-paycheck/"><em>Company Performance–And What We Can Do About It</em></a> (Harper Business, 2018) looks at how management practices, including layoffs, are hurting, and in some cases, killing workers.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>

<p><strong>Why are so many tech companies laying people off right now?</strong></p>
<p>The tech industry layoffs are basically an instance of social contagion, in which companies imitate what others are doing. If you look for reasons for why companies do layoffs, the reason is that everybody else is doing it. Layoffs <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580324?origin=crossref#metadata_info_tab_contents">are the result of imitative behavior</a> and are not particularly evidence-based.</p>
<p>I’ve had people say to me that they know layoffs are harmful to company well-being, let alone the well-being of employees, and don’t accomplish much, but everybody is doing layoffs and their board is asking why they aren’t doing layoffs also.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think layoffs in tech are some indication of a tech bubble bursting or the company preparing for a recession?</strong></p>
<p>Could there be a tech recession? Yes. Was there a bubble in valuations? Absolutely. Did Meta overhire? Probably. But is that why they are laying people off? Of course not. Meta has plenty of money. These companies are all making money. They are doing it because other companies are doing it.</p>

<p><strong>What are some myths or misunderstandings about layoffs?</strong></p>
<p>Layoffs often do not cut costs, as there are many instances of laid-off employees being hired back as contractors, with companies paying the contracting firm. Layoffs often do not increase stock prices, in part because layoffs can signal that a company is having difficulty. Layoffs do not increase productivity. Layoffs do not solve what is often the underlying problem, which is often an ineffective strategy, a loss of market share, or too little revenue. Layoffs are basically a bad decision.</p>
<p>Companies sometimes lay off people that they have just recruited – oftentimes with paid recruitment bonuses. When the economy turns back in the next 12, 14, or 18 months, they will go back to the market and compete with the same companies to hire talent. They are basically buying labor at a high price and selling low. Not the best decision.</p>
<p>People don’t pay attention to the evidence against layoffs. The evidence is pretty extensive, some of it is reviewed in the book I wrote on human resource management, <em>The Human Equation: Building Profits by Putting People First.</em> If companies paid attention to the evidence, they could get some competitive leverage because they would actually be basing their decisions on science.</p>

<p><strong>You’ve written about the negative health effects of layoffs. Can you talk about some of the research on this topic by you and others?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/relationship-between-workplace-stressors-mortality-health-costs-united">Layoffs kill people, literally</a>. They kill people in a number of ways. Layoffs increase the odds of suicide by two and a half times. This is also true outside of the United States, even in countries with better social safety nets than the U.S., like New Zealand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w13626">Layoffs increase mortality by 15-20% over the following 20 years.</a></p>
<p>There are also health and attitudinal consequences <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.20102">for managers who are laying people off</a> as well as for the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/211390591_Downsizing_Effects_on_Survivors_Layoffs_Offshoring_and_Outsourcing">employees who remain</a>. Not surprisingly, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00420-010-0609-0">layoffs increase people’s stress</a>. Stress, like many attitudes and emotions, is contagious. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-depression-contagious/">Depression is contagious</a>, and layoffs increase stress and depression, which are bad for health.</p>
<p>Unhealthy stress leads to a variety of behaviors such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1763376/">smoking</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4121498">drinking more</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9550944/">drug taking</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5403578/">overeating</a>. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201705/stress-and-addiction">Stress is also related to addiction</a>, and layoffs of course increase stress.</p>

<p><strong>What was your reaction to some of the recent headlines of mass layoffs, like Meta laying off 11,000 employees?</strong></p>
<p>I am concerned. Most of my recent research is focused on the effect of the workplace on human health and how economic insecurity is bad for people. This is on the heels of the COVID pandemic and the social isolation resulting from that, which was also bad for people.</p>
<p>We ought to place a higher priority on human life.</p>

<p><strong>If layoffs are contagious within an industry, could it then spread across industries, leading to other sectors cutting staff?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it already has. Layoffs are contagious across industries and within industries. The logic driving this, which doesn’t sound like very sensible logic because it’s not, is people say, “Everybody else is doing it, why aren’t we?”</p>
<p>Retailers are pre-emptively laying off staff, even as final demand remains uncertain. Apparently, many organizations will trade off a worse customer experience for reduced staffing costs, not taking into account the well-established finding that is typically much more expensive to attract new customers than it is to keep existing ones happy.</p>

<p><strong>Are there past examples of contagious layoffs like the one we are seeing now, and what lessons were learned?</strong></p>
<p>After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, every airline except Southwest did layoffs. By the end of that year, Southwest, which did not do any layoffs, gained market share. A.G. Lafley, who was the former CEO of Procter and Gamble, said the best time to gain ground on your competition is when they are in retreat – when they are cutting their services, when they are cutting their product innovation because they have laid people off. James Goodnight, the CEO of the software company SAS Institute, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2014/05/12/an-interview-with-the-godfather-of-data-analytics-sass-jim-goodnight/?sh=372c5241ba8d">has also never done layoffs</a> – he actually hired during the last two recessions because he said it’s the best time to pick up talent.</p>

<p><strong>Any advice to workers who may have been laid off?</strong></p>
<p>My advice to a worker who has been laid off is when they find a job in a company where they say people are their most important asset, they actually check to be sure that the company behaves consistently with that espoused value when times are tough.</p>

<p><strong>If layoffs don’t work, what is a better solution for companies that want to mitigate the problems they believe layoffs will address?</strong></p>
<p>One thing that Lincoln Electric, which is a famous manufacturer of arc welding equipment, did well is instead of laying off 10% of their workforce, they had everybody take a 10% wage cut except for senior management, which took a larger cut. So instead of giving 100% of the pain to 10% of the people, they give 100% of the people 10% of the pain.</p>
<p>Companies could use economic stringency as an opportunity, as Goodnight at the SAS Institute did in the 2008 recession and in the 2000 tech recession. He used the downturn <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/sas-institute-ceo-jim-goodnight-on-building-strong-companies-and-a-more-competitive-u-s-workforce/">to upgrade workforce skills</a> as competitors eliminated jobs, thereby putting talent on the street. He actually hired during the 2000 recession and saw it as an opportunity to gain ground on the competition and gain market share when everybody was cutting jobs and stopped innovating. And it is [an opportunity]. Social media is not going away. Artificial intelligence, statistical software, and web services industries – none of these things are going to disappear.</p>

<p>this collection of thoughts on software development gathered by grug brain developer</p>
<p>grug brain developer not so smart, but grug brain developer program many long year and learn some things
although mostly still confused</p>
<p>grug brain developer try collect learns into small, easily digestible and funny page, not only for you, the young grug, but also for him
because as grug brain developer get older he forget important things, like what had for breakfast or if put pants on</p>
<p>big brained developers are many, and some not expected to like this, make sour face</p>
<p><em>THINK</em> they are big brained developers many, many more, and more even definitely probably maybe not like this, many
sour face (such is internet)</p>
<p>(note: grug once think big brained but learn hard way)</p>
<p>is fine!</p>
<p>is free country sort of and end of day not really matter too much, but grug hope you fun reading and maybe learn from
many, many mistake grug make over long program life</p>

<p>apex predator of grug is complexity</p>
<p>complexity bad</p>
<p>say again:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p><em>you</em> say now:</p>
<p>complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<p>given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex</p>
<p>complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain
developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime</p>
<p>one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!</p>
<p>next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!</p>
<p>grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense presence in code base</p>
<p>demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock mock ha ha so funny
grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior advise</p>
<p>club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with club: sometimes grug
himself!</p>
<p>sadly, often grug himself</p>
<p>so grug say again and say often: complexity <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> bad</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-no"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-no">Saying No</a></h2>
<p>best weapon against complexity spirit demon is magic word: &#34;no&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;no, grug not build that feature&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;no, grug not build that abstraction&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;no, grug not put water on body every day or drink less black think juice you stop repeat ask now&#34;</p>
<p>note, this good engineering advice but bad career advice: &#34;yes&#34; is magic word for more shiney rock and put in
charge of large tribe of developer</p>
<p>sad but true: learn &#34;yes&#34; then learn blame other grugs when fail, ideal career advice</p>
<p>but grug must to grug be true, and &#34;no&#34; is magic grug word.  Hard say at first, especially if you nice grug and don&#39;t like
disappoint people (many such grugs!) but  easier over time even though shiney rock pile not as high as might otherwise be</p>
<p>is ok: how many shiney rock grug really need anyway?</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-saying-ok"></a><a href="#grug-on-saying-ok">Saying ok</a></h2>
<p>sometimes compromise necessary or no shiney rock, mean no dinosaur meat, not good, wife firmly remind grug
about young grugs at home need roof, food, and so forth, no interest in complexity demon spirit rant by grug for
fiftieth time</p>
<p>in this situation, grug recommend &#34;ok&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;ok, grug build that feature&#34;</p>
<p>then grug spend time think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 solution</a> to problem and build that instead.<br/>
80/20 solution say &#34;80 want with 20 code&#34;  solution maybe not have all bell-whistle that project manager want, maybe a
little ugly, but work and deliver most value, and keep demon complexity spirit at bay for most part to extent</p>
<p>sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way.  easier forgive than permission, project managers
mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs.  often forget what even feature supposed to do or move on or
quit or get fired grug see many such cases</p>
<p>anyway is in project managers best interest anyway so grug not to feel too bad for this approach usually</p>
<h2><a name="grug-on-factring-your-code"></a><a href="#grug-on-factring-your-code">Factoring Your Code</a></h2>
<p>next strategy very harder: break code base up properly (fancy word: &#34;factor your code properly&#34;)  here is hard give general
advice because each system so different.  however, one thing grug come to believe: not factor your application too early!</p>
<p>early on in project everything very abstract and like water: very little solid holds for grug&#39;s struggling brain to hang
on to.  take time to develop &#34;shape&#34; of system and learn what even doing.  grug try not to factor in early part of project
and then, at some point, good cut-points emerge from code base</p>
<p>good cut point has narrow interface with rest of system: small number of functions or abstractions that hide complexity
demon internally, like trapped in crystal</p>
<p>grug quite satisfied when complexity demon trapped properly in crystal, is best feeling to trap mortal enemy!</p>
<p>grug try watch patiently as cut points emerge from code and slowly refactor, with code base taking shape over time along
with experience.  no hard/ fast rule for this: grug know cut point when grug see cut point, just take time to build
skill in seeing, patience</p>
<p>sometimes grug go too early and get abstractions wrong, so grug bias towards waiting</p>
<p>big brain developers often not like this at all and invent many abstractions start of project</p>
<p>grug tempted to reach for club and yell &#34;big brain no maintain code!  big brain move on next architecture committee
leave code for grug deal with!&#34;</p>
<p>but grug learn control passions, major difference between grug and animal</p>
<p>instead grug try to limit damage of big brain developer early in project by giving them thing like
UML diagram (not hurt code, probably throw away anyway) or by demanding working demo tomorrow</p>
<p>working demo especially good trick: force big brain make something to actually work to talk about and code to look at that do
thing, will help big brain see reality on ground more quickly</p>
<p>remember!  big brain have big brain!  need only be harness for good and not in service of spirit complexity demon on
accident, many times seen</p>
<p>(best grug brain able to herd multiple big brain in right direction and produce many complexity demon trap crystals, large
shiney rock pile awaits such grug!)</p>
<p>also sometimes call demo approach &#34;prototype&#34;, sound fancier to project manager</p>
<p>grug say prototype early in software making, <em>especially</em> if many big brains</p>

<p>grug have love/hate relationship with test: test save grug many, many uncountable time and grug love and respect test</p>
<p>unfortunately also many test shamans exist.  some test shaman make test idol, demand things like &#34;first test&#34; before grug
even write code or have any idea what grug doing domain!</p>
<p>how grug test what grug not even understand domain yet!?</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t worry: the tests will show you what you need to do.&#34;</p>
<p>grug once again catch grug slowly reaching for club, but grug stay calm</p>
<p>grug instead prefer write most tests after prototype phase, when code has begun firm up</p>
<p>but, note well: grug must here be very disciplined!</p>
<p>easy grug to move on and not write tests because &#34;work on grugs machine&#34;!</p>
<p>this very, very bad: no guarantee work on other machine and no guarantee work on grug machine in future, many times</p>
<p>test shaman have good point on importance of test, even if test shaman often sometimes not complete useful
feature in life and talk only about test all time, deserve of club but heart in right place</p>
<p>also, test shaman often talk unit test very much, but grug not find so useful.  grug experience that ideal tests are not
unit test or either end-to-end test, but in-between test</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit tests</a> fine, ok, but break as implementation change (much compared api!)
and make refactor hard and, frankly, many bugs anyway often due interactions other code.  often throw away when code change.</p>
<p>grug write unit test mostly at start of project, help get things going but not get too attached or expect value long time</p>
<p><a href="https://smartbear.com/solutions/end-to-end-testing/">end to end</a> tests good, show whole system work, but! hard to
understand when break and drive grug crazy very often, sometimes grugs just end up ignoring because &#34;oh, that break all
time&#34;  very bad!</p>
<p>in-between tests, grug hear shaman call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">&#34;integration tests&#34;</a> sometime
often with sour look on face. but grug say integration test sweet spot according to grug: high level enough test correctness
of system, low level enough, with good debugger, easy to see what break</p>
<p>grug prefer some unit tests especially at start but not 100% all code test and definitely not &#34;first test&#34;.  &#34;test along
the way&#34; work pretty well for grug, especially as grug figure things out</p>
<p>grug focus much ferocious integration test effort as cut point emerge and system stabilize!  cut point api hopefully stable
compared implementation and integration test remain valuable many long time, and easy debug</p>
<p>also small, well curated end-to-end test suite is created to be kept working religiously on pain of clubbing. focus of important
end-to-end test on most common UI features and few most important edge cases, but not too many or become impossible maintain
and then ignored</p>
<p>this ideal set of test to grug</p>
<p>you may not like, but this peak grug testing</p>
<p>also, grug dislike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mocking</a> in test, prefer only when absolute necessary
to (rare/never) and coarse grain mocking (cut points/systems) only at that</p>
<p>one exception &#34;first test&#34; dislike by grug: when bug found.  grug always try first reproduce bug with regression test
<em>then</em> fix bug, this case only for some reason work better</p>

<p>grug think agile not terrible, not good</p>
<p>end of day, not worst way to organize development, maybe better than others grug supposes is fine</p>
<p>danger, however, is agile shaman!  many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman!</p>
<p>whenever agile project fail, agile shaman say &#34;you didn&#39;t do agile right!&#34;  grug note this awfully convenient for agile
shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger!</p>
<p>grug tempted reach for club when too much agile talk happen but always stay calm</p>
<p>prototyping, tools and hiring good grugs better key to success software: agile process ok and help some but sometimes hurt taken
too seriously</p>
<p>grug say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">no silver club</a> fix all software problems no matter what agile
shaman say (danger!)</p>

<p>refactoring fine activity and often good idea, especially later in project when code firmed up</p>
<p>however, grug note that many times in career &#34;refactors&#34; go horribly off rails and end up causing more harm than good</p>
<p>grug not sure exactly why some refactors work well, some fail, but grug notice that larger refactor, more
likely failure appear to be</p>
<p>so grug try to keep refactors relatively small and not be &#34;too far out from shore&#34; during refactor.  ideally system work
entire time and each step of finish before other begin.</p>
<p>end-to-end tests are life saver here, but often very hard understand why broke... such is refactor life.</p>
<p>also grug notice that introducing too much abstraction often lead to refactor failure and system failure.  good example
was <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/j2ee/">J2EE</a> introduce, many big brain sit around thinking too much abstraction, nothing good came of it many project hurt</p>
<p>another good example when company grug work for introduce <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/OSGi">OSGi</a> to help
manage/trap spriit complexity demon in code base.  not only OSGi not help, but make complexity demon much more powerful!
took multiple man year of best developers to rework as well to boot!  more complex spirit and now features impossible
implement! very bad!</p>

<p>wise grug shaman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton">chesterton</a> once say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>here exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>many older grug learn this lesson well not start tearing code out willy nilly, no matter how ugly look</p>
<p>grug understand all programmer platonists at some level wish music of spheres perfection in code.  but danger is here,
world is ugly and gronky many times and so also must code be</p>
<p>humility not often come big brained or think big brained
easily or grug even, but grug often find &#34;oh, grug no like look of this, grug fix&#34; lead many hours pain grug and no better or system
worse even</p>
<p>grug early on in career often charge into code base waving club wildly and smash up everything, learn not good</p>
<p>grug not say no improve system ever, quite foolish, but recommend take time understand system first especially bigger system is and
is respect code working today even if not perfect</p>
<p>here tests often good hint for why fence not to be smashed!</p>

<p>grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too</p>
<p>seem very confusing to grug</p>

<p>grug love tool.  tool and control passion what separate grug from dinosaurs!  tool allow grug brain to create code that
not possible otherwise by doing thinking for grug, always good relief! grug always spend time in new place learning
tools around him to maximize productivity: learn tools for two weeks make development often twice faster and often
have dig around ask other developers help, no docs</p>
<p>code completion in IDE allow grug not have remembered all API, very important!</p>
<p>java programming nearly impossible without it for grug!</p>
<p>really make grug think some time</p>
<p>good debugger worth weight in shiney rocks, in fact also more: when faced with bug grug would often trade all shiney rock and
perhaps few children for good debugger and anyway debugger no weigh anything far as grug can tell</p>
<p>grug always recommend new programmer learn available debugger very deeply, features like conditional break points, expression
evaluation, stack navigation, etc teach new grug more about computer than university class often!</p>
<p>grug say never be not improving tooling</p>

<p>grug very like type systems make programming easier.  for grug, type systems most value when grug hit dot on keyboard and
list of things grug can do pop up magic.  this 90% of value of type system or more to grug</p>
<p>big brain type system shaman often say type correctness main point type system, but grug note some big brain type system
shaman not often ship code.  grug suppose code never shipped is correct, in some sense, but not really what grug mean
when say correct</p>
<p>grug say tool magic pop up of what can do and complete of code major most benefit of type system, correctness also good but not
so nearly so much</p>
<p>also, often sometimes caution beware big brains here!</p>
<p>some type big brain think in type systems and talk in lemmas, potential danger!</p>
<p>danger abstraction too high, big brain type system code become astral projection of platonic generic turing model of
computation into code base.  grug confused and agree some level very elegant but also very hard do anything like
record number of club inventory for Grug Inc. task at hand</p>
<p>generics especially dangerous here, grug try limit generics to container classes for most part where most value add</p>
<p>temptation generics very large is trick!  spirit demon complex love this one trick! beware!</p>
<p>always most value type system come: hit dot see what grug can do, never forget!</p>

<p>grug once like to minimize lines of code much as possible.  write code like this:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact &amp;&amp; !contact.isActive() &amp;&amp; (contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS))) {
    // ...
  }
</code></pre>
<p>over time grug learn this hard debug, learn prefer write like so:</p>
<pre><code>  if(contact) {
    var contactIsInactive = !contact.isActive();
    var contactIsFamilyOrFriends = contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS);
    if(contactIsInactive &amp;&amp; contactIsFamilyOrFriends) {
        // ...
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>grug hear screams from young grugs at horror of many line of code and pointless variable and grug prepare defend self with club</p>
<p>club fight start with other developers attack and grug yell: &#34;easier debug!  see result of each expression more clearly and good name!  easier
understand conditional expression!  EASIER DEBUG!&#34;</p>
<p>definitely easier debug and once club fight end calm down and young grug think a bit, they realize grug right</p>
<p>grug still catch grug writing code like first example and often regret, so grug not judge young grug</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> mean Don&#39;t Repeat Self, powerful maxim over mind of most
developers</p>
<p>grug respect DRY and good advice, however grug recommend balance in all things, as gruggest big brain aristotle recommend</p>
<p>grug note humourous graph by Lea Verou correspond with grug passion not repeat:</p>
<img alt="code concerns over time" src="https://grugbrain.dev/over-time.png"/>
<p>over time past ten years program grug not as concerned repeat code.  so long as repeat code simple enough and obvious
enough, and grug begin feel repeat/copy paste code with small variation is better than many callback/closures passed arguments
or elaborate object model: too hard complex for too little benefit at times</p>
<p>hard balance here, repeat code always still make grug stare and say &#34;mmm&#34; often, but experience show repeat code
sometimes often better than complex DRY solution</p>
<p>note well!  grug encourage over literal developer not take does work line too serious, is joke</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concern (SoC)</a> another powerful idea over many developer
mind, idea to separate different aspects of system into distinct sections code</p>
<p>canonical example from web development: separation of style (css file), markup (html file) and logic (javascript file)</p>
<p>here grug much more sour faced than DRY and in fact write big brained essay on alternative design principle
<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">locality of behavior (LoB)</a> against SoC</p>
<p>grug much prefer put code on the thing that do the thing.  now when grug look at the thing grug know the thing what the
thing do, alwasy good relief!</p>
<p>when separate of concern grug must often all over tarnation many file look understand what how button do, much confuse
and time waste: bad!</p>

<p>grug like closures for right job and that job usually abstracting operation over collection of objects</p>
<p>grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil things too much use
give heart attack</p>
<p>javascript developers call very special complexity demon spirit in javascript &#34;callback hell&#34; because too much closure
used by javascript libraries very sad but also javascript developer get what deserved let grug be frank</p>

<p>grug huge fan of logging and encourage lots of it, especially in cloud deployed.  some non-grugs say logging expensive
and not important.  grug used think this way no more</p>
<p>funny story: grug learn idol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">rob pike</a> working on logging at google and decide:
&#34;if rob pike working on logging, what grug do there?!?&#34; so not pursue.  turn out logging <em>very</em> important to google so
of course best programmer work on it, grug!</p>
<p>don&#39;t be such grug brain, grug, much less shiney rock now!</p>
<p>oh well, grug end up at good company anyway and rob pike dress habit
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KINIAgRpkDA">increasingly erratic</a>, so all work out in end, but
point stand: logging very important!</p>
<p>grug tips on logging are:</p>
<ul>
<li>log all major logical branches within code (if/for)</li>
<li>if &#34;request&#34; span multiple machine in cloud infrastructure, include request ID in all so logs can be grouped</li>
<li>if possible make log level dynamically controlled, so grug can turn on/off when need debug issue (many!)</li>
<li>if possible make log level per user, so can debug specific user issue</li>
</ul>
<p>last two points are especially handy club when fighting bugs in production systems very often</p>
<p>unfortunately log libraries often very complex (java, <a href="https://stackify.com/logging-java/">why you do?</a>) but worth investing
time in getting logging infrastructure &#34;just right&#34; pay off big later in grug experience</p>
<p>logging need taught more in schools, grug think</p>

<p>grug, like all sane developer, fear concurrency</p>
<p>as much as possible, grug try to rely on simple concurrency models like stateless web request handlers and simple
remote job worker queues where jobs no interdepend and simple api</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic concurrency</a> seem work well for web stuff</p>
<p>occasionally grug reach for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">thread local variable</a>, usually when
writing framework code</p>
<p>some language have good concurrent data structure, like java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">ConcurrentHashMap</a>
but still need careful grug work to get right</p>
<p>grug has never used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)">erlang</a>, hear good things, but language
look wierd to grug sorry</p>

<p>ultra biggest of brain developer once say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>premature optimization is the root of all evil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this everyone mostly know and grug in humble violent agreement with ultra biggest of big brain</p>
<p>grug recommend always to have concrete, real world perf profile showing specific perf issue before begin optimizing.</p>
<p>never know what actual issue might be, grug often surprise!  very often!</p>
<p>beware only cpu focus: easy to see cpu and much big o notation thinking having been done in school,
but often not root of all slowness, surprise to many including grug</p>
<p>hitting network equivalent of many, many millions cpu cycle and always to be minimized if possible, note well big brain
microservice developer!</p>
<p>inexperienced big brain developer see nested loop and often say &#34;O(n^2)?  Not on my watch!&#34;</p>
<p>complexity demon spirit smile</p>

<p>grug love good apis.  good apis not make grug think too much</p>
<p>unfortunately, many apis very bad, make grug think quite a bit.  this happen many reasons, here two:</p>
<ul>
<li>API creators think in terms of implementation or domain of API, rather than in terms of use of API</li>
<li>API creators think too abstract and big brained</li>
</ul>
<p>usually grug not care too deeply about detail of api: want write file or sort list or whatever, just want to call
<code>write()</code> or <code>sort()</code> or whatever</p>
<p>but big brain api developers say:</p>
<p>&#34;not so fast, grug!  is that file <em>open for write</em>? did you define a <em>Comparator</em> for that sort?&#34;</p>
<p>grug find self restraining hand reaching for club again</p>
<p>not care about that stuff right now, just want sort and write file mr big brain!</p>
<p>grug recognize that big brain api designer have point and that <em>sometime</em> these things matter, but often do not.
big brain api developers better if design for simple cases with simple api, make complex cases possible
with more complex api</p>
<p>grug call this &#34;layering&#34; apis: two or three different apis at different level complexity for various grug needs</p>
<p>also, if object oriented, put api on thing instead of elsewhere. java worst at this!</p>
<p>grug want filter list in java</p>
<p>&#34;Did you convert it to a stream?&#34;</p>
<p>fine, grug convert to stream</p>
<p>&#34;OK, now you can filter.&#34;</p>
<p>OK, but now need return list!  have stream!</p>
<p>&#34;Well, did you collect your stream into a list?&#34;</p>
<p>what?</p>
<p>&#34;Define a Collector&lt;? super T, A, R&gt; to collect your stream into a list&#34;</p>
<p>grug now swear on ancestor grave he club every single person in room, but count two instead and remain calm</p>
<p>put common thing like <code>filter()</code> on list and make return list, listen well big brain java api developer!</p>
<p>nobody care about &#34;stream&#34; or even hear of &#34;stream&#34; before, is not networking api, all java grugs use list mr big brain!</p>

<p>grug love make programming language at drop of hat and
say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent</a>
most fun and beautiful way create parser</p>
<p>unfortunately many big brain school teach only parser generator tool.  here grug usual love of tool is not: parser
generator tool generate code of awful snakes nest: impossible understand, bottom up, what?  hide recursive nature of
grammar from grug and debug impossible, very bad according grug!</p>
<p>grug think this because while complexity demon bad for code base and understand, complexity demon very good for generation
of much academic papers, sad but true</p>
<p>production parser almost always recursive descent, despite ignore by schools!  grug furious when learn how simple parse
is! parsing not big brain only magic: so can you!</p>
<p>grug very elated find big brain developer Bob Nystrom redeem the big brain tribe and write excellent book on recursive
descent: <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></p>
<p>book available online free, but grug highly recommend all interested grugs purchase book on general principle, provide
much big brain advice and grug love book <em>very</em> much except visitor pattern (trap!)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">bad</a></p>

<p>some non-grugs, when faced with web development say:</p>
<p>&#34;I know, I&#39;ll split my front end and back end codebase up and use a hot new SPA library talking to a GraphQL JSON API back end
over HTTP (which is funny because I&#39;m not transferring hypertext)&#34;</p>
<p>now you have two complexity demon spirit lairs</p>
<p>and, what is worse, front end complexity demon spirit even more powerful and have deep spiritual hold on entire front end
industry as far as grug can tell</p>
<p>back end developers try keep things simple and can work ok, but front end developers make very complex very quickly and
introduce lots of code, demon complex spirit</p>
<p>even when website just need put form into database or simple brochure site!</p>
<p>everyone do this now!</p>
<p>grug not sure why except maybe facebook and google say so, but that not seem very good reason to grug</p>
<p>grug not like big complex front end libraries everyone use</p>
<p>grug make <a href="https://htmx.org">htmx</a> and <a href="https://hyperscript.org">hyperscript</a> to avoid</p>
<p>keep complexity low, simple HTML, avoid lots javascript, the natural ether of spirit complexity demon</p>
<p>maybe they work for you, but no job post, sorry</p>
<p>react better for job and also some type application, but also you become alcolyte of complexity demon whether you like
or no, sorry such is front end life</p>

<p>grug note lots of fads in development, especially front end development today</p>
<p>back end better more boring because all bad ideas have tried at this point maybe (still retry some!)</p>
<p>still trying all bad ideas in front end development so still much change and hard to know</p>
<p>grug recommend taking all revolutionary new approach with grain salt: big brains have working for long
time on computers now, most ideas have tried at least once</p>
<p>grug not saying can&#39;t learn new tricks or no good new ideas, but also much of time wasted on recycled bad ideas, lots of
spirit complexity demon power come from putting new idea willy nilly into code base</p>

<p>note!  very good if senior grug willing to say publicly: &#34;hmmm, this too complex for grug&#34;!</p>
<p>many developers Fear Of Looking Dumb (FOLD), grug also at one time FOLD, but grug learn get over: very important senior
grug say &#34;this too complicated and confuse to me&#34;</p>
<p>this make it ok for junior grugs to admit too complex and not understand as well, often such case!  FOLD major source of
complexity demon power over developer, especially young grugs!</p>
<p>take FOLD power away, very good of senior grug!</p>
<p>note: important to make thinking face and look big brained when saying though.  be prepare for big brain or, worse and
much more common, <em>thinks</em> is big brain to make snide remark of grug</p>
<p>be strong! no FOLD!</p>
<p>club sometimes useful here, but more often sense of humor and especially last failed project by big brain very useful,
so collect and be calm</p>

<p>grug note many such impostor feels in development</p>
<p>always grug one of two states: grug is ruler of all survey, wield code club like thor OR grug have no idea what doing</p>
<p>grug is mostly latter state most times, hide it pretty well though</p>
<p>now, grug make softwares of much work and <a href="https://star-history.com/#bigskysoftware/htmx&amp;bigskysoftware/_hyperscript&amp;Date">moderate open source success</a>
, and yet grug himself often feel not any idea what doing!  very often!  grug still fear make mistake break everyone code and
disappoint other grugs, imposter!</p>
<p>is maybe nature of programming for most grug to feel impostor and be ok with is best: nobody imposter if everybody imposter</p>
<p>any young grug read this far probably do fine in program career even if frustrations and worry is always to be there, sorry</p>

<h3 id="Preview-language-features">Preview language features</h3>
<p>In the Java language, the preview process has been effective at its primary job: ensuring that features are &#34;done right&#34; before they become final and permanent parts of the language. How? By providing a suitable window of time in which features can be improved based on user feedback. Switch expressions, text blocks, records, sealed classes, and pattern matching for <code>instanceof</code> were all successful in preview, and became much appreciated permanent features of the language.</p>
<p>Preview language features have also been effective at helping the community to adopt new features. We particularly wanted IDEs to support preview language features so that as many developers as possible could easily try them out, and IDE vendors have delivered strongly.</p>
<p>Preview language features have worked hand-in-glove with the six month cadence of JDK releases. A decade ago, a large project to evolve the Java language could not ship until all its features were worked out and the overall programming model was brought to fruition. Recall how <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/lambda/">Project Lambda</a> introduced lambda expressions + method references + local type inference + default methods + streams -- even with groundwork laid in JDK 7, it took three years of heads-down effort to forge JDK 8. Nowadays, a project like <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/">Amber</a> can ship a cascade of preview features in successive JDK releases (16, 17, 18, 19...) and eventually there&#39;s a release which previews the totality of the new programming model. For example, pattern matching started in JDK 14 with type patterns in <code>instanceof</code>, and by JDK 19 it was a recognizable programming style that encompassed <code>instanceof</code>, <code>switch</code>, records, and sealing.</p>
<p>One of our guiding principles is that we only include a preview feature in the JDK if it&#39;s truly on a journey to final-and-permanent status within a reasonable time frame. If it looks like the feature&#39;s journey will get derailed, either in quality or in time, then we must be willing to drop it after it has previewed and before it becomes permanent. Thankfully, we have not yet had to do that.</p>
<p>(Some people mistakenly believe that &#34;<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/326">Raw String Literals</a>&#34; was dropped after previewing in JDK 12, but in fact it never made JDK 12; we changed direction and previewed &#34;Text Blocks&#34; in JDK 13 instead.)</p>
<p>While small language features have successfully previewed for a short time before becoming permanent, we&#39;ve learned that large language features might need to preview more than twice, especially if they interact with other language features <em>which are themselves in preview</em>. For example, pattern matching for <code>switch</code> has previewed twice on its own merits, then twice more because of interactions with another, newer, preview feature (record patterns). Previewing three or more times reflects the ambition that all language features work together smoothly, and is incomparably better than trying to &#34;hold the train&#34; until all connected features are equally ready to preview.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, there have been no preview VM features as yet. Distinct from improvements to the HotSpot implementation (e.g., for <a href="https://inside.java/tag/gc">garbage collection</a>), JEP 12 conceived of previewing changes to the <code>class</code> file format and the instruction set of the abstract Java virtual machine. We can expect preview VM features from <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/">Project Valhalla</a> in the next few years (e.g., <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/401">primitive classes</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Preview-APIs">Preview APIs</h3>
<p>From the beginning, we realized that preview language features would often be co-developed with API points, principally to support reflection. For example, record classes previewed alongside <code>Class::getRecordComponents</code>, and sealed classes previewed alongside <code>Class::getPermittedSubclasses</code>.</p>
<p>We then realized that previewing APIs on their own merits would be valuable. The first &#34;standalone&#34; preview APIs appeared in JDK 19: the <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/425">Virtual Threads API</a> and the <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/424">Foreign Function &amp; Memory (FFM) API</a>. Sharing the preview terminology and mechanisms (e.g., <code>--enable-preview</code>) across APIs and language features has worked well.</p>
<p>Still, APIs and language features are different in an important way. A language feature has a small surface area but a broad conceptual area: think how the <code>-&gt;</code> lambda syntax is the on-ramp to the world of functional programming. Meanwhile, an API has a large surface area that more or less defines the conceptual area: &#34;the map is the territory&#34;. It&#39;s common for a language feature to change corner-case behavior in a way that doesn&#39;t affect syntax and is little noticed by programmers, but changing almost any aspect of an API is immediately and widely visible. It impacts both the programmers who invoke the API direct from applications, and the programmers who build libraries on top of the API.</p>
<p>We were upfront in JEP 12 that previewing an API is likely to involve more visible churn than previewing a language feature: &#34;a semantically stable preview API may still undergo considerable syntactic polishing (e.g., renaming classes, adding helper methods) on the way to achieving final status.&#34;</p>
<p>As an example, consider the FFM API. It aims to solve a difficult problem -- providing safe access to memory allocated and deallocated by other parties -- so its development effort has explored various API shapes for scoping/guarding access to memory. Its core concepts are stable (segments, allocators, linkers, etc) but their expression in specific API points has evolved in response to user feedback. In turn, libraries built on top of the FFM API during its preview period have needed to adapt to its changing API points.</p>
<h3 id="New-thinking-for-Preview-APIs">New thinking for Preview APIs</h3>
<p>With more preview APIs on the horizon, some with substantial surface area (e.g., the <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8280389">Classfile API</a>), we want to set the expectation that the higher degree of syntactic drift seen in preview APIs does not undermine their &#34;almost ready&#34; nature.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we&#39;ll regard an API as ready to preview when it has achieved a <em>high degree</em> of completeness and stability. We&#39;ll continue to regard a language or VM feature as ready to preview only when it has achieved an <em>extremely high degree</em> of both completeness and stability.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll preserve the guideline that, in general, a preview feature should be 100% complete within 12 months. However, this guideline -- which implies a preview feature will appear in one or two JDK releases before going final -- is likely too ambitious for APIs that capture complex concepts, have exceptionally large surface areas, or engage deeply with the VM. We should anticipate additional rounds of feedback and revision for such APIs, as they will underpin the Java ecosystem for decades to come.</p>
<p>(We considered doubling down on <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/11">incubating APIs</a> as the model for APIs which are conceptually complete but subject to syntactic drift. However, incubating APIs are non-standard and delivered in standalone &#34;incubator modules&#34;. Being non-standard means that standard <code>java.*</code> packages cannot refer to them in class/member signatures, while being delivered outside <code>java.base</code> makes implementing a low-level API such as Virtual Threads extremely difficult. In addition, the conceptual and practical differences between incubation and preview are lost on most developers. Offering high-quality, core-stable APIs under the familiar &#34;preview&#34; label will provoke far more feedback than shoehorning them into incubator modules which attract little attention. We will, however, continue to use incubation for APIs whose level of completeness and stability is <em>considerably lower</em> than that of preview APIs.)</p>
