Authentication is the part that requires a bit of toil to figure out. The rest is managing the schemas of the control plane entities. Basically, design the data and most of the rest is generated for me.</p><p>The data plane is trickier but I&#39;m experimenting with using Postgres&#39; streaming logical replication protocol to convert logical queries on the control plane data into business domain events that are forwarded onto the message queue. This is the part that uses the postgresql-replicant library I wrote but other libraries written in Python exist and can do the same thing.</p><p>This then enables me to implement business logic/data-plane actions asynchronously down-stream as isolated, stateful services that follow the event streams and react accordingly to various policies. They can then update the control plane models as they progress, which then could add more domain events to the stream, and so on. It&#39;s a bit like a functional-reactive architecture.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a <i>production ready</i> style architecture. Monitoring replication stream performance can be tricky and integration testing is challenging. And managing changes to the business domain is not a fully-solved problem: still a lot of exploration/tooling/and do-it-yourself duct-taping to do.</p><p>But it&#39;s simple enough that I can do lot of work with very little code so far.

                  <p><span>Hey, this is Ram, the author of the post. Would love to know how this architecture works in production for you. For infrastructure saas, the control plane needs to manage 100&#39;s of data planes. It also needs to own user and tenant management, security policies, billing based on usage, usage and operational insights for your users. The challenge is in building an infrastructure that can centrally manage the lifecycle of all the metadata (SaaS, app and infra) and orchestrate with all the data planes. Postgres is definitely a good building block to build on top of but there is so much to build around it to make this work well in our experience.</span></p></div></td></tr>

The services then react to the event streams in several ways: emitting events, updating control plane models, issuing new commands to other services, etc.</p><p>Each service keeps its own state internally and if I need to, I can blow away their state and replay all of the business domain events thanks to the durable message stream. That part is key... and is also the most duct-tape-and-toil area of this architecture.</p><p>I&#39;ve been toying around with ideas to generalize this into a consolidated application framework but it&#39;s still pretty experimental stuff.</p><p>The high-level architecture isn&#39;t terribly novel or new but having standardized tools for common operations, managing migrations from event schemas, managing checkpoints, etc; is still a work in progress.

Cloudflare has a very quick explainer: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-control-plane/" rel="nofollow">https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-th...</a>. To make it even shorter: a control plane is where all the coordination that controls activity (data) happens. The data plane is where the data actually moves around.<p>Explainers seem to not cover _why_ you would want to separate these &#34;planes&#34;. There are several reasons, and I&#39;m no authority, but for starters:
* control messages will have different expectations around them: their amount and frequency, delivery guarantees, urgency with which they are processed. Treating this traffic separately means you can engineer appropriately for data and control traffic. 
* last thing you want is the control message &#34;stop processing traffic from IP x.x.x.x port y&#34; to be stuck behind traffic from said IP/port...</p><p>In this context, the meaning is somewhat different. They are referring to administrative traffic vs &#34;actual work&#34; traffic. Auth, billing/accounting, configuration updates, that sort of thing. If you are running a SaaS, and your customer is very security conscious and wants none of their precious data to ever leave their VPC, you have 2 options: deploy your software into their VPC completely, making it hard to do a variety of things like upgrades, and increasing complexity; or you can separate control actions from your &#34;worker nodes&#34; and storage, and only deploy the latter into the VPC. You can then work on your control panels, monitor usage, continuously evolve various admin panels and config options, etc, using normal SaaS approaches while the security conscious customer knows that their core data is not leaving their virtual walls and only &#34;bob ran a thing and stored results&#34; goes to the vendor.</p><p>This post is about abstracting out common bits of how one implements that, and allowing SaaS offerings to provide that sort of separation easier.

                  <p><span>I should&#39;ve added, there&#39;s an obvious example for the &#34;SaaS control plane&#34; separation, which is equivalent: &#34;stop processing job X that is destabilizing the cluster&#34; should be processed without needing to fight for resources with job X.

In the context of Infrastructure SaaS, a data plane is the system that is the infrastructure that you provide as service. For example, let us say you are building a company that provides Postgres as a service. In this case, Postgres is your data plane. Typically, your users will want the Postgres to be deployed in a specific region or cloud provider.They would run queries against the Postgres cluster.<p>Control plane is the central lifecycle management system that helps provide all the SaaS experience for your Infra SaaS application, manages the metadata for your application and also pushes this information to all the data planes. Example of lifecycle management operations could be creating an user, a new organization, provisioning your data plane in a specific region, deleting a cluster etc.</p><p>The data plane is your product that you want to sell to your customers and control plane is the central system that helps you to make your product work in a self serve way with your customers.</p><p>This example can also be mapped to internal use cases. Many companies manage their own infrastructure internally and end up having to build a central control plane to manage all the different infrastructure that they provide as a service to their developers. Hope this helps.

Eg, a database server gets queries and returns rows/results. That&#39;s data plane. But when a system becomes large enough, the management stuff adds up to be notable in and of itself.<p>Pretend we&#39;re a SaaS company offering a database as a service. Adding and removing users, and the setting of passwords is control plane stuff. In a sufficiently web scale system, adding and removing users becomes, not just its own microservice, but a collection of microservices to authenticate and send updates to the main product database, and have its own separate database.

The big difference is that we (the company) ALSO manage the lifecycle of this &#34;client&#34; (i.e. shutdown, startup, repair, update). Having an untrusted client that you also manage the lifecycle of can lead to some interesting design spaces.

For a typical B2B SaaS, you typically will have a multitenant deployment in one region. The control plane APIs and data plane APIs will run in the same region. Each new customer will create a logical tenant in your DB but there are no physical data planes created.<p>For Infrastructure SaaS, it is a bit different. You typically will have different customers provision your infrastructure in different cloud or regions depending on where they have their infrastructure. This leads to having many physical infrastructure deployed in many regions and cloud providers. At the same time, for the user, you need to provide a single pane of glass experience where they can manage all their infrastructure from a single dashboard. This requires a central control plane that is responsible for all the life cycle management operations and it helps to communicate all the metadata back and forth to all the data planes. Things like upgrades, observability, user and tenant management all need coordination with the data planes. This makes the Infrastructure SaaS use case a bit different from standard B2B SaaS. Hope that helps.

told me to learn how to read a
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121514/what-difference-between-pl-statement-and-balance-sheet.asp">Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L) statement</a>.
At the time, that sounded suspiciously like, “Stop wasting my time,” but operating in an executive role has shifted my perspective
a bit: this is actually a surprisingly useful thing to learn.
The P&amp;L statement is a map of a company’s operation and is an effective tool for pointing you towards
the most pressing areas to dig in.</p><p>While there is a lot of depth to reading a P&amp;L, this will walk you
from zero to one, and will hopefully take a bit less than thirty minutes.
I’ll start by reviewing the components of a P&amp;L statement,
describe the steps I use to review a P&amp;L,
show an example of applying those steps, and end with instructions for finding
public companies P&amp;L statements to practice on.</p><h2 id="whats-in-a-pl-statement">What’s in a P&amp;L statement</h2><p>In order to review a P&amp;L statement, we need a P&amp;L statement to read,
and I’ve selected <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001720671/000119312521319849/d205906ds1.htm">Summary Consolidated Financial Data from page 18 of HashiCorp’s S-1 filing</a>.
It’ll be helpful to have that at hand to refer to throughout.</p><p><img src="https://lethain.com/static/blog/2022/hashicorp-s-1-summary.png" alt="Summary Consolidated Financial Data from HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s S-1"/></p><p>There’s a lot there! First let’s look at the top headers. The first three columns are showing revenue for 2019 through 2021.
All numbers here are “in thousands”, meaning that $18,503 is actually $18,503,000 and so on. The last two columns are looking at six month windows.
We’re trying to get a sense of the business overall, to let’s focus on the annual numbers.</p><p>When you’re looking at internal data, it’s particularly important to understand where a table shifts from historical data to forecast data.
It’s very common when talking with an early-stage startup that they’ll include their somewhat optimistic current year forecast as part of
their financial data. Public companies, on the other hand, essentially never share forecasts.
All S-1s, 10-Ks and similar documents are historical data. There are cases when reported data initially appears to be a forecast,
for example some companies end their Financial Year in January, which is the case here for Gitlab: their 2021 Financial Year
only runs through January 31st, 2021, so their 2021 results are <em>not</em> a forecast even though this report was issued on November 4th, 2021.
(Consequently, the majority of Gitlab’s 2021 performance would only become available in their 2022 Finance Year report.)</p><p><img src="https://lethain.com/static/blog/2022/hashicorp-s1-1st-3-cols.png" alt="First three columns of Summary Consolidated Financial Data from HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s S-1"/></p><p>Next, lets take a look at the columns. The sections are:</p><ol><li><strong>Revenue</strong> across a few different business lines (license, support, etc). This is how much money is booked by each business line. For example, “Support” brought in $43m of revenue in 2019</li><li><strong>Cost of revenue</strong> for each business line. This is the cost of producing the revenue. For example, “Cloud-hosted services” spent $156k in 2019 (to generate their $972k in revenue)</li><li><strong>Gross profit</strong> is “total revenue” minus “total cost of revenue”. This is how much profit the company would make <em>if</em> it had no operating expenses. For example, $170m in gross profit in 2021</li><li><strong>Operating expenses</strong> is how much money was spent operating the business. For example, $153m in 2020</li><li><strong>Loss from operations</strong> is “gross profit” plus “other income, net” minus “operating expenses”. For example, $83m in 2021</li><li><strong>Net loss</strong> is “gross profit” minus (“loss from operation” plus “provision for income taxes”). For example, $47m in 2019</li></ol><p>There are a few more rows, but everything else you can ignore from the perspective of understanding the business.</p><p>Finally, it’s worth taking a moment to dig into
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-analysis/062716/gaap-vs-nongaap-which-should-you-consider-evaluation.asp">GAAP vs Non-GAAP</a>.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board defines the accounting rules known as
GAAP, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</a>,
and most financials you’ll see will label themselves as either GAAP compliant or not, for example
this segment of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001720671/000095017022004668/hcp-20220131.htm">HashiCorp’s 10-K statement</a>.</p><p><img src="https://lethain.com/static/blog/2022/hashicorp-10-k-freecash.png" alt="Free Cash Flow from HashCorp&amp;rsquo;s 10-K calculated according to GAAP"/></p><p>There is little consistency in how companies calculate their non-GAAP financials, which makes them tricky to reason about.
Most frequently, companies exclude non-recurring or one-time expenses. Assuming you’re looking at your company’s internal P&amp;L,
the best bet is to ask someone on your Finance team to explicitly walk you through how any non-GAAP figures differ from
the GAAP definition. Often non-GAAP gives a clearer understanding of a business’ operational state, but the goal of any non-GAAP measure
is <em>always</em> crafting a narrative: make sure you understand the motivations behind that narrative!</p><h2 id="learning-from-a-pl">Learning from a P&amp;L</h2><p>Now that we’ve covered the individual components of the P&amp;L,
let’s dig into actually analyzing it.
The very first step to take is moving it into our own spreadsheet so we can do a bit of basic math,
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HTmLUi-Q3aio-AXtMpqw6f0bAg2ytSiV8b1EUrFJJvU/edit#gid=0">in this case using Google sheets</a>.
We’ll start with columns tracking year-over-year (YoY) growth.</p><p><img src="https://lethain.com/static/blog/2022/hashicorp-gsheet-1.png" alt="Moving from HashiCorp s-1 to a copy on google sheets with YoY growth as column."/></p><p>Once you have a version of the table you can edit,
the remaining steps I’d use to explore the statement are:</p><ol><li>understand relationship between revenue and cost of revenue, by business lines</li><li>explore the delta between historical trend and forecast projections (if you’re looking at a private company’s P&amp;L which includes with a forecast; this won’t apply for public data)</li><li>write down what you find surprising</li><li>identify further actions to understand those surprising areas</li></ol><p>The final step we’ll handle once we’ve collected our questions. Before that,
we’ll go through the table row by row and apply the first three steps,
starting with revenue:</p><ul><li>License revenue grew by 230% (‘19-‘20) and then 96% (‘20-‘21)</li><li>Support revenue grew by 123% (‘19-‘20) and then 71% (‘20-‘21)</li><li>Cloud services revenue grew by 141% (‘19-‘20) and then 75% (‘20-‘21)</li><li>Total revenue grew by 125% (‘19-‘20) and then 75% (‘20-‘21)</li><li>My sense of cloud services is that they’re
going at an OK clip, but a bit slower than expected given their absolute size (4m in 2021) is relatively
low. Purely from a financial analysis perspective, I’d wonder if maybe cloud services don’t yet have
a strong product-market fit or perhaps are having some go-to-market challenges.</li><li>In addition to cloud services, professional services is also small and growing slowly</li><li>Altogether, these are all reasonable revenue growth rates, particularly the support revenue
growth is strong given the absolute size of the business</li></ul><p>Another question for each of these business lines is what percentage of revenue is coming from
renewing customers and what percentage is coming from new business? The core of a good SaaS business
is a healthy renewal rate: you need a much smaller sales team to drive revenue growth if the
product does a good job of retaining existing revenue.</p><p>Next, looking at “cost of revenue.” What’s really interesting is places where cost growth is
accelerating or decelerating relative to revenue growth. For example,
license revenue grew by 96% in ‘20 to ‘21 and costs grew a bit slower at
82% in that same period. This means they’re achieving some economies
in their growth.
Conversely, it will definitely be interesting to dig into cloud services revenue and costs,
where revenue only grew 75% from ‘20 to ‘21 while costs grew 246%.
Not understanding the strategic role of cloud services, the P&amp;L doesn’t tell a particularly
optimistic story about its trajectory.</p><p>Sometimes the interesting questions come from shifts over time, for example it’s interesting
that growth in support costs outpaced support revenue growth in ‘20, but not in ‘21. Understanding
why support costs grew more slowly in ‘21 than in ‘20 will lead to a valuable insight into how
that business truly operates.</p><p>Looking at total revenue growth versus total cost of revenue growth, there’s a slightly
concerning trend that revenue is growing slower than costs in ‘20 (155% vs 125%)
and just barely faster than costs in ‘21 (75% vs 72%).
However, this is a situation where looking at percentage growth is a bit misleading.
The absolute values tell a much healthier story, as is made clear in the gross profit
line with strong positives across the line.</p><p>Next up is operating expenses. Sales and marketing (S&amp;M) spend accelerated
a fair bit in ‘20 and then decelerated in ‘21 on a relative basis.
However, on absolute basis S&amp;M costs grew by about $50m both years.
That’s a large increase and worth digging into where that spend is going.
It’s often helpful to look at the relative size across operating sections, and I personally
find it a bit surprising that “General and administration” (G&amp;A) is a larger operating cost than “Research and development” (R&amp;D)
and would love to understand that a bit better.</p><p>Finally, a quick look at net loss. This is not a profitable business, and the loss is growing.
However, losses grew more slowly than revenue growth in ‘21 and grew <em>much</em> slower than revenue
growth in ‘20. Understanding what cused that swing (at least part of it was G&amp;A costs doubling from ‘20 to ‘21)
will make the path to profitability much clearer.</p><h2 id="digging-into-the-questions">Digging into the questions</h2><p>Alright, so let’s end by considering how we might dig into
each of the surprising points (from the perspective of an internal
executive). What I’ve found most effective is grouping the questions by
team to follow up with, sending them your questions,
and then scheduling time to discuss.</p><p>Questions to dig in with the finance team:</p><ol><li>What is revenue retention by business line? How much revenue is new versus renewing? (This might be a sales team question, depends a bit on company and structure.)</li><li>Why were G&amp;A operating costs higher than R&amp;D operating costs in ‘19? Why did G&amp;A costs double from ‘20 to ‘21?</li></ol><p>Questions to ask appropriate business owners:</p><ol><li>Why is cloud services growing relatively slowly? (talk to product and sales teams)</li><li>Why are cloud services costs growing 3.5x faster than revenue?
Do we expect that to no longer be true at some point in the future?</li><li>Why did growth in support costs grow faster than support revenue growth in ‘21 but not in ‘20? What changed?</li><li>What is the additional $50m S&amp;M spend in both ‘20 and ‘21 going towards? How are we measuring efficiency of that spend?</li></ol><p>Questions that should be answered by your management team’s strategy:</p><ol><li>What is path to profitability?</li><li>What is our strategy around S&amp;M operating costs versus R&amp;D operating costs?</li></ol><p>After having these discussions, you will have a vastly clearer understanding
of your business’ reality. Before running an exercise like this, you may <em>think</em>
that you understand your business, but you were relying on other folks’ interpretation
for fuel that understanding. Now it’s your understanding driving your confidence.</p><h2 id="this-is-an-ongoing-activity">This is an ongoing activity</h2><p>After you dig through P&amp;L, you might imagine that you’re <em>done</em>. That’s true in a discrete sense,
but really your understanding is merely paused until the next iteration of the P&amp;L becomes available.
For example, we reviewed HashiCorp’s S-1 which includes their performance through January, 2021.
They shared <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001720671/000095017022004668/hcp-20220131.htm#item_8_financial_statements_supple">results through January, 2022 in their 10-K issued in March, 2022</a>.
On page 77, they have their 2022 results (meaning specifically, results through January, 2022).</p><p><img src="https://lethain.com/static/blog/2022/hashicorp-revised-10k.png" alt="HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s 2022 results from 10-K on March 25th, 2022."/></p><p>I won’t go into the full details, but if you review
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HTmLUi-Q3aio-AXtMpqw6f0bAg2ytSiV8b1EUrFJJvU/edit#gid=1870483172">this spreadsheet combining their S-1 and 10-K results</a>,
you can tell they had a challenging year.
HashiCorp is far from alone in that regard, almost everyone is having a rough year,
but if they rise to this challenge, then they might come out of this adversity as a much more profitable company.
This uncertainty is a bit part of why <a href="https://lethain.com/downturn-career-decisions/">I don’t generally recommend folks try to make financially optimal moves during a downturn</a>.</p><h2 id="finding-s-1-and-10-ks">Finding S-1 and 10-Ks</h2><p>A brief tangent on finding P&amp;L statements for public companies.
All the numbers shared in this piece are public record, and you can find them
by going to Securities and Exchange Comission’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">EDGAR search</a>
and typing in the companies name.
Using HashiCorp for an example, I started typing in “hashi” after which
search suggested HashiCorp’s ticker, “HCP”, and I clicked to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1720671&amp;owner=exclude">HashiCorp, Inc’s page</a>.
From there click on “View filings” and you can see all the interesting filings,
particularly the S-1 and 10-Ks.</p><p>Most companies will also have an investor relations (IR) website, like HashiCorp’s
<a href="https://ir.hashicorp.com/">ir.hashicorp.com</a> with links to their recent
filings like <a href="https://ir.hashicorp.com/financial-information/quarterly-results">this page hosting HashiCorp’s quarterly results</a>.
Generally, it’s easier to use EDGAR, but an IR website will often espouse
the company’s preferred narrative through their earnings calls and press releases.
Even if you do want to understand the company’s preferred narrative,
I’d recommend reading their P&amp;L without any narrative first to avoid unduly
steering your attention in their preferred direction.</p><hr/><p>As a closing thought, P&amp;Ls at early stage companies are often wrong,
and they can be wrong in a lot of different ways.
Costs can be miscategorized, non-recurring revenue can be booked as
recurring revenue, etc.
However, even when a P&amp;L is wrong, it’s almost always wrong in an interesting
way that will teach you about the underlying business and team running it.
If you really want to understand a business starting from scratch, there are few better starting places than their latest P&amp;L statement.</p><p><time datetime="2022-07-06T12:00:00-07:00">Published on July 6, 2022.</time></p></div></div>

It&#39;s a podcast focused on chatting with developers around how they build and deploy their web apps. It mostly focuses on the &#34;why&#34;, tech stack choices, libraries, workflows, lessons learned, production war stories, etc..</p><p>In my mind I thought it was a good idea but it got so little listeners that I had to abort recording new episodes due to burn out since there was no path forward to ever sustain it by outsourcing the burn out inducing parts. I still think it&#39;s a good idea but I wonder where I went wrong.</p><p>I tried everything I could think of. Guest variety from solo devs to bigger companies like Mux and Dropbox, audio editing to ensure the highest quality I could get for a remote guest&lt;-&gt;host podcast with new guests having assorted mic qualities, removing a lot of &#34;ums&#34; and other fluff but not over editing things to make it unnatural, tags to quickly find tech stacks you care about and a ton of clickable timestamps with a summary of each show that&#39;s skimmable in seconds along with tons of reference links.</p><p>On paper it feels like I did everything I could to make things &#34;good&#34;, but in practice after 100 episodes I had like 200-300 listens per episode which made it no longer viable to continue doing since each episode was about 6 hours of end to end time to put together (finding a guest, editing it, show notes, etc.).</p><p>I learned a ton from chatting with every guest and regret nothing but I overall see the podcast as a total failure since if it didn&#39;t gain any traction on it, it must be trash. I&#39;d love to revive the show because chatting with someone new about what they enjoy working on was really fun.

The stories were highly related to technology, but they usually made sense to people who knew nothing about the technology.</p><p>Even for fans of the podcast, I think the narrowness in topics means that not all fans of <i>Running in Production</i> are a match for most episodes. Comparing it to the <i>Indie Hackers</i> podcast, I&#39;d listen to any episode of IH if the guest sounds interesting because there are a lot of potential things they can say that might be useful to me. Because <i>Running in Production</i> is more narrowly about tech stacks, the percentage of episodes that are relevant to me is much smaller. I&#39;d be interested in hearing about someone talk about their Flask stack because that&#39;s what I use in my business, but if the guest is talking about Elixir or Ruby, I&#39;m unlikely to learn anything useful since I don&#39;t use or plan to use those technologies.

It&#39;s nice to hear this from the perspective of someone who was on the show.<p>I tried to make the story about going from development to production but it is for sure super focused on the technology choices that take you from A to B. There&#39;s the lessons learned which kind of apply to  any tech stack but that&#39;s also near the end of every episode so you have to listen to the whole thing to get there.</p><p>There&#39;s a number of little funny stories hidden away in some episodes. Like one guy was on vacation driving with his wife and ended up switching his web server from Apache to nginx while literally driving as a passenger.</p><p>Deployment is a tricky topic to &#34;promote&#34; because in my opinion deploying a Flask app is almost no different than Rails. If they both have a web + worker + db + cache component, it&#39;s basically the same pieces (especially if you&#39;re using Docker). The hosting provider choice, monitoring, logging, CI / CD workflows, etc. is all the same. When I went into making this show I came at it from the perspective that even if you didn&#39;t use Ruby you could still take away a few nuggets of info from a Rails episode since there&#39;s a lot of overlap but I&#39;m beginning to realize that&#39;s not how this works in real life.</p><p>What I&#39;m thinking now is maybe exactly what you said around being interested in Flask. You care about deploying a Flask app, not deploying in general.</p><p>You are right though, I have no problem sitting down and listening to a 5 hour conversation with John Carmack and Lex because I&#39;m interested in hearing John&#39;s stories. I&#39;m not there to learn the gory details about z-fail stencil shadows. I care about why he ended up inventing that and how it helped him build a cool looking game. When looking at things from that angle, that changes everything. Running in Production is like &#34;90% technical details / 10% story&#34; but &#34;80% stories / 20% technical details&#34; is a more enjoyable listen for a podcast. If this were a technical video course that would be much different, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a podcast.</p><p>Now to be fair, I did try the best I could to avoid going too deep into the technical details about a specific topic because I know most folks will doze off or lose interest because it&#39;s not relatable but still, bouncing around a bunch of technical topics at a surface level is still very tech heavy.

I&#39;m seeing a trend in quite a few comments that are leading me to see that the titles can be much approved upon.<p>That one does read a lot like an ad. For most titles I tried to lead with the service name plus what they do in 70 characters or less. I tried to focus more on what the service does because I figured most folks wouldn&#39;t know what these services are, but if you know what it does it might help you relate to something in your own mind based on a rough idea of &#34;this will be about an invoicing service or an email campaign service, etc.&#34;.</p><p>But, if I do step back and reflect on my own browsing habits for not just podcasts but also YouTube. It comes down to the title. Always.</p><p>It&#39;s an interesting problem in this context. The suggestions here are to mainly make the titles optimized for humans (which I agree with too), but I&#39;m not sure if that will help with gaining traction because the site is already nearly invisible on Google and podcast sites. With that said though, after 2 years and a 100 titles in their current state, my original plan is clearly not working so I have nothing to lose to switch up that strategy. Although I&#39;m not sure if I should go back and change all of the existing titles (they are also tied into the URL on a static site, etc.).

There are dates at the bottom of each episode btw. The last episode was from about a year ago.<p>Promotion wise I tried to organically promote it. Basically if I read a comment on HN or a few sub-reddits I&#39;d leave a non-spammy reply and often end the comment with something that links back to an episode with a timestamped link to the information related to the comment. I also suggested guests share the episode when it goes live. I tweeted out new episodes but I don&#39;t have a huge following.</p><p>Some of those posts on Reddit did pretty well. For example this single post in /r/django fueled almost a year&#39;s worth of guests <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/gddnh0/are_you_running_any_type_of_django_app_in/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/gddnh0/are_you_runn...</a>, and the follow up post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/ifrcd6/a_few_months_ago_i_asked_the_django_community/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/ifrcd6/a_few_months...</a>.</p><p>&gt; You suck at audio engineering. The audio from several samples I listened to ranging from mid-run to the most recent episode were a plosive and fricative nightmare.</p><p>Is this feedback mostly on the guest&#39;s audio or my set up?</p><p>It&#39;s not my full time job but remember each guest is a different person recording their side of the track in their house or office. They&#39;re using whatever bare bones mic set up they have. I pre-assembled a list of recording suggestions before the show to avoid common issues. If money were no object I&#39;d send every guest $150-200 worth of equipment or pay to have studio time in their local area so they can record their side but that&#39;s not realistic for a podcast this size.</p><p>The most recent episode has plosives but if something clips there&#39;s not much I can do since the source audio is messed up. Everyone was recording locally, usually with Audacity to eliminate any network artifacts. Audio editing wise on my side, I usually just run their track through a noise gate while trying not to kill the natural sound of their voice. Sometimes I play a little with an EQ when it&#39;s super clear they have a very trebly voice. Often times I can&#39;t use a compressor to make their volume more consistent because they have a huge amount of room noise that can&#39;t be filtered out without making them sound non-human.</p><p>I&#39;m curious what you think about this episode&#39;s quality <a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/31-mux-is-an-api-based-platform-that-lets-you-process-and-stream-videos" rel="nofollow">https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/31-mux-is-an-api-bas...</a>. This was one where the guest ended up buying a new mic before the podcast (I suggested they pick up an AT-2005 which is a pretty low cost dynamic USB mic, it&#39;s what I use as well). They wanted a better set up for future videos on their own (not just for my show). What you hear there is mostly straight from the source.

It was surprisingly good, but definitely niche.<p>The immediate things that I noticed were the audio quality, your talking speed (often slightly too fast, especially when excited), and saying &#34;like&#34; too much.</p><p>On the plus side, very in depth conversations, great guest, and you have a good interviewing voice and style IMO.</p><p>If you wanted to revive this (which I think might be worth doing), I would work on your speech and audio first. After that you&#39;ll obviously need to figure out the product aspects of this. Marketing and presentation for one. Maybe focus on bigger technologies (languages, fields, etc) for your titles and mainline questions which can bring in the views and you can get into the details and tech stacks in the summaries and long form discussions. You need for every episode to be relevant for most listeners in some meaningful way, otherwise it&#39;s pretty difficult to retain viewers. I&#39;d say most devs aren&#39;t familiar with probably the majority of episodes. Also putting video recordings on YouTube is a must. Some people want video and it&#39;s also a great marketing channel so you&#39;re limiting yourself without that.</p><p>I do think there is something there, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll stumble on to it on accident given how niche it is already - it&#39;ll require some research and trial and error.

See if you can find a way to improve your diction.<p>Another thing, in most episodes, it seems like you have a list of questions that you want to ask, and you quickly go through them, as if you just needed to check them off the list.
And I get it, any application running in production consists of multiple pieces and involves many decisions, but just listing all of the components one by one, turns into reading the specifications on the back of a cereal box.
Maybe you could pick one or two particular aspects of the infrastructure and discuss those in greater depth. Ideally something that either you or your interviewee feel very strongly about. I&#39;d also be interesting if you challenged some of the decisions that went into the infrastructure. All too often you agree too easily with your interviewee.</p><p>Overall however, none of these should be dealbreakers. I still listened to many episodes.

Using filler words is one of those things where it&#39;s easy to notice when editing or listening to it later but near impossible to notice in the middle of a regular conversation. I do try.<p>You are right. I do come into each episode with a number of high level bullets. I always try to stay on track so each episode flows roughly the same. Basically (:D) learning a bit about the service, team size, how it&#39;s built, how it&#39;s deployed and lessons learned. If some of these get skipped, it feels like an unfinished story that goes against the premise of the show? It&#39;s interesting to hear you think otherwise and would rather go deeper on a smaller subset of topics.

I kind of wonder which episodes you watched because I thought I challenged them kind of a lot but I definitely keep myself in check to avoid coming off too combative even if they are asked in a friendly way.

You have to do something special in order to get people to listen. The episode I listened to part of sounded just like it was a couple of normal devs chatting about development. Nothing wrong with that, but it&#39;s not special. If you listen to major podcasts, the people on the podcasts are highly charismatic and it&#39;s easy to listen to them talking about anything. Your podcast, on the other hand, has people who aren&#39;t particularly charismatic, just normal people talking, which I can get anywhere. Podcasts can be informative, but they are a form of entertainment, which means you have to be entertaining.<p>&#34;Devs chatting about development&#34; is also a pretty tight niche. You could probably do better than 200-300 listeners per episode, but not by much. You&#39;re creating a product very few people want. Very few people would come solely for the information being conveyed. Nothing wrong with that, but just as a podcast about European pickles would never get millions of views, no matter how good it is, neither would yours.</p><p>The audio quality was also not great, but this isn&#39;t a major issue if the podcast is entertaining.

The hard part for this style of podcast is finding a constant stream of guests. Often times you have no idea how a person is going to react on a call until you&#39;re already in the call and recording the show. In every episode we jumped on a call, spent a few minutes saying hello and went straight into it.</p><p>I went with my gut in that anyone volunteering to be on the show will be comfortable having a free form conversation. None of it is scripted but I do usually have a couple of bullet points in front of me to cover a range of general topics.</p><p>But, I get where you&#39;re coming from and I&#39;m like that too. I&#39;m for sure going to gravitate towards a more engaging host / guest if I had an option choosing between A and B. It&#39;s really hard to pull this off because if you only have guests on the show who have a public presence on the podcast / interview / YouTube / etc. scene it&#39;ll be much more difficult to find guests as a side project. You may also lose out on some really cool stories. In one episode a couple of guys built and shipped a custom hardware device to remote African villages to help make email more accessible.

I do think video adds a huge element though. It also forces me to be less perfect because it&#39;s really easy to edit audio and you as the listener would never know. Most episodes have literally hundreds of cuts but you can&#39;t tell for most of them, but video is much harder to cut since you visually see the jump cuts.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion!

I guess there are just a lot of podcasts out there and maybe it was an issue of discovery. What I listen to depends on my mood but when I was looking for a development related podcast yours was definitely one I would go to.

To me that says from a technical standpoint the show is good but you&#39;re not listening to it to be entertained specifically. You may also not be listening to it while doing something else because if technical information is what you&#39;re after, you might be focusing fully on the show?</p><p>Even if my assessment of your specific case is wrong, it got me to think about a couple of new things such as &#34;what type of mood are people in when they tune in?&#34;, &#34;are folks listening to this for pure knowledge, entertainment or something else?&#34;, and &#34;what might someone be doing while they&#39;re listening to the show?&#34;.

Niche things like this are more about _who_ is listening rather than how many people.<p>I&#39;m 100% someone interested in shows like yours, I just didn&#39;t know it existed. One major thing you could probably do right away is invite other people with followings in this area as guests. Popular podcasters are generally annoyed by requests to be on their show, but can be a lot more friendly if you invite them on yours. That&#39;s because you&#39;re doing the work and exposing them to your audience. They&#39;ll likely promote it or might even cross post it if you want to. They might have you on as a guest afterwards, someone with that many interviews is bound to have some interesting things to talk about.</p><p>The episode you posted as an example of audio quality lately seemed more than good enough for me. As far as burn out, I would maybe recommend actually doing <i>less</i> for each episode, at least until you feel like you can outsource the worst parts. What if you did only the most important parts of post, and cut down post production to an hour instead of 5 or 6? Maybe a tool that auto removes silence, umms and ahs, etc could help a bit here too. Descript for example can do a decent amount of this in about 5 minutes. Good enough in my opinion. Cut out as much post work as you can. I bet you your real audience won&#39;t care.</p><p>Part of it could also be just shorter recording times. I prefer longer episodes but it seems like I&#39;m the only one. Editing 30 mins of recording is a lot easier than an hour and a half, and people seem more likely to put on shorter episodes (I guess).</p><p>Also, just skimming a bit of an episode, I think you overdo the formality of the intro. It sounds too scripted and not like your natural self. Skipping from the intro to a later clip of you speaking, you sound much more natural later on. A lot of people will bail out during the intro if they&#39;re just checking you out for the first time and it doesn&#39;t hook them much.</p><p>The titles should reflect more of what&#39;s interesting to the audience, make it the coolest part of whatever they&#39;re doing instead of an elevator length description. Are they hitting high requests per second, doing something bleeding edge, serving a lot of users as a solo dev, etc? Combine that with the most interesting part of their stack for the title. Looking at your show notes I can see this stuff is in there, just make it the title.</p><p>If you&#39;re burning out, try being more selective with guests too. Don&#39;t force it. And don&#39;t look at it as needing X audience numbers or whatever for success. You&#39;re building authority as someone in the industry, getting respect from guests and listeners, being exposed to way more than a normal dev, and so much more. If you&#39;re trying to make a living off of the podcast, you&#39;ll need to go wayyy more generic and attention grabbing. But I say don&#39;t do that. Instead do this thing well and you&#39;ll build a name for yourself with the kinds of people who listen to things like this - people in motion, building things, who are excelling in the field. People who are or will be somebody to respect in the industry.Thats a big deal.</p><p>Finally, please keep making the show, this is a niche that I&#39;ve found surprisingly hard to find good content for. I <i>want</i> the technical details, I want the code talk and the deep dive that most podcasts cut out because &#34;people don&#39;t want to listen to this&#34;. Well, I do and so do plenty of people actually building real things.

Happy to hear you like the show.<p>I&#39;ve done a few cross-posted episodes. That wasn&#39;t the goal of those episodes but some of the episodes are with folks who either have their own podcast or are part of a group podcast. For example, the changelog episode <a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/63-changelog-is-a-news-and-podcast-platform-for-developers" rel="nofollow">https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/63-changelog-is-a-ne...</a>. There&#39;s a number of others.</p><p>I don&#39;t spend too long while editing. About 60-90 minutes of editing per episode when the episode in itself is about that long. I basically edit at 2x speed and quickly chop out the filler words. Any audio processing like cleaning up noise or basic EQ work is a few minutes. The 5-6 hours is the full end to end time from having an empty folder and no guest to a finished mp3 that&#39;s ready to be published.</p><p>The intro and outro were recorded years ago with different audio settings (it&#39;s way too muffled and bass&#39;y compared to any of the last dozens of episodes). I just pad them onto the beginning and end of each episode. They were scripted because I personally don&#39;t like long intros so I was trying to get the core essence of the show out in the least amount of time possible. I will re-record them if I pick the show back up, thanks.</p><p>Definitely going to work on the titles, at least as a homework assignment make new titles for a bunch of the previous episodes even if I don&#39;t publish them. I tried to limit each one to 70 chars or less and out of respect for the guest also wanted to include their product&#39;s name in the title.</p><p>A living would be pushing it but if you work 40-50 hours a week (which I do), dedicating nearly a full day to it is a big investment. To outsource everything properly (an editor who knows enough about the tech to pick what stays in and human vetted transcripts) would be like $300-400 per episode. That&#39;s not counting someone to go through the episodes and make clips to help promote them, that would easily be another $150-250. At 1 episode per week, even without clips that&#39;ll be ~$1,500 a month.</p><p>Getting sponsors is also tricky because it&#39;s not profitable for someone to spend $300 or even $150 per episode for an ad slot when only a few hundred people listen to it. The sponsors will only be happy if they make a return on their investment and that will require having a lot more views.</p><p>You are right though, there&#39;s a lot of ancillary benefits of having the show. That&#39;s partly why I kept going for as long as I did but I noticed that my course sales didn&#39;t really change too much during or after the podcast so I&#39;m not sure it helped get the word out on them. When I look at all of that, I think to myself that it&#39;s a failure because it didn&#39;t move the needle. The conversations were great and I value them a lot which is priceless. Although, a lot of people won&#39;t admit that money does matter. It&#39;s not my primary concern or motivation for the show but money is necessary to continue doing what you like so you can afford to continue doing it.

I really enjoy listening to your podcast, but if I may I have some feedback:<p>* Every time your guest specializes on something low-level - like Rebecca Heineman from most recent
episode, David Shayer from last year, and others - you keep saying &#34;yeah, this is a very complicated
subject and I don&#39;t understand anything about it&#34;. Everyone has they own area of expertise, no one
knows everything - and that&#39;s OK. But when you as a host constantly put yourself down, it leaves
a very strange impression on the listener: &#34;well then, invite someone who does&#34;.</p><p>* When you do a voice over for the interview and queue interviewee responses - the whole sequence feels
doctored. It just doesn&#39;t sound as a normal conversation, more like out of context clips forced into
pre-made narrative. Again, I&#39;m not saying it _is_ out of context, it just feels that way.</p><p>Please don&#39;t take these two the wrong way, you&#39;re doing great job.</p><p>Also, I would love to support the show and you seem to have a Patreon account, but prices there
are a bit too steep for a casual listener: $6/14.50/36 per month (that&#39;s in Canadian dollars).
For example, semi-weekly Darknet Diaries has $3/7.50/14.50 tiers.</p><p>In the last episode you&#39;ve announced bonus content with Rebecca, but there&#39;s not even an announcement
on the Patreon page and it&#39;s not clear what tier would allow access to it.</p><p>Sorry for the rant, but I hope it provides outside perspective and you might find it useful.

The podcast being narrative, I&#39;ve gotten complaints about the before, but my feelig is there are so many straight interview podcasts out there. If you don&#39;t like the narration then there are lots of other alternatives.</p><p>Now, it could be that I&#39;m bad at narration. That could totally be true and probably I could improve, but it&#39;s a narrative podcast.</p><p>All content is available to all patreons. Rebecca bonus episode is not out yet. I should post more details and explanation about how that works but bonus episodes episodes come out on the 15th.</p><p>Me not knowing low level stuff is true, so im not sure about that feedback. To me I think admission of my lack of knowledge in an area is good and I&#39;d like to talk about the things I don&#39;t know or my vulnerabilities more often.</p><p>Again, maybe I do it badly, but I think its good to be ok not knowing something and asking questions about it.

Youtube autoplay and recommended videos are really good for me.<p>Chat With Traders Podcast has Quant traders and software engineers from time to time. Hearing technical people talk about work and answer questions to a non-technical audience is useful, because podcasts often don&#39;t have PR talk.

The have had multiple seasons, Seasons labeled, Ad-Tech (current), Physically Distributed, k-means, Time Series, Consensus, Interpretability, Fake News, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence. I really liked the episodes I have heard so far. <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://dataskeptic.com/</a></p><p>I also enjoy old developer conference presentations like ones from Game Developers Conference and Defcon. There are projects to put saved articles through text to speech in batches on the computer, but I have set up classic TTS on my phone instead. Not all articles will work well for conversion though.

The first 20 or so episodes, they had a segment that focused on a specific programming language, the history, application and quirks which was a fun way to learn more about coding and the different tools (languages) available. They’ve since evolved to cover more practical topics such as test driven development, AI etc. it’s a good one.<p>If you’re a python fan, Talk Python To Me is a great podcast. Covers so many topics within python from libraries, frameworks and special tools.</p><p>The thing I like about these two podcasts is that they don’t assume that their listeners are primarily web developers. Since I don’t work in the web domain, it’s been tough to find a good podcasts that cover CS more broadly.
