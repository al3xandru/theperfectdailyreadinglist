In fact, as Rudolf Flesch said in his book, How To Write Speak And Think More Effectively, &#34;So here we have the secret of plain conversational talk: it is not difficult ideas expressed in easy language, it is rather abstractions embedded in small talk. It is heavy stuff packed with excelsior. If you want to be better understood you don’t have to leave out or change your important ideas; you just use more excelsior. It’s as simple as that.&#34; The point his is making that the few clear simple points can be packed with some excelsior to improve clarity.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Character limits kill creativity and complexity.<p>The presentation does leave out one very necessary requirement for becoming a good-to-great writer: you have to do a lot of reading.  If you&#39;re going to write about a complex scientific or technical subject, you should have some examples in mind of great texts that you&#39;ve read.  What did other writers do that you liked or that stuck with you?  Equally true, what are some really bad examples, some things to avoid?</p><p>For example, here&#39;s what I think is an excellent popular history book, and if I ever wrote something with a historical bent, I&#39;d flip though it first:
&#34;By Steppe, Desert, and Ocean: The Birth of Eurasia&#34; by Barry Cunliffe</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steppe-Desert-Ocean-Birth-Eurasia/dp/0199689172" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Steppe-Desert-Ocean-Birth-Eurasia/dp/...</a></p><p>The point about Twitter is really this: you have to develop the skill of composing a paragraph as a coherent entity in order to become a decent writer, and Twitter doesn&#39;t allow for paragraphs, just sentences (and short ones at that).  Paragraphs should have an internal cohesion to help the reader absorb the concept being presented.  Once you have that, you can start chaining paragraphs together, reordering the sequence of paragraphs, with the goal of constructing a path that the reader can follow through the whole essay or chapter.  Getting the order right is important for complex topics, as point D might rely on a good understanding of points A and B, and so on.  Your goal should be to make the reader feel smart.</p><p>Of course that&#39;s just advice for non-fiction writing; if you&#39;re doing fiction or poetry basically anything goes.  The public might like it or hate it, but the literary critics can safely be ignored.

I think it’s important to read a lot of different styles/genres: fiction, academic writing, journalism, old stuff, new stuff, translations, great literature in various languages, ad copy, so on. Most good writing is about conforming/mimicry and being especially considerate of the reader. Exceptional writing is a different thing. A lot of bad writing comes from regular people trying to write exceptionally. It’s hard to learn to write dumber, but thankfully the internet lets us all practice a bunch.

Getting the order right is important for complex topics, as point D might rely on a good understanding of points A and B, and so on.

I&#39;ve found that learning to write has largely a process of unlearning everything I was taught in secondary school. In school we were conditioned to excrete as much bullshit as we could in a fixed amount of time. Everything we learned--new vocabulary, literary techniques--we were told was for sounding more sophisticated, which we unknowingly interpreted as verbose. I even remember a loved English teacher saying &#34;the purpose of the first sentence in a short answer is make yourself sound smarter than you are. You shouldn&#39;t answer the question until at least the second sentence.&#34; And for some reason, every argument needed 3 supporting reasons, even though in real life there&#39;s almost always just one dominant reason.<p>Turns out actual good writing has precisely the opposite spirit. It&#39;s about compressing ideas into their simplest forms. New words are invented to make us more concise, not less. I wish I had realized this many years ago, before writing my essays for college admission.

Ahrens makes a convincing case for use of the zettlekasten, but the book is mostly about how to acquire understanding of something.

The goal isn&#39;t necessarily to archive all your knowledge, it&#39;s to facilitate insights and new ideas. In a way, having your knowledge and ideas cross referenced is just a nice side effect. Prior to reading this, I would have taken an approach that would have just been a database of things I learned, which takes a lot of time to create and doesn&#39;t do much for you in the end.</p><p>It&#39;s a short, easy read at around 150 (small) pages and the author keeps it pretty interesting. I plan on rereading it pretty soon.</p><p>edit: I forgot to add that a lot of the book goes over study methodsmost people are taught growing up, and <i>why</i> they don&#39;t really work that well. I thought this was pretty interesting as well.

They make difficult writing a long, well-structured document to record and transmit a complex idea. IM team coordination platforms are only good for the first phase of writing, that is, just getting ideas down in written format. The issue is that the tools built into those platforms do not aid in the other phases of the writing process, and in fact, they sort of make it difficult, actually. I speak from experience having to go back through thousands of Discord messages to condense the ideas into a collection of documents on different topics.<p>Someone should write an extension that makes it easier to convert IM thread to an organized document outline in slack or discord. That would be nice.

Not long ago, I kept a lengthening list of folders in my email software to track messages by topic, sender, project, urgency and any other context that seemed relevant that hour. I&#39;d spend lots of time carefully dragging and dropping every message from my inbox into the folder it seemed to belong in that day. After awhile I had so many folders the system was completely useless. Some of the folders - even after the work of creating and populating them - I barely ever opened again.</p><p>Since then I&#39;ve slimmed down my email buckets to just three: what I call the Trusted Trio. Using just a few, simple action-based folders, it takes very little thought to keep on top of my email and a consistently empty inbox.</p><p><em>Note:</em> This system is a modification of the excellent <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;http://www.macworld.com/2005/04/features/tipsinbox/index.php&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="http://www.macworld.com/2005/04/features/tipsinbox/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inbox Makeover</a></span> method published in <em>Macworld</em> in April of 2005 by king of <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;http://inboxzero.com&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="http://inboxzero.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inbox Zero</a></span> Merlin Mann. I&#39;ve been using Merlin&#39;s system since the article was published and during that time whittled my own version down from his suggested 5 to 3 folders.</p><h4 id="h545"><a id=""></a>The Trusted Trio</h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Follow Up</strong><br/> </li><li>These messages represent tasks you must complete; whether that&#39;s a response that will take more than two minutes (anything less than that, just respond on the spot!) or some sort of an action. All these messages represent an item on your to do list.</li><li>Examples of messages that might go here include: a request to update the web site, or a message from a long-lost high school friend who you haven&#39;t spoken to in years that you want to spend some time writing with updates on your life. To make sure you actually follow up on the messages in this folder, you must review it regularly. Alternately, when you add a message to this folder, make sure you <em>also</em> add it to your to-do list. Here&#39;s more on how to <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://lifehacker.com/separate-your-email-from-your-to-dos-272590&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://lifehacker.com/separate-your-email-from-your-to-dos-272590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate your email from your to-do&#39;s.</a></span></li><li><strong>Archive</strong><br/> </li><li>The Archive folder is your long-term email reference library. Place all the messages that contain information you may want to retrieve at some point in the long term future in Archive. Any completed threads, completed requests, memo&#39;s you&#39;ve read, questions you had answered, and completed project email goes into Archive. Basically, whenever an email is &#34;closed&#34; but you may find it useful at some point in the future place it in Archive.</li><li>Dumping everything directly into Archive may seem scary to dedicated filers . It was to me at first. However, the archive is your &#34;pile&#34; versus &#34;file;&#34; Just remember it&#39;s completely searchable, and any message you place there will be retrievable using a well-crafted query.</li><li><strong>Hold</strong><br/> </li><li>The Hold folder is a temporary holding pen for important messages you&#39;ll need quick access to within the next few days. If you&#39;re waiting on someone else to get back to you with crucial information, or you&#39;re maintaining a thread about a time-sensitive topic, keep it in the Hold folder. For you GTDers, items in the Hold folder might correspond with items in the next few weeks in your tickler file.</li><li>Examples of messages that would go in Hold are: a FedEx confirmation number for a delivery that&#39;s on its way, or a message from a co-worker that says, &#34;I&#39;ll get back to you Tuesday re: The Big Project.&#34;</li><li>This folder should be reviewed on a regular basis and cleared out as the message contents are no longer needed (ie, that FedEx got delivered or your co-worker gets back to you.)</li></ul><h4 id="h546"><a id=""></a>Empty your inbox</h4><p>Now that the Trusted Trio is in place, it&#39;s time to empty your inbox. Whether you&#39;re starting with an overstuffed inbox with months worth of messages or the 2 dozen that arrived since your last processing session, the method is the same. Starting with the oldest message, open it up and:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If it requires a response or action which will take less than one minute to complete, do it on the spot, then move the message to Archive.</li><li>If it requires an action on your part that will take more than one minute to complete, move it to the Follow Up folder.</li><li>If it&#39;s a piece of information or a promise you&#39;re waiting on from someone else, move it to Hold.</li><li>If it&#39;s an informational message you may want to refer to later, move it to Archive.</li><li>If it&#39;s of no use, delete it.</li></ul><p>Wash, rinse and repeat for every message in your inbox until it is completely empty.</p><h4 id="h547"><a id=""></a>Keep it empty</h4><p>Once you&#39;ve got your inbox down to zero messages, keeping it that way is a matter of repeating the process above a few times a day. Schedule times for processing email into your schedule - like once first thing in the morning, once after lunch and once in the late afternoon. Train yourself to follow the golden rule:</p><p><strong>Never leave a read email message in your inbox.</strong></p><p>Commit to making a decision about the fate of every message you read in the inbox on the spot. Whether you respond immediately or file it in Followup, Archive or Hold, never leave a message in your inbox to make room for future, incoming mail - because there will always be more.</p><h4 id="h548"><a id=""></a>The catch</h4><p>Now, just because you have all your messages filed neatly away in Followup, Archive and Hold doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re free and clear. The hard part of this system is consistently revisiting Followup and Hold and complete the &#34;open loops&#34; stowed away there. To keep yourself from getting lulled into a total sense of completeness, mark all the messages in Hold and Followup as unread so you can keep an eye on the number of outstanding items.</p><h4 id="h549"><a id=""></a>Caveat</h4><p>Of course this exact system won&#39;t work for everyone in every situation. For instance, I use a few other Lifehacker-specific labels in my LH Gmail, for instance, in addition to these three. But anytime I add a new bucket I think long and hard about it - and new additions are often temporary or saved search folders that eventually get deleted, whereas the Trusted Trio is a permanent fixture.</p><p>How do you organize your email to make sure nothing slips through the cracks?

<p>So 2023 is the year of the cloud development environment (CDE). That’s like one of the longest running jokes in tech- it’s the year of Linux on the desktop. Or maybe we’re finally approaching the time that a cloud-first developer experience (DX) becomes a normal way of working.</p>
<p>In early November GitPod took <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/future-of-software-cdes">25 million dollars in a Series A round</a> to deliver on the promise of CDEs. Tom Preston-Werner of GitHub fame led the round, and he’s someone that knows a bit about developer experience. If we look at the other investors in the round it’s impressive. The CEOs of both Shopify and Datadog, for example. And some guy called Kent Beck. These are people that understand developer-led tech adoption. GitPod is determined to make software development easier, reducing toil for developers. It’s not about the editor but the environment.</p>
<p>A week later GitHub announced that <a href="https://github.blog/2022-11-10-whats-new-with-codespaces-from-github-universe-2022/">CodeSpaces would become available for all GitHub users, with 60 hours a week free usage.</a></p>
<p>GitHub’s latest numbers are that it has 94M users. That’s a lot of potential growth for CDEs.</p>
<p>The industry continues to grapple with the challenge of local vs remote. This is not a done deal.</p>
<p>But it’s not really about online code editors, a platform idea that we have been talking about for a long time. AWS acquired Cloud9 way back in July 2016, and you’d think if anyone could make online editors a thing it would be AWS, given its scale. But developers love their MacBooks. They love high spec local performance. Latency is the enemy. They love their existing toolchains and editors. And so development stays local. So we keep arguing that “it worked on my machine”.</p>
<p>But unlike basic online editors CDEs are about creating an end to end developer experience, taking advantage of cloud technology to better integrate with code repos, build tools, databases, Kubernetes tooling and runtimes and so on. Packaging and delivering on developer workflows to offer a better experience. Repeatable, secure, automated, immutable, with no worries about drift. And aren’t industry leaders talking about testing in production now? That means developing in production. What if CDEs offered a better developer experience, and more flow – an instant on experience available to everyone.</p>
<p>The term CDE is not perfect, but will do for now. What we’re talking about are the advantages of cloud abundance and the ability to do all of these things in the cloud that make a developers’ lives easier. Making platform connections, allowing the developer to spin up containers without even thinking about it, dealing with remote APIs as first class citizens to the DX.</p>
<p>Vercel and Netlify have shown the power of understanding the components of developer workflows and assembling products accordingly. So why not apply this approach to the developer tooling itself?</p>
<p>The question of speedy local performance vs cloud power makes for unexpected competition.</p>
<p>Me, on <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips/status/1453391588919480321">Twitter, October 2021</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
So it’s basically Apple vs GitHub now, which is kind of crazy when you think about it. CodesSpaces vs M1. just when it seemed like online editing was going to kick into high gear, Apple threw down the most absurd local processing the world has ever seen. #GitHubUniverse
</p></blockquote>
<p>The ARM-based Apple architecture is so powerful and can make developers’ lives so great on their local machines that local editing and processing as the mainstay of daily work seems more sensible and likely entrenched than ever.</p>
<p>But if we think about cloud memory and compute, where builds are happening, what we’re doing with containers, and immutable architectures the direction of travel seems obvious. The real power is in the cloud. Abundance is a great opportunity to rethink how we do software development. No local machine can possibly have as much storage and compute as the public cloud. And what about APIs? It’s a constant question – how are you going to test apps that touch remote APIs? So why not just bring all of this power closer to the developer by making it available as well-packaged cloud services? And with a developer experience which is all about removing pointless busy work – task oriented end to end dev environments, ready to use on demand.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I am interested in the idea of CDEs is <a href="https://progressivedelivery.com/">Progressive Delivery</a>, which is also enabled by the cloud. Cloud abundance and routing make things like A/B testing, blue-green deployments and feature flags so much easier because we can replicate any environment without a second thought. We’re long past the era of ”oh my god, we’re going to have to spend 10 million dollars on hardware and software in order to stand up an instance of an application as I develop it, with replicated dev, test, QA and staging environments”.</p>
<p>If you can have one instance of a service, why not have five? If you can spin up one container why not spin up 10000? We can experiment with things. So Progressive Delivery has some of the same underpinnings as CDEs in terms of abundance rather than scarcity as an opportunity to rethink how developers work.</p>
<p>Another aspect of performance is of course the network, one of the constant hobbles on the idea of using a CDE. Developers always say: “But then I can’t work on a plane or when I am not in the office”. Have you checked out 5G lately? The speeds are really impressive.</p>
<p>I spoke to Johannes Landgraf, Gitpod’s CEO, about how he sees the market.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Developers will begin to change their behaviours when it becomes truly convenient for them to do. So the Figma moment will be about convenience.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And I think that’s exactly right. Convenience is the killer application. We’ve seen that in so many areas that we will always choose what is easiest. Even if it’s a little bit more expensive, it’s if it’s convenient, we’re, we’re going to use it. We’re going to like it because it’s one of our jobs to be done.</p>
<p>What Landgraf calls the Figma moment. That’s really about collaboration – 15 years ago, we might have called it the Google Docs moment. When most of us just said, “Hang on a minute, it is so much easier to collaborate with my colleagues on this platform. Why would I do anything else?” It’s a fundamentally different experience than we get from Microsoft.</p>
<p>But in DX we still haven’t had that change. Landgraf said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The industry still hasn’t had its Figma moment. How strange it is that developers moved all of their workflows to the cloud except for their own.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So for more context. We’re going to see significant investments from AWS Cloud in this space, rethinking DX for cloud services. Just today AWS at re:Invent announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/aws-application-composer-preview/#:~:text=AWS%20Application%20Composer%20helps%20developers,Composer&#39;s%20browser%2Dbased%20visual%20canvas.">Application Composer</a> (visual low code design for AWS services, essentially Stackery remade by AWS) and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-codecatalyst-preview-a-unified-software-development-service/">Code Catalyst</a> (cloud development environment, integrated with pipelines, repo-focused, issue management integration built in]. As I said on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips/status/1598370858199678978">today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span>So CodeCatalyst looks like a packaging exercise, that taps into modern developer tools, platforms and workflows. packaging wins. convenience is the killer app. it’s going to be really interesting to learn more.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve got GitHub moving forward with Codespaces, which people are now paying for in significant numbers. We’ve got Microsoft classic which actually is offering dev machines in the cloud with <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/introducing-microsoft-dev-box/ba-p/3412063">Dev Box</a>, which may not be so radical, but is going to appeal to Windows and .NET shops that want easy onboarding and security for their employees. And if we integrate Dev Box with the recently announced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview">Azure Automations</a>, we can begin to do some powerful things from a DX perspective.</p>
<p>CDE is about revolutionising how development is done and really taking advantage of cloud services and routing, rather than simply thinking about how to build a browser-based IDE. Some of the cloud services are going to be accessed by local IDEs such as JetBrains or VS Code. This is an embrace and extend play.</p>
<p>Collaboration should be so much easier. Every time we do some work, it should have a URL, the Netlify and Vercel model.That should apply to backend development as well as the front end. So whoever solves these problems for engineers and engineering managers is likely to find an open door in sales situations.</p>
<p>Landgraf explained that integration is one of the key aspects of CDEs. Thus for example, when a developer goes to their GitPod console, they should already be authenticated with PlanetScale or MongoDB. Mongo actually invested in the Series A. JFrog will also be at the developer’s fingertips.</p>
<p>CDE is a packaging exercise. As I often say – the best packager in any tech wave wins and wins big. And I think what we’re currently looking at is packaging up how developers do their work and just trying to make that really, really easy.</p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with Stephen Pousty, an old friend, and we in fact have a bet on whether this really is the year of the cloud development environment. I bet that around 25% of enterprise software development would be using CDEs within 7 years.</p>
<p>Too aggressive a timeline? Maybe. But If things flip they could flip fast.</p>
<p>I think we’re going to see a significant amount of developer work moving into these cloud environments because it doesn’t matter how good laptops are, there are ways to rethink the experience and workflow around modern software development using cloud services, integration and automation that will make developers a lot more productive. CDEs address the <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/10/06/developer-experience-gap/">Developer Experience Gap</a>, and that’s really why I think they are somewhat inevitable. That “Figma moment” we could just as easily think of in terms of the iPhone moment, which fundamentally changed the tech industry,</p>
