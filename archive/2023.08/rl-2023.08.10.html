    <p>It&#39;s been a busy week with work travel, conference talks, meetings and lots of walking. Not that I&#39;m complaining, I averaged 25k steps a day just getting around, but I am just one of those people who don&#39;t enjoy the jungle that is Las Vegas. It&#39;s nice to be home now.</p><p>While catching up through my &#34;to consume&#34; list this past week, I finally was able to watch <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org">Michael J. Fox</a> receiving the <a href="https://www.oscars.org/governors/hersholt">Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award</a> for his activism and fundraising for a cure for Parkinson&#39;s disease over the last 20 years.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKQXDve6WiE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Michael J. Fox Receives the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award | 13th Governors Awards"></iframe></figure><p>He refers to his disease as &#34;<strong>the gift that keeps on taking</strong>&#34; and in a <strong>wonderful</strong> acceptance speech, I found that his optimism, <strong>fueled by gratitude</strong>, and positivity just an incredibly inspirational way to end the week. It&#39;s also an important reminder on how you can intentionally <strong>reframe</strong> something that&#39;s going on, into a positive motivator.</p><p>We all get overloaded, stressed out, wrapped up in the trappings of day to day minutia; but <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/reframing-defined-2610419">cognitive reframing</a> can be a valuable tool in helping shifting your mindset to look at a situation, person, or struggle into a different perspective to motivate change.</p><p><strong>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy to do</strong>, but rather, it&#39;s a <strong>valuable</strong> skill to develop. We all struggle with <a href="https://makoism.com/crushing-weights/">impostor syndrome</a>, our own daemons or health issues, and most of us easily slip back into a negative mindset. Some of the hardest work is to identify negative thoughts and intercepting them; but if you can figure out how to recognize when you start down the path of negativity, you can build the muscle to create replacement thoughts.</p><p>Some quick tips that have helped me:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://makoism.com/up-is-down/">Keep a journal</a></strong>.</li><li><strong>Fact-check yourself</strong> - ask yourself &#39;is this true?&#39;; forming the habit to finding &#39;proof&#39; for a though can help shut down negative thinking.</li><li><strong>Talk to your <a href="https://makoism.com/a-personal-board-of-directors/">board of directors</a></strong>.</li><li><strong>Turn the thought into positive action</strong> - use the thought as a catalyst for a task to make yourself feel better. Challenges are opportunities.</li></ul><p>In the end, we&#39;re all spinning around on this ball through space together. Knowing that we all dealing with our own shit, perhaps makes the journey a bit easier for each one of us.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epUy2jPuVPw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Woody Harrelson Honors Michael J.

Some managers get energy from writing some software. That’s great, particularly if you avoid writing software with strict dependencies. Some managers get energy from coaching others. That’s great. Some get energy from doing exploratory work. Others get energy from optimizing existing systems. That’s great, too. Some get energy from speaking at conferences. Great. Some get energy from cleaning up internal wiki’s. You get the idea: that’s great. <strong>All these things are great, not because managers should or shouldn’t program/speak at conferences/clean up wiki’s/etc, but because folks will accomplish more <a href="https://lethain.com/time-and-energy/">if you let them do some energizing work, even if that work itself isn’t very important.</a></strong></em></blockquote><p>Lots of great food for thought in this one.</p><h2 id="thought-of-the-week">Thought of the week</h2><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There&#39;s no such thing as &#39;quality&#39; time:</p><p>Time is time.</p><p>In fact, as Jerry Seinfeld said, garbage time — eating cereal together late at night, laying around on the couch — is actually the best time.</p><p>Forget chasing HUGE experiences.</p><p>It’s all wonderful, if you so choose.</p></div>— Ryan Holiday (@RyanHoliday) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday/status/1595779312019419137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2022</a></blockquote>

Even those of us who like a good meeting have plenty of experience sitting through painful, boring, poorly-run meetings that seem to exist only to waste our time. Engineers hate meetings: they take you out of flow and (in the pre-remote days) away from your monitors so that you can listen to some manager drone on and answer a couple of questions. Pointless.</p><p id="b040">It’s not surprising that when a company takes a stand against meetings, they take a stand against big, boring meetings. Notoriously, Shopify has (more than once) cancelled all standing multi-person meetings in an effort to get rid of time wasters and give focus time back to their employees. I agree that it’s a great idea to revisit standing group meetings regularly, and get rid of the ones that are no longer serving a valuable purpose. But are the big boring standing meetings really the big problem, or are they the problem that senior managers face most often?</p><p id="b1fc">I do think there is a meetings problem, but I don’t think the problem is big boring meetings, and I certainly doubt that is the problem at a company who regularly goes through a public exercise of cancelling all standing meetings! Instead, I fear that the culprit is a surprising new factor, one that started before the pandemic but has gotten even more out of hand in the world of remote work: 1:1s.</p><h2 id="120c">One-on-one meetings are a quiet time waster</h2><p id="1842">I realized this when I asked friends why they didn’t think it was reasonable to expect line managers to write code* anymore because they were too busy. That surprised me, because how many meetings can a line manager be in? Their team, their boss’s staff meeting, some planning stuff, management 1:1s, ok. If the line manager is creating a bunch of group meetings, you should work with them to cancel the unnecessary ones before they drive their team to quit, and that would also give them time back to do some hands-on work. But the issue isn’t stand-ups, or group status meetings, or any of the other annoying project management ceremonies, as I expected. Instead, it is an overabundance of 1:1s. And this can apply not just to managers, but to Staff+ engineers as well!</p><p id="7162">What are these 1:1s all about? Well, line managers meet with their direct reports and their manager, of course <em>(do not cancel these critical 1:1 meetings!!)</em>, but also their peers, their product managers, designers, recruiting, skip level manager upwards, people from other teams who decided to reach out. Staff+ engineers might meet with all of the members of their team, other staff+ engineers, managers from other orgs, and more. These senior people also have a lot of interviews (arguably a form of 1:1 meetings, certainly not something saved by cutting out recurring group meetings). This 1:1 communication has become the de facto way for people to stay in touch, build trust, maintain alignment, and generally create a sort of eventual loose consensus about the work.</p><p id="4bb0">Now, I’m not gonna lie: to me this is ridiculously wasteful. A Staff+ engineer should not need to do weekly 1:1 meetings with every engineer on their team; as much as I agree that there is “glue” work to be done, in this case they may be falling into the trap of filling management gaps that they shouldn’t cover up. Engineering managers of peer teams only need to meet 1:1 weekly when their teams are collaborating on something critical, and otherwise should aim for a monthly-to-quarterly cadence (ok maybe you have a buddy you like catching up with weekly, but you don’t need to do this with everyone). And senior engineering managers should not overdo the skip level 1:1s to the point where they are spending half their time talking to their skips about their directs unless something is very broken in an organization.</p><p id="a09f">As a leader, abdicating the responsibility of creating productive group meetings is the worst possible outcome, because all it does is lead to the never-ending grind of 1:1 meetings that don’t accomplish as much and take up much more of your time. You are responsible for setting up well-run weekly group meetings to fill the trust and alignment gap, rather than having your broader team go through the combined number of subset 1:1 meetings. Letting topics that should be discussed as a group turn into 1:1 topics has many negative consequences, because you never deliver the message the same way twice, the time lag between talking to people leads to drama and gossip, and you miss the opportunity for the group to discuss the problem and ask questions together.</p><p id="4df1">I think this is happening because it’s easy to set up 1:1 meetings without a purpose, chat with someone for a half hour, feel good that you got some face time with them, and conclude that you’ve been productive. It’s much harder to bring a group together and run a productive meeting where you make decisions and move things forward: for one, they’re just harder to schedule, and then you actually have to prepare if you’re going to run the meeting without wasting everyone’s time. We’ve been so negative about boring group meetings that we’ve taught people to avoid them at all costs, and we’re filling the gap with inefficient 1:1s. I also think there’s a bit of a conflict-avoidance culture that these 1:1s enable; after all, was there really a conflict if you disagreed behind closed doors and then never resolved the issue?</p><p id="4c1e">If you’re still unconvinced, consider: Have you ever had to deal with the fallout of your manager thoughtlessly discussing something 1:1 with another person to a conclusion that caused you to run around and have several other conversations and meetings to resolve? This is the situation you are likely to create if you overdo the “quick” 1:1 meetings as the default communication channel. Similarly, you encourage people to make decisions in circumstances of plausible deniability, behind closed doors, by making it hard for them to have a regular forum in which to discuss things as a group. I truly cannot imagine the mental model of someone who believes that the solution to too many meetings is to cancel group meetings while leaving 1:1 meetings untouched, unless their goal is creating a kind of hyper-political anti-transparency culture.</p><p id="b872">Yes, it is true, many managers (and Staff+ engineers) have no idea how to run good group meetings, and group meetings can be much harder to run well over video than in person. It is easy to miss the subtle body language of someone who doesn’t agree but also doesn’t feel comfortable speaking up, in a group video meeting, and without practice we end up in a world where we think silence means agreement. We all need to build up better meeting execution skills whether in-person or over video, and as a senior person you should consider developing these skills a core part of your job.</p><p id="749b">So build up those skills, please. And yes, cut the pointless status update meetings where attendees show up and say at most one thing. Be thoughtful about peoples’ time, and don’t waste it; but don’t assume that a meeting is a good use of time just because it only has two participants, and watch out for replacing more-effective group communication with error-prone 1–1 time.</p><p id="0ef1"><em>Note: Seriously, this is not a call to cancel your management 1:1s (the ones with your manager and your direct reports). Those are really important, you need to do them regularly, do not cancel them because of this blog post, please!</em></p></div><div><p id="6f9b">*Ironically, people have this idea that I think engineering line managers should not ever write code. Not sure where you got that idea but in general I think it’s good if you are managing a small team to still write some (ideally not critical path) code. Caveats abound, but let’s put this idea to bed that I ever gave a blanket statement on the matter!</p></div><div><p id="532a"><em>Enjoy this post?

Let&#39;s not dismiss other&#39;s experience just because it doesn&#39;t match our own, the truth is most likely somewhere in the middle. Especially when so many people are clamoring saying that they had pain using K8s.<p>The initial deployment for EKS requires multiple plugins to get to something that is &#34;functional&#34; for most production workloads. K8s fails in spectacular ways (even using Argo, worse using Argo TBH) that require manual intervention. Local disk support for certain types of workloads is severely depressing. Helm is terrible (templating Yaml... &#39;nuff said). Security groups, IAM roles, and other cloud provider functions require deep knowledge of K8s and the cloud provider. Autoscaling using Karpenter is difficult to debug. Karpenter doesn&#39;t gracefully handle spot instance cost.</p><p>I could go on, but these are the things you will experience in the first couple days of attempting to use k8s. Overall, if you have deep knowledge of K8s, go for it, but It is not the end-all solution to Infra/container orchestration in my mind.</p><p>I fought with a workload for over a day with our K8s experts, it took me an hour to deploy it to an EC2 ASG for a temporary release while moving it back to K8s later. K8s IS difficult, and saying it&#39;s not has a lot of people questioning the space.</p><p>The way I see it is it starts off easy, and quickly ramps up to extremely complex. This should not be the case.</p><p>I worked at a company that had their own deployment infra stack and it was 1000x better than K8s. This is going to be the next step in the K8s space I believe and it may use K8s underneath the covers, but the level of abstraction for K8s is all wrong IMO and it is trying to do too much.

    ansible.builtin.group:
      name: somegroup
      gid: 2000
      state: present
  
  - name: Ensure that we have a user that belongs to the group
    ansible.builtin.user:
      name: someuser
      uid: 3000
      shell: /bin/bash
      groups: somegroup
      append: yes
      state: present
</code></pre>
This can help you setup some monitoring for the nodes themselves, install updates, mess around with any PKI stuff you need to do and so on, everything that you could achieve either manually or by some Bash scripts running through SSH. Better yet, the people who just want to run the containers won&#39;t have to think about any of this, so it ensures separation of concerns as well.<p>Deploying apps through Ansible directly can work, but most of the container orchestrators might admittedly be better suited for this, if you are okay with containerized workloads. There, they all shine: Docker Swarm, Hashicorp Nomad, Kubernetes (K3s is really great) and so on...

Yes, it means you need to pick a monitoring system. And yes, it means you need to decide a scheduling policy.</p><p>I wrote an orchestrator pre-K8S that was fewer LOC than the <i>yaml config</i> for my home test K8S cluster.

I think anyone that&#39;s been a Systems Engineer that&#39;s over 30 has probably deployed every one of these.</p><p>One thing I&#39;ve learned over my mixed SWE and SE career is that infrastructure is expensive and grows regardless of revenue. I didn&#39;t truly appreciate this until I launched Kubernetes on Digital Ocean and began running my personal cloud on it. It was costing me over $100/m for very little. That money was gone whether I pushed a ton of VPN traffic over my mesh or not. It didn&#39;t care about how much I stored in the disk I reserved, and frankly, that cost was going to grow as time went on. I pulled the plug, setup servers in my house, wired up Traefik and Docker Compose V2 with a little Tailscale sprinkled on. The servers stay up to date with some scripts, I deploy new apps on select servers with Docker Compose and Docker profiles.</p><p>It&#39;s possible for companies to do similar things, but not to the extremes I took it to. A really good infrastructure SWE generally goes for $300k. You can pay people with an expertise in these things who can streamline them and create maintainable products out of your infrastructure or you can pay for Legos and glue from a managed service provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure. At some point the latters costs will not scale, you&#39;ll pivot and cost reduce many times - maybe even begin rearchitecting. I think there&#39;s a lot of companies that are noe realizing the cheap money is gone, and the cloud has somewhat relied on cheap money.

I come from a background of running small startups on a shoe string budget. I need to make tough choices when it comes to this stuff. I can either develop features or start spending double digit percentages of my development budget on devops. So, I aim to minimize cost and time (same thing) for all of that. At the same time, I appreciate things like observable software, rapid CI/CD cycles, and generally not having a lot of snow flakes as part of my deployment architecture. I actually have worked with a lot of really competent people over the past two decades and I like to think I&#39;m not a complete noob on this front. In other words, I&#39;m not a naive idiot but actually capable of making some informed choices here.<p>That has lead me down a path of making very consistent choices over the years:</p><p>1) no kubernetes and no microservices. Microservices are Conways Law mapped to your deployment architecture. You don&#39;t need that if you do monoliths. And if you have a monolith, kubernetes is a waste of CPU, Memory, and development time. Complete overkill with zero added value.</p><p>2) the optimal size of a monolith deployment is 2 cheap VMs and a load balancer. You can run that for tens of dollars in most popular cloud environments. Good enough for zero down time deployments and having failover across availability zones. And you can scale it easily if needed (add more vms, bigger vms, etc.).</p><p>3) those two vms must not be snow flakes and be replaceable without fanfare, ceremony, or any manual intervention. So use docker and docker-compose on a generic linux host, preferably of the managed variety.  Most developers can do a simple Dockerfile and wing it with docker-compose. It&#39;s not that hard. And it makes CI/CD really straight forward. Put the thing in the container registry, run the thing. Use something like Github actions to automate. Cheap and easy.</p><p>4) Use hosted/managed middleware (databases, search clusters, queues, etc). Running that stuff in some DIY setup is rarely worth the development time and operational overhead (devops, monitoring, backups, upgrades, etc). All this overhead rapidly adds up to costing more than years of paying for a managed solution. If you think in hours and market conform rates for people even capable of doing this stuff, that is. Provision the thing, use the thing, and pay tens of dollars per month for it. Absolute no brainer. When you hit thousands per month, you might dedicate some human resources to figuring out something cheaper.</p><p>5) Automate things that you do often. Don&#39;t automate things that you only do once (like creating a production environment). Congratulations, you just removed the need for having people do anything with teraform, cloudformation, chef, puppet, ansible, etc. Hiring people that can do those things is really expensive. And even though I can do all of those, it&#39;s literally not worth my time. Document it, but don&#39;t automate it unless you really need to and spend your money on feature development.</p><p>But when I need to choose between hiring 1 extra developer or paying similarly expensive hosting bills, I&#39;ll prefer to have the extra developer on my team. Every time. Hosting bills can be an order of magnitude cheaper than a single developer on a monthly basis if you do it properly. For reference, we pay around 400/month for our production environment. That&#39;s in Google cloud and with an Elastic Cloud search cluster included.</p><p>Other companies make other choices of course for all sorts of valid reasons. But these work fine for me and I feel good about the trade offs.

I think system design interviews are partly to blame because they select for people who think that the only way to design a system is the cargo cult method that interview prep books and courses preach, which is:<p>- break everything into microservices</p><p>- have a separate horizontally scalable layer for load balancing, caching, stateless application server, database servers, monitoring/metrics, for each microservice.</p><p>- use at least two different types of databases because it&#39;s <i>haram</i> to store key-value data in a RDBMS</p><p>- sprinkle in message-passing queues and dead-letter queues between every layer because every time you break one system into two, there can be a scenario where one part is down but the other is up</p><p>- replicate that in 10 different datacenters because I&#39;ll be damned if a user in New York needs to talk to a server in Dallas</p><p>And all this for a service that will see at most 10k transactions per second. In other words, something that a single high-end laptop can handle.</p><p>99.9% of the time your architecture does NOT need to look like Facebook&#39;s or Google&#39;s. 99% of tech startups (including some unicorns) can run their entire product out of a couple of good baremetals. Stop selecting for people who have no grounding of what is normal complexity for some given scale.

I&#39;m currently working at the opposite of a startup with a shoestring budget. We&#39;re a medium-sized company with 100 - 150 techies in there. As a unique problem, we&#39;re dealing with a bunch of rather sensitive data - financial data, HR data, forecast and planning data. Our customers are big companies, and they are careful with this data. As such, we&#39;re forced to self-host a large amount of our infrastructure, because this turns from a stupid decision into a unique selling point in that space.<p>From there, we have about 7 - 12 of those techies working either in my team, saas operations, our hardware ops team, or a general support team for CI/images/deployment/buildserver things. 5 - 10% of the manpower goes there, pretty much.</p><p>The interesting thing is: Your perspective is our dream vision for teams running on our infrastructure.</p><p>Like - 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3: Ideally, you as the development team shouldn&#39;t have to care about the infrastructure that much. Grab the container image build templates and guidelines for your language, put them into the template nomad job for your stuff, add the template pipeline into your repository, end up with CD to the test environment. Add 2-3 more pipelines, production deployments works.</p><p>These default setups do have a half life. They will fail eventually with enough load and complexity coming in from a product. But that&#39;s a &#34;succeed too hard&#34; kinda issue. &#34;Oh no, my deployment isn&#39;t smooth enough for all the customer queries making me money. What a bother&#34; And honestly, for 90% of the products not blazing trails, we have seem most problems so we can help them fix their stuff with little effort to them.</p><p>4 - We very much want to standardize and normalize things onto simple shared services, in order to both simplify the stuff teams have to worry about and also to strengthen teams against pushy customers. A maintained, tuned, highly available postgres is just a ticket, documented integrations and a few days of wait away and if customers are being pushy about the nonfunctional requirements, give them our guarantees and then send them to us.

  2) entropy *always* increases (RAM usage, memory corruption, hardware issues, OS misconfiguration etc.) so eventually the application will break and stop serving traffic until it&#39;s repaired/restarted (which can take time if it&#39;s a hardware issue)

  3) deployments are tricky if there&#39;s nothing before the executable (stop, update, restart =&gt; downtime)

  4) if cache is in-process, on a restart it will have to be repopulated from scratch, leading to temporary slowdowns (+ and maybe a thundering herd problem) which will happen *every time* you deploy an update

I think much of it is ignoreable if the site is just a personal blog or a static site. But if the site is a real time &#34;web application&#34; which people rely on for work, then you still need:<pre><code>  1) some kind of containerization, to deal with inevitable entropy (when a container is restarted, everything is back to the initial clean state)

  2) at least two instances of the application: one instance crashes =&gt; the second one picks up traffic; or during rolling updates: while one instance is being killed and replaced with a new version, traffic is routed to another instance

  3) persistent data (and sometimes caches) need to be replicated (and backed up) -- we&#39;ve had many hardware issues corrupting DBs

  4) automatic failover to a different machine in case the machine is dead beyond repair

&gt;not some external monster tool like k8s<p>What can you use instead of k8s for this kind of scenario? (an ultra reliable setup which doesn&#39;t need a whole cluster)

And even then, two identical boxes (instead of binpacking into a cluster, increasing failure probability) go a very long way.<p>It&#39;s a vicious circle. We build distributed multi-node systems, overlay software-configured networks, self-healing clusters, separate distributed control planes, split everything into microservices, but it all makes systems <i>more</i> fragile unless enough effort is spent on supporting all that infrastructure. Google might not have a choice to scale vertically, but the overwhelming majority of companies do. Hell, even StackOverflow still scales vertically after all these years! I know startups with no customers who use more servers than StackOverflow does.

Many bugs are pretty rare bugs which are triggered only under specific conditions (a user, or the system, must do X, Y, Z at the right moment). So it doesn&#39;t happen all the time. But when it happens, the whole server crashes or starts behaving in a funky way and other users are affected. Sure you may say if it&#39;s a rare bug, then users will be rarely affected. But we don&#39;t have a single bug like that, there&#39;s always N such bugs lurking around (we never know how many of them in a large application); multiply it by N bugs and you have server crashes for different reasons quite often, making your paying customers dissatisfied. It also assumes you can fix such a bug immediately while it&#39;s not always true, there&#39;s often Heisenbugs it takes weeks to root out and fix, while your customers are affected (sure the application will restart but ALL users (not just the one who triggered the bug) can loose work, get random errors when the app is not available -- not a good experience). So having several app instances for backup allows to soften such blows, because there will always be at least one app instance which is available.</p><p>&gt;Entropy increases with complex setup. The whole point of not having a complex setup is to reduce entropy and make the system as whole more predictable</p><p>I agree that entropy increases with complex setup, but there&#39;s also base entropy which accumulates simply because of time (which I think is more dangerous). Like make a sufficient number of changes to the setup of your application (which you often need if you release often) and eventually someone or something somewhere will make a mistake or expose a bug somewhere, and you will need to repair it and you won&#39;t be able do it easily because your setup is not containerized which would allow to return to the clean state quite easily with no effort. We&#39;ve had issues like that with our non-containerized deployments and it&#39;s a very complex and error-prone undertaking to do it flawlessly (no downtime or regressions) compared to containerized deployments.</p><p>&gt;Plus modern CPUs are incredibly fast and can process several GBs of data per second. Even in the worst cases, you should be able to rebuild all your caches in a second</p><p>Hm, usually caches are placed in front of disk-based DB&#39;s to speed up I/O, i.e. it&#39;s not a matter of slow CPU&#39;s, it&#39;s a matter of slow I/O. Rebuilding everything which is in the caches from DB sources is not super fast.

It can scale when clusters and blast radius is small but can be complicated when it involves contributions from n teams.
For this reason when we were managing our own k8s cluster on prem, we were using kubespray which worked but upgrades were a multiple hours affair.

The two are connected. The entire premise is that it should be a set of portable conventions. I can run things on my laptop or desktop or raspberry pi or $10/mo budget VPS or GCP or AWS or Azure or Linode or god willing a bunch of bare-metal in a colo. It&#39;s fundamentally a powerful abstraction. In isolation it makes little sense, which TFA handedly demonstrates. If you eschew the conventions, it&#39;s not like the problems go away.

BUT it is true that all the multi region/AZ guarantees + logs + dashboards + network services @ AWS costs tend to skyrocket in a couple of years.
And here is where k8s really shines, in my opinion: allowing you to abstract your deployment away from a cloud even on cheap hosting.

The inherent complexity hides behind layers of iterative, mutating actions where any one step seems &#34;simple&#34;, but the whole increasingly gets lost in the entropic background, and in the end the system gets more and more difficult to _actually_ understand and reproduce.</p><p>Tools like ansible and terraform and kubernetes have been attempts to get towards more definition, better consistency, _away_ from the imperative. Even though an individual step under the hood may be imperative, the goal is always toward eventual consistency, which, really only kubernetes truly achieves.  By contrast, MRSK feels to be subtly turning that arrow around in the wrong direction.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it was fun to build, but one could have spent 1% of that time getting to understand the &#34;complexity&#34; of kubernetes - by the way, which quickly disappears once it&#39;s understood.

That Vault is a first-class citizen of K8s and a red-headed-stepchild of Nomad is another.<p>I do agree about Helm tho, I avoid it as much as possible.

Just follow the basic tutorials to set k8s up, and hope you don&#39;t end up sitting up all night with a site that&#39;s refusing connections while your customers flee.</p><p>The first one is the only responsible choice but it&#39;s going to add another half million to your cash burn, and that&#39;s on top of the high-margin &#34;managed&#34; service cloud bills like RDS.</p><p>So I can see why people are drawn to a system where instead of paying for k8s and &#34;Postgres in a box&#34; they can pay for a simple server and have simple tooling to deploy, back up, etc.

You cannot limit them to X bytes.  So, if you give a single service a volume, it might just take the whole disk.  Well, technically, it might just take the whole filesystem, which, if you have multiple disks used by a single filesytem, will mean it&#39;ll take all of them.<p>Obviously, you cannot move local volumes around.</p><p>And if you are setting up a database in Kubernetes... oh, you are in such a pit of troubles, that dealing with local volumes isn&#39;t really even worth mentioning.  Surprisingly, your problems don&#39;t even start with storage, they start with memory.  Databases really like memory, but use it very opportunistically, and scale well with load.  So, when you configure your database, you tend to give them all the memory you have, but when they use it, it will really depend on the load and the kind of queries, how well they optimize it.  Since Kubernetes scheduler doesn&#39;t really do well with reservations, you may run into situations where your database OOMs or just slows everything down, or doesn&#39;t perform well at all...</p><p>Next comes fsync.  Unlike many unsophisticated applications, databases don&#39;t like losing data.  That&#39;s why they want to use fsync in some capacity.  But this creates problems sharing resources, again, well beyond anything Kubernetes can help with.</p><p>Next comes provisioning of high-quality storage for databases... and storage likes to come in the form of a device, not filesystem, but Kubernetes doesn&#39;t know how to deal with devices, so, it needs a help from CSIs of all sorts to do that, and depending on technology you choose, you&#39;ll have a very immersive journey into the world of hacks and muti-thousand page protocol descriptions telling you how to connect your storage and Kubernetes.</p><p>It might appear though, at the first glance, that things work well w/o much intervention, and there&#39;s a Helm chart for this or the other provider, and it&#39;s all at the tips of your fingers... but, as it often is in the world of storage, things get extremely complicated extremely quickly in case of errors.  In such situations, Kubernetes will only obscure the problem.  Oh, and errors in storage don&#39;t usually happen in the next hour or day or even year after you&#39;ve set it up.  It hits you few years later, once you&#39;ve accumulated a ton of useful data and you&#39;ve entirely forgotten how things have been set up, and folks in Kubernetes had moved on and broke stuff.</p><p>---</p><p>So, not only do you need small scale, you also need a very short temporal scale: don&#39;t expect your Kubernetes cluster to work well after about a year of being deployed. Probably not at all after five years.</p><p>But then... if it only works at small scale and for short time? -- is it really worth the trouble? I mean, Kubernetes isn&#39;t a small thing, it takes away a big constant share of your resources, which it promises to amortize with scale.  You are essentially preaching the same idea as Electron-based desktop applications or Docker containers that create a lot of duplication of entire Linux user-space + a bunch of common libraries if you aren&#39;t extremely careful with that. Doesn&#39;t it become an argument for producing hot garbage as fast as possible so that someone else who can do a better job won&#39;t get a chance of selling their goods because they didn&#39;t have time to deliver?

There was nothing forcing 37signals back in 2004 to roll their own framework in order to support developing their apps, but they did anyway.<p>And for every Rails out there, there are thousands of internal frameworks with big ambitions that just turned out to be inferior to what&#39;s already available. You just can&#39;t know it when you start developing. It takes a bit of ego and ambition to go that path, but sometimes it pays off. And my guess is that if it paid off in the past, you&#39;re more likely to try it again.
