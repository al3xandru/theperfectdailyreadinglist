	    	    				    		      	    	<p>Even if you have been posting on your own site for quite some time, blogging regularly can still be challenging. Ask almost anyone who blogs and they will probably tell you the same: They would very much like to hit that publish button more often, but, somehow, it just doesn’t happen. One reason for that can be that we feel like every post has to be perfect, so we start fiddling with our text longer and longer. Another reason could be that we don’t find the time to write more often between everything else that is going on in our lives. And then, there are all the things related to writing itself that can hold us back, like finding something to write about in the first place, structuring our writing, editing the posts, and so on. And, just like with other habits, once you let the series break and more and more time has passed since your last post, it is getting even harder to publish again.</p>

<p>Here is a thought. Maybe, we are overthinking it. Maybe, the one thing we should care most about is just putting stuff out there. At least, this is the primary reason we have a personal website, right? We have it to document and share random thoughts, things we learned, and nuggets we found. If we don’t put stuff out there, why have a website in the first place?</p>

<p>When I think of people who publish regularly, three come to mind immediately. For one, there is <a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a>, of course, who has been publishing a blog post every single day since 1548 or so. <a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a> is another avid writer and a busy bee when it comes to posting all kinds of thoughts and links on this website – which really feels like an extension of his mind. But the guy who is the primary reason I sat down to write the post you are reading is <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a>. Chris, who recently sold his blog <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> to Digital Ocean, is now posting <em>a lot</em> on his personal site again, and it’s so inspiring and refreshing to see how he approaches it. Some posts are longer while others are short. There are a lot of posts about the Web and web technology, of course, but there are also others about <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/30/isnt-being-fat-just-unhealthy/">health</a>, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/03/weber/">mandolins</a>, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/19/%e2%9c%8d%ef%b8%8f-%e2%9b%b8-%f0%9f%91%80/">writing</a>, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/06/who-do-you-want-your-teacher-to-be/">teaching</a>, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/01/identifying-plants-is-built-into-ios/">identifying plants</a>, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/13/things-papyrus-is-used-for/">good typography</a>, and collections of random thoughts. It really feels like a personal site that is there for a reason.</p>

<p>So how do they do it? Do they sit down at their desk – very consciously – and take the time to write? You better believe they do. Do they write without worrying too much about what others might think or how polished their posts are? For sure. But, more importantly, it looks like they are enjoying the process of creating and have found a way to make publishing easy for them. And those two things might really be the key to publishing more often: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enjoy the practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it as convenient and comfortable as possible to publish.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, there’s only one thing left to do to just put stuff out there. </p>

<p>Don’t overthink it – hit publish.</p>

Do that every day? It feels patronizing and seems like just a way to distract myself. Might as well spend my time playing Factorio, it&#39;ll distract me as much.</p><p>I hope there is some crucial factor that I don&#39;t understand yet, and that someone will explain it to me in a reply. Otherwise, seeing the overwhelmingly positive reaction to such bullsh-t makes me feel like this whole place is fake.</p><p>---</p><p>Due to the negative tone of the above comment, I feel I should point out that it is a criticism of (or attempt to understand better) the <i>concept</i>, not the website itself. The website was very smooth and easy to work through, the author must have put a lot of effort into making it. Kudos, and if it helps people, that&#39;s a good thing regardless of my opinion and understanding (or lack thereof).

Often that means lessening the burden of the emotion because you realize it&#39;s &#34;just X&#34;.</p><p>For example, a couple of years ago I started to have panic attacks when ruminating about weird things like the infinite vacuum of space, the simulation hypothesis, the nature of sensory signals, etc. Then I thought about why I would get scared and how I felt that fear, and realized it was because I was scared of being disconnected - essentially afraid of being alone. I recognize that as the true fear, and it&#39;s a lot easier to manage than &#34;nothing is real and nothing makes sense&#34;, which is essentially just my imagination extending that base fear.</p><p>Of course the truth is that the pandemic era caused a lot of alienation, created deeper political and cultural rifts, and destabilized the entire world. That&#39;s my actual situation, so it&#39;s no wonder I feel that way, and I can address it however I see fit.</p><p>It&#39;s a way to ground yourself and break out of things that hold you back mentally.

A person having to hustle with two jobs because that’s the only way that she can afford child care or to pay down student debt doesn’t get much help from being told: “you’re sad because you’re being materially exploited”.<p>There’s almost nothing that that person can do to improve her situation in the near term. As such, many of those people deliberately choose to ignore said material realities. The great lines from Pulp’s “Common people” are an example of this attitude:</p><p>&gt; You&#39;ll never watch your life slide out of view</p><p>&gt; And you dance and drink and screw</p><p>&gt; Because there&#39;s nothing else to do

That&#39;s first-order emotional suffering.</p><p>Then there are the emotional pathologies that develop on top of that, the second-order emotional suffering, and that can be treated by therapy. For example, if you&#39;re miserable because you&#39;re poor, therapy won&#39;t help solve the anguish and stress of making rent, but it can solve second-order emotions like feelings of shame and self-hatred. Or if you have a life altering accident, it won&#39;t solve the baseline misery dealt by the terrible life consequences, but it can help with the residual panic attacks from the trauma of the accident.

I was poor growing up by American standards, and that is a different bar.</p><p>I’m curious about your take on this - 
Someone being able to enjoy their kids growing up, or see the value they bring to the people in their lives, or feel the importance in their role in keeping everyone alive, is a large part of my definition of happiness. It goes more towards ‘contentment’? Or purpose.</p><p>It includes processing the hard things, and finding the value in getting through them too, and the feeling of being good at what someone does and who they are.</p><p>For others, their definition of happy is the excited state of enjoyment (laughing, glee, etc).</p><p>For most, it’s a mix of the two.</p><p>Near as I can tell, getting rich often requires a significant degree of not being reasonable or content with the status quo. Sometimes ‘getting rich’ here is more about not being poor. Sometimes, it can be ‘there is never enough’.</p><p>Being content for someone in that state can happen of course, and after someone gets to a certain degree of wealth, tools to make it easier to get or maintain it are more readily available, but so are tools to hurt oneself.  I’ve seen a lot of people hurt themselves on this front over the years.</p><p>A lot of the contentment elements here are also quite difficult to feel productively  for someone with material wealth.  Mucking out a chicken coop because it’s nasty and you need healthy chickens to survive is a very concrete thing with a clear chain from ‘problem’ to ‘solved’.</p><p>Trying to get Alpha out of stocks is not.

So you develop a coping mechanism that, temporarily, is better than not coping with the situation you&#39;re in, but as either the situation changes or becomes long-term, it ends up disrupting your ability to engage in higher-order functioning or pursue &#34;happiness&#34; or &#34;meaning&#34; in your life.<p>The fact that stuff happens in life that makes you suffer is something you generally learn to deal with early on, and most people can handle a bit of suffering, but where things get challenging is when the &#34;second order&#34; stuff stops you from being able to see the <i>goal</i> you&#39;re shooting for, the light at the end what makes the suffering something you were able to tolerate.

But it&#39;s a crutch on par with alcohol for me. I tend to binge when bored or unhappy. I&#39;d encourage you to find other ways to deal with whatever it is you&#39;re distracting yourself from. Using tools like the above, or meditation, can help you confront and neutralize it.

By forcing yourself to study it, you need to step outside of its bounds, separating the <i>you</i> from the emotion itself. That distance you have created and held for a few moments is a welcome relief and often makes it apparent that you are a separate entity from your pain. The further away you are from it, the less painful it is. And the more you look at it, the weaker it seems. At the end of the exercise you are more aware that whatever tormenting you was just a fleeting moment with little power over you.</p><p>I find it is a brilliant and incredibly powerful concept to internalise. You can find this is the exact idea expressed in stuff like Dune&#39;s Litany Against Fear (by reciting it, you are visualizing your fear as a third party, outside of you), or meditation (remaining a passive observer to your thoughts)

I am much more aware of my posture and breathing for years of running, yoga and weightlifting. Even though I do far less of all of those than I did before I had children I know my body much better now than I did at 20. Some people need equivalent things for emotions.

It&#39;s from _Your Resonant Self_ by Sarah Peyton. Warning, it&#39;s self-helpy, yup.<p>It&#39;s interesting to me that you think focusing on your emotions might be a way to distract ourselves, it makes me curious about distract ourselves from <i>what</i>? I think some people find they actually spend a lot of time distracting themselves from their emotions, so naming and describing and locating their emotions is kind of the opposite of distracting themselves. (But distracting yourself can be a fine thing and useful coping mechanism too; in fact Peyton includes &#34;distraction&#34; as a method of &#34;self-regulation&#34; in the same section on &#34;self-regulation&#34; I&#39;m about to quote from. but, I think, a different thing than naming emotions).</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m no expert and I&#39;m not trying to convince you, if it&#39;s not something that seems to resonate with you, then maybe it&#39;s not for you, right now anyway. But since you asked, I figured I&#39;d post an excerpt from the thing I was just reading that touched on what you are asking about, in a way that really struck me -- although I don&#39;t know if just these few paragraphs will be as striking as the whole book so far as been on me!</p><p>&gt; If you have doubts that talking about feelings will help you, you are in good company. Research shows that most people don&#39;t believe that putting words to emotions helps at all. People don&#39;t think that it makes things better to name what&#39;s happening, even though the effectiveness of that approach can be seen with fMRI. Perhaps this is because many people cope by paying no attention to their emotions or their bodies and the naming of feelings is unfamiliar and thus uncomfortable. But the experience of naming what is happening not only works to calm us down; when it is done with a caring other it can also create relationships of warmth and trust, no matter how old we are. Bringing these relationships inside (importing them into our own brain and carrying them there as a memory) helps people feel more secure in the world. This can have unexpected long-term benefits, including improving immune system function; the sense of meaning and purpose in life; resiliency in the face of trauma, depression or posttraumatic stress; and relationships with others and with ourselves…</p><p>&gt; …Putting words to inner experience is helpful in another way, too. When people can&#39;t read the messages being sent by the body, they are in what scientists call alexithymia, or body blindness. Did you ever meet anyone who was stressed out and angry but didn&#39;t seem to realize it? They might not even have known that they had an increased heart rate or tension in their belly or that their eyebrows were pulling together. These people have a hard time knowing what their emotions are, let alone being able to talk about them. When people don&#39;t know what they are feeling, there&#39;s nothing they can do to remedy the situation. People who are body-blind show increased stress on their immune system and have a harder time with their relationships. There is also a link between being body-blind and being depressed. These people also suffer more from posttraumatic stress, and some research even shows that they have shorter lives.</p><p>&gt; To sum up, developing a conscious practice of naming emotions is one of the sweeteest and most counterintuitive forms of self-regulation (in which the brain takes care of itself without accessing external behaviors or substances, as opposed to self-management, which uses work-arounds such as addictions). When naming emotions is done with warmth, it can foster the mothering relationship between the prefrontal cortex  and the amygdala that securely attached children receive from their childhoods. Happily, as people start to name what is happening, they can learn to accompany themselves through emotional experience and support themselves and their immune systems while doing so.

I would describe myself as <i>extremely</i> cynical, would you? Do you feel similarly about the following? I do / did:<p>1. Mindfulness</p><p>2. Religion</p><p>3. White lies</p><p>4. Meditation</p><p>5. Astrology</p><p>6. ENTP whatever that pop psych test is</p><p>7. Sharing feelings</p><p>8. Psychology</p><p>9. Being very supportive of someone making obvious mistakes</p><p>10. Description placards on abstract art</p><p>11. Professionalism</p><p>12. Using the word &#34;spaces&#34; i.e. &#34;creating spaces for contemplation&#34;</p><p>This is just me thinking out loud, not necessarily describing you here, but I&#39;ve noticed that I myself share a sort of way of thinking with the 4chan / net-present crowd I grew up with. I&#39;m not sure if our personalities drew us to similar places on the internet, or if we were sort of fostered into a similar set of personalities because of the nature of these environments and cultures.</p><p>My best effort to define this vague sort of culture / personality / ideology is a sort of radical valuing of the truth, and seeking truth in all things.</p><p>&gt; Sure it&#39;s rude to call him fat, but if I was fat I&#39;d want someone to tell me, how are we supposed to get better if we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with us?</p><p>&gt; Depression is bullshit, everyone feels sad, you&#39;re gonna pay a psychologist 200 bucks an hour to tell you that? Life sucks, so it goes</p><p>&gt; Yeaaah I&#39;m not going to &#34;talk about my feelings,&#34; that sounds like a waste of time, let&#39;s just go do xyz instead</p><p>I would feel angry if someone suggested meditation. What a fucking joke, sitting around doing nothing for 8 minutes to an hour? Come on. I would see people being really supportive and roll my eyes. &#34;Yeah right, secretly they hate eachother / judge eachother. Take food away from both of them for just two days and watch how quickly they&#39;ll stab eachother in the back.&#34;</p><p>Again, this is not me describing you, your comment just happened to remind me of how I used to be. Looking back, I don&#39;t understand why I was so full of hate, judgement, and arrogance. I really believed that the happy people HAD to be lying about it, because I wasn&#39;t happy. I really believed everyone was secretly judging eachother, cause that&#39;s what I was doing. I really believed that various psychological techniques just had to be total bullshit, because I never genuinely tried them in good faith, and just assumed they were konk science.</p><p>I learned over time that being aware of my feelings was important and difficult, and that the various strategies I assumed were bullshit (like the ones in this post) actually can be interesting and effective ways to learn more about myself, if I set aside my anger, hatred, judgement, and genuinely tried them. I realized I was carrying a LOT of anger around, some of it directed at me for having insanely high standards for myself, my morals and values, and my failure to live those standards out perfectly, a lot of it directed outwards at other people for not being the way I thought people should be.</p><p>Regardless, activities like this, silly though they may be, were all tools in a toolbelt of self discovery. As a general rule I&#39;ve learned that new skills and experiences are earned through discomfort or suffering of some kind, and thus naturally to develop myself, my Mind, my personality, I had to suffer through some stuff I really thought was just so stupid, and some of it I still do, but I try to keep an open mind and do genuinely find myself surprised at what I learn when trying these things out.</p><p>If I stop assuming I already have all the answers and give an earnest and good faith try to some of this stuff, I learn. That&#39;s basically the TLDR.

Since last night been chewing on a blog post on the idea.<p>The long work was I read a lot of philosophy and talked to a lot of people, but there&#39;s two critical things I think caused me to dramatically shift my direction and perspective: first, I read &#34;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#34; by Dale Carnegie. It was a good first start to an open mind because his writing style is something I&#39;d put on the list above, but, I was convinced by his research and experience that what he was writing about in terms of managing human relationships was effective, and I wanted to be effective, so I resolved to grit my teeth and try his ideas. They primarily resolved around empathy and letting go of pride, so the behavior necessary was the opposite of my running theory of how to live.</p><p>Second was I started dating a girl that was also basically the opposite of my personality and some of my interpersonal values. She was basically the nicest person at my university, the least selfish person still that I&#39;ve ever met, and because we were dating I got to see again and again that nope, it really was genuine, she really did just feel and act that way. I&#39;d interrogate her about it and she&#39;d put up with it, telling me she didn&#39;t really have an ulterior motive, she just felt that&#39;s how she wanted to behave. Likely because of how she behaved she was by far and away one of the most well known people in our slice of university life and enormously successful in all things she did, and last I heard that continues in her current life somewhere buried inside the USA government. Thinking on this, my experience with her could probably be replicated by finding someone suspiciously selfless and trying to talk to them about it, maybe befriend them.</p><p>I was ambitious and had high standards for myself so I thought ok, apparently high empathy, selfless strategies get phenomenal results, I wanna be a Big Successful Business Guy, I need to try this, even if I&#39;m faking it. But faking putting yourself in someone else&#39;s shoes is just putting yourself in someone else&#39;s shoes. I found myself very very slowly saying yes to more things, sometimes because I was being a sly little experimenter in the project, sometimes just surprising myself with a new interest.</p><p>The more stuff I tried the more stuff I found to be effective at achieving things for myself. Meditation, for example. I tried it enough to learn about it, then one night out in a field at my friend&#39;s ranch when we were all laying about looking at the starts I did the breathing technique someone had shown me and went through the exercise, and never again have I been as relaxed or calm as i was that night. So that&#39;s a good feeling, that I enjoyed, and forced me to recognize that meditation can be a good thing.</p><p>That superdense period of personal epoch shifting was basically all of college, 4 years. There were some stunts abroad, including a year after college where my ugly personality caused me to tremendously fail at a job I was brought out to Taiwan for, that probably contributed a lot to the journey.</p><p>Since the &#34;unlocking&#34; of empathy it&#39;s just been more and more times where when I bother to learn someone&#39;s perspective and feelings, I&#39;m finding myself understand and emphathising (&#34;I&#39;ve felt that&#34;) or at least sympathizing (&#34;I haven&#39;t felt that but I can understand why in that situation someone might&#34;). So it&#39;s been a journey now of I guess nearly ten years.</p><p>Now I&#39;ve read a great deal of philosophy and participated in some direct action and have a logical and ethical basis for living this way and thinking this way. I feel as strongly on the side of empathy now as I previously thought it was bullshit, but I&#39;m happy I&#39;m a skeptical person because my position was hard-fought, 
and I can be confident in the basis for it (using logic, deduction, evidence, etc). Skepticism isn&#39;t inherently bad, it just means you need some convincing, and imo that can be good because it can lead to better formed, more well researched, more effective positions.</p><p>Btw the other poster said drugs so just throwing it out there that I&#39;ve never done anything more than some weed and alcohol so don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for changing ones fundamental perspective, though, I have heard plenty of similar stories about this, particular regarding shrooms.</p><p>Edit: now I&#39;m thinking on it more and I also feel like just not being surrounded by people who are all reinforcing this depressive skepticism was probably important. Like on 4chan if you dared show hope or be happy you&#39;d be mocked relentlessly. The attitude had to be aloof and mercilessly aggrandizing or you wouldn&#39;t survive. It was similar in my friend group before college. We told each other we were toughening each other up, and I don&#39;t regret it because I&#39;ve been able to transform it into a healthy way of not taking myself too seriously.</p><p>But anyway by being with people with whom I can actually have these conversations without being mocked, it makes a difference. Note here that we&#39;re getting a generally positive reaction to sharing our thoughts. If we were being downvoted and mocked, there&#39;d be no room for learning or change.</p><p>Back in college the force of my skeptical personality was likely so strong that even empathetic people would probably be forced to react with caution to avoid pain from my lashing out at them. Barriers go up when you&#39;re hella toxic. I&#39;m chewing on the idea.

There can be very good reasons that people have turned off the part of their brain that tells them about their body&#39;s emotional response to the world. If a person&#39;s skull-brain has no way to respond to messages from the body-brain (for example, if the burning, bubbling, cramping, twisting sensations that come with intense emotions have never been acknowledged, or if every one of these unchanging sensations feels like a driving hunger or a craving for an addictive substance), then a person may need to learn to ignore the body-brain. In other words, if emotions are an unbearable trip to unrecoverable emotional hell, then turning off body sensations can help people manage their world. It can be a solid survival strategy to have no idea what is happening in the body. Connection with the body can be unendurable. So it is important to take this journey slowly and acknolwedge that reading about this information may seem simple and unemotional but can awaken old trauma and restimulate old pain.</p><p>&gt; If you find this to be true for you, slow down. If we move slowly enough, we can simultaneously build a capacity for resonant, calming response at the same time that we awaken the voice of the body.

When that doesn&#39;t do the job then, yes, I use the scroll bar.<p>It&#39;s because I&#39;ve been using Logitech Trackballs for maybe 20 years now, starting with a Marble FX and then later switching over to the Trackman Marble when they no longer made the Marble FX.  At some point, I just bought five of it, in case one breaks and they stop making that one too, but none ever did break.</p><p>I just like the precision-feeling that a trackball gives me that a mouse doesn&#39;t.</p><p>Scroll bars have been getting smaller and smaller over the years and over these last couple of years I&#39;ve started to really get into trouble with more and more UIs deciding to turn them off completely.  Of course the people who decide to turn off scroll bars also don&#39;t give a hoot about the keyboard, which really infuriates me, when it leaves me with no option at all to scroll.</p><p>At some point I added a ShuttleXPress Jog wheel to my &#34;rig&#34; on the left-hand side of my keyboard and I&#39;m having its driver simulate a scroll wheel.  But I use it extremely infrequently.  (...so I was totally lying when I said I had no way at all to scroll).

I&#39;ve done therapy on and off (sometimes reactively, like after my Dad died; sometimes a little more pro-actively, like when I had a brutal case of writer&#39;s block during my dissertation prospectus). Never anything I would rate as very serious or urgent. I would say the therapy was not un-useful, in the sense that I didn&#39;t mind taking time out of my day to talk to someone. But I also basically felt like the eventual remediation mostly just stemmed from the acute phase passing or steps I took outside therapy. The thing that got me over my writer&#39;s block was mostly writing. The thing that helped me deal with my Dad dying was mostly more time passing and my life moving on.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have noticed that a lot of people in my life with higher distress loads, and particularly people like the author of this piece who report suffering from fairly serious mental illness, invest a lot of resources into self-help. I think that&#39;s a good instinct, to say &#34;I have a problem and this is a tool that will help fix it&#34;, analogous to seeking medical care for a physical ailment. But my experience is that the vast majority of those people seem to make little apparent progress via self-help, and instead typically continue to report being extremely distressed (though, punctuated with confessionals about how much better things are). For most people levels of distress in life seem to me to be primarily associated with lifelong, or early socialized dispositions; or with major material facts of life (i.e. single/married, broke/affluent, healthy/sick, undergoing a major life change/being severely stuck/doing fine) rather than the particular steps they take to manage or mitigate it. That doesn&#39;t mean therapy doesn&#39;t work, because maybe the counterfactual is they would have gotten much worse absent therapy.</p><p>A few friends from when I was a teenager, people who really struggled with severely gnarly upbringings, abuse, broken homes, early life drug dependency, etc. even went into becoming therapists or social workers. And the strange thing is, it externally seems to me like they&#39;re about as troubled as they were 20+ years ago, modulo having a little more money.</p><p>I guess I would distinguish a lot of these cases from people who are acutely suicidal, people who are actively seeking drug rehabilitation, etc. There seems to be at least some evidence for intervention in those cases. But I am talking about the kind of cases I think you&#39;re talking about.</p><p>So to your broader point, despite again the fact that it&#39;s expressed a bit stridently, I think there&#39;s something there: the evangelism about self-help&#39;s benefits often seems to outstrip self-help&#39;s apparent benefits. There&#39;s probably some element where part of therapy is basically tricking your brain, so the apparent sentiment of someone who is clearly having a hard time beaming about how much better they&#39;re doing might be part of the plan anyway. But externally it can feel jarring to hear &#34;I&#39;m really turning a corner!!!&#34; from someone who&#39;s been struggling for years and continues to struggle.

I now work through the problems in my life in the order in which they cause more problems, and it benefits me in lots of little ways.<p>It&#39;s relevant to the discussion that I think the notion that everyone needs therapy and medication is absurd. I continue to see a therapist as a barrier put into place to make sure I don&#39;t move in a negative direction regarding the more serious personal issues (and take appropriate/healthy actions when a significant problem arises).
