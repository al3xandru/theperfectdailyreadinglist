<h2><b>Exactly-once is a really hard problem</b></h2>
<p><span>Now, I know what some of you are thinking. Exactly-once delivery is impossible, it comes at too high a price to put it to practical use, or I’m getting all this entirely wrong! You’re not alone in thinking that. Some of my industry colleagues recognize that exactly-once delivery is one of the hardest problems to solve in distributed systems.</span></p>

<p><span>Now, I don’t deny that introducing exactly-once delivery semantics — and supporting exactly-once stream processing — is a truly hard problem to solve. But I’ve also witnessed smart distributed systems engineers at</span><a href="https://www.confluent.io/careers"> <span>Confluent</span></a><span> work diligently with the open source community for over a year to solve this problem in Apache Kafka. So let’s jump right in with an overview of messaging semantics.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is exactly-once semantics? Messaging semantics explained</b></h2>
<p><span>In a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system, the computers that make up the system can always fail independently of one another. In the case of Kafka, an individual broker can crash, or a network failure can happen while the producer is sending a message to a topic. Depending on the action the producer takes to handle such a failure, you can get different semantics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>At-least-once semantics</b><span>: if the producer receives an acknowledgement (ack) from the Kafka broker and acks=all, it means that the message has been written exactly once to the Kafka topic. However, if a producer ack times out or receives an error, it might retry sending the message assuming that the message was not written to the Kafka topic. If the broker had failed right before it sent the ack but after the message was successfully written to the Kafka topic, this retry leads to the message being written twice and hence delivered more than once to the end consumer. And everybody loves a cheerful giver, but this approach can lead to duplicated work and incorrect results.</span></li>
<li><b>At-most-once semantics</b><span>: if the producer does not retry when an ack times out or returns an error, then the message might end up not being written to the Kafka topic, and hence not delivered to the consumer. In most cases it will be, but in order to avoid the possibility of duplication, we accept that sometimes messages will not get through. </span></li>
<li><b>Exactly-once semantics</b><span>: even if a producer retries sending a message, it leads to the message being delivered exactly once to the end consumer. Exactly-once semantics is the most desirable guarantee, but also a poorly understood one. This is because it requires a cooperation between the messaging system itself and the application producing and consuming the messages. For instance, if after consuming a message successfully you rewind your Kafka consumer to a previous offset, you will receive all the messages from that offset to the latest one, all over again. This shows why the messaging system and the client application must cooperate to make exactly-once semantics happen.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Failures that must be handled</b></h2>
<p><span>To describe the challenges involved in supporting exactly-once delivery semantics, let’s start with a simple example.</span></p>
<p><span>Suppose there is a single-process producer software application that sends the message “Hello Kafka” to a single-partition Kafka topic called “EoS.” Further suppose that a single-instance consumer application on the other end pulls data from the topic and prints the message. In the happy path where there are no failures, this works well, and the message “Hello Kafka” is written to the EoS topic partition only once. The consumer pulls the message, processes it, and commits the message offset to indicate that it has completed its processing. It will not receive it again, even if the consumer application fails and restarts. </span></p>
<p><span>However, we all know that we can’t count on the happy path. At scale, even unlikely failure scenarios are things that end up happening all the time.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>A broker can fail</b><span>: Kafka is a highly available, persistent, durable system where every message written to a partition is persisted and replicated some number of times (we will call it </span><i><span>n</span></i><span>). As a result, Kafka can tolerate </span><i><span>n-1</span></i><span> broker failures, meaning that a partition is available as long as there is at least one broker available. Kafka’s replication protocol guarantees that once a message has been written successfully to the leader replica, it will be replicated to all available replicas. </span></li>
<li><b>The producer-to-broker RPC can fail: </b><span>Durability in Kafka depends on the producer receiving an ack from the broker. Failure to receive that ack does not necessarily mean that the request itself failed. The broker can crash after writing a message but before it sends an ack back to the producer. It can also crash before even writing the message to the topic. Since there is no way for the producer to know the nature of the failure, it is forced to assume that the message was not written successfully and to retry it. In some cases, this will cause the same message to be duplicated in the Kafka partition log, causing the end consumer to receive it more than once.</span></li>
<li><b>The client can fail</b>: Exactly-once delivery must account for client failures as well. But how can we know that a client has actually failed and is not just temporarily partitioned from the brokers or undergoing an application pause? Being able to tell the difference between a permanent failure and a soft one is important; for correctness, the broker should discard messages sent by a zombie producer. Same is true for the consumer; once a new client instance has been started, it must be able to recover from whatever state the failed instance left behind and begin processing from a safe point. This means that consumed offsets must always be kept in sync with produced output.</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Exactly-once semantics in Apache Kafka</b></h2>
<p><span>Prior to 0.11.x, Apache Kafka supported at-least-once delivery semantics and in-order delivery per partition. As you can tell from the example above, that means producer retries can cause duplicate messages. In the new exactly-once semantics feature, we’ve strengthened Kafka’s software processing semantics in three different and interrelated ways.</span></p>
<h3><b>Idempotence: Exactly-once in order semantics per partition</b></h3>
<p><span>An </span><i><span>idempotent</span></i><span> operation can be performed many times without causing a different effect than only being performed once. The producer send operation is now idempotent. In the event of an error that causes a producer retry, the same message—which is still sent by the producer multiple times—will only be written to the Kafka log on the broker once. For a single partition, Idempotent producer sends remove the possibility of duplicate messages due to producer or broker errors. To turn on this feature and get exactly-once semantics per partition—meaning no duplicates, no data loss, and in-order semantics—configure your producer to set “enable.idempotence=true”.</span></p>
<p><span>How does this feature work? Under the covers, it works in a way similar to TCP: each batch of messages sent to Kafka will contain a sequence number that the broker will use to dedupe any duplicate send. Unlike TCP, though—which provides guarantees only within a transient in-memory connection—this sequence number is persisted to the replicated log, so even if the leader fails, any broker that takes over will also know if a resend is a duplicate. The overhead of this mechanism is quite low: it’s just a few extra numeric fields with each batch of messages. As you will see later in this article, this feature adds negligible performance overhead over the non-idempotent producer.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’d like to try this feature out, follow this <a href="https://kafka-tutorials.confluent.io/message-ordering/kafka.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kafka tutorial</a> on how to maintain message ordering and avoid message duplication.</span></p>
<h3><b>Transactions: Atomic writes across multiple partitions</b></h3>
<p><span>Second, Kafka now supports atomic writes across multiple partitions through the new transactions API. This allows a producer to send a batch of messages to multiple partitions such that either all messages in the batch are eventually visible to any consumer or none are ever visible to consumers. This feature also allows you to commit your consumer offsets in the same transaction along with the data you have processed, thereby allowing end-to-end exactly-once semantics. Here’s an example code snippet to demonstrate the use of the transactions API : </span></p>

<p><span>The code snippet above describes how you can use the new Producer APIs to send messages atomically to a set of topic partitions. It is worth noting that a Kafka topic partition might have some messages that are part of a transaction while others are not. </span></p>
<p><span>So on the consumer side, you have two options for reading transactional messages, expressed through the <code>isolation.level</code> consumer config:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><code><span>read_committed</span></code><span>: In addition to reading messages that are not part of a transaction, you can also read ones that are, after the transaction is committed.</span></li>
<li><code><span>read_uncommitted</span></code><span>: Read all messages in offset order without waiting for transactions to be committed. This option is similar to the current semantics of a Kafka consumer.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>To use transactions, you need to configure the consumer to use the right <code>isolation.level</code>, use the new Producer APIs, and set a producer config <code>transactional.id</code> to some unique ID. This unique ID is needed to provide continuity of transactional state across application restarts.  </span></p>
<h3><b>The real deal: Exactly-once stream processing in Apache Kafka</b></h3>
<p><span>Building on idempotency and atomicity, exactly-once stream processing is now possible through the Streams API in Apache Kafka. All you need to make your Streams application employ exactly-once semantics, is to set this config <code>processing.guarantee=exactly_once</code>. This causes all of the processing to happen exactly once; this includes making both the processing and also all of the materialized state created by the processing job that is written back to Kafka, exactly once.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Note that exactly-once semantics is guaranteed within the scope of Kafka Streams’ internal processing only; for example, if the event streaming app written in Streams makes an RPC call to update some remote stores, or if it uses a customized client to directly read or write to a Kafka topic, the resulting side effects would not be guaranteed exactly once. For more details, please refer to this <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/enabling-exactly-once-kafka-streams">blog post</a>.</span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span>“This is why the exactly-once guarantees provided by Kafka’s Streams API are the strongest guarantees offered by any stream processing system so far. It offers end-to-end exactly-once guarantees for a stream processing application that extends from the data read from Kafka, any state materialized to Kafka by the Streams app, to the final output written back to Kafka. Stream processing systems that only rely on external data systems to materialize state support weaker guarantees for exactly-once stream processing. Even when they use Kafka as a source for stream processing and need to recover from a failure, they can only rewind their Kafka offset to reconsume and reprocess messages, but cannot rollback the associated state in an external system, leading to incorrect results when the state update is not idempotent.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Let me explain that in a little more detail. The critical question for a stream processing system is, “Does my stream processing application get the right answer, even if one of the instances crashes in the middle of processing?” The key, when recovering a failed instance, is to resume processing in exactly the same state as before the crash. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, stream processing is nothing but a read-process-write operation on a Kafka topic; a consumer reads messages from a Kafka topic, some processing logic transforms those messages or modifies state maintained by the processor, and a producer writes the resulting messages to another Kafka topic. Exactly-once stream processing is simply the ability to execute a read-process-write operation exactly one time. In this case, “getting the right answer” means not missing any input messages or producing any duplicate output. This is the behavior users expect from an exactly-once stream processor.</span></p>
<p><span>There are many other failure scenarios to consider besides the simple one we’ve discussed so far:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The stream processor might take input from multiple source topics, and the ordering across these source topics is not deterministic across multiple runs. So if you re-run your stream processor that takes input from multiple source topics, it might produce different results.</span></li>
<li><span>Likewise the stream processor might produce output to multiple destination topics. If the producer cannot do an atomic write across multiple topics, then the producer output can be incorrect if writes to some (but not all) partitions fail. </span></li>
<li><span>The stream processor might aggregate or join data across multiple inputs using the managed state facilities the Streams API provides. If one of the instances of the stream processor fails, then you need to be able to rollback the state materialized by that instance of the stream processor. On restarting the instance, you also need to be able to resume processing and recreate its state.</span></li>
<li>The stream processor might look up enriching information in an external database or by calling out to a service that is updated out of band. Depending on an external service makes the stream processor fundamentally non-deterministic; if the external service changes its internal state between two runs of the stream processor, it leads to incorrect results downstream. However, if handled correctly, this should not lead to entirely incorrect results. It should just lead to the stream processor output belonging to a set of <i>legal</i> outputs. More on this later in the blog.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Failure and restart, especially when combined with non-deterministic operations and changes to the persistent state computed by the application, may result not only in duplicates but also in incorrect results. For example, if one stage of processing is computing a count of the number of events seen, then a duplicate in an upstream processing stage may lead to an incorrect count downstream. So we must qualify the phrase “exactly-once stream processing.” It refers to consuming from a topic, materializing intermediate state in a Kafka topic and producing to one, but not all possible computations done on a message use the Streams API. Some computations (for example, depending on an external service or consuming from multiple source topics) are fundamentally non-deterministic. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span>“The correct way to think of exactly-once stream processing guarantees for deterministic operations is to ensure that the output of a read-process-write operation would be the same as it would if the stream processor saw each message exactly one time—as it would in a case where no failure occurred.”</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>Wait, but what’s exactly-once for non-deterministic operations anyway?</b></h3>
<p><span>That makes sense for deterministic operations, but what does exactly-once stream processing mean when the processing logic itself is non-deterministic? Let’s say the same stream processor that keeps a running count of incoming events is modified to count only those events that satisfy a condition dictated by an external service. Fundamentally, this operation is non-deterministic in nature, since the external condition can change between two distinct runs of the stream processor, potentially leading to different results downstream. So what’s the right way to think about exactly-once guarantees for non-deterministic operations like this? </span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>“The correct way to think of exactly-once guarantees for non-deterministic operations is to ensure that the output of a read-process-write stream processing operation belongs to the subset of legal outputs that would be produced by the combinations of legal values of the non-deterministic input.”</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span>So for our example stream processor above, for a current count of 31 and an input event value of 2, correct output under failures can only be one of {31, 33}: 31 if the input event is discarded as indicated by the external condition, and 33 if it is not.</span></p>
<p><span>This article only scratches the surface of exactly-once stream processing in the Streams API. <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/enabling-exactly-once-kafka-streams">Enabling Exactly-Once in Kafka Streams</a> describes the guarantees in more detail as well as talks about how they compare to exactly-once guarantees in other stream processing systems. </span></p>
<h2><b>Exactly-once guarantees in Kafka: Does it actually work?</b></h2>
<p><span>With any major body of work like this one, a common question is whether the feature works as promised or not. To answer this question for the exactly-once guarantees in Kafka, let’s look into correctness (that is, how we designed, built, and tested this feature) and performance.</span></p>
<h3><b>A meticulous design and review process</b></h3>
<p><span>Correctness and performance both start with a solid design. We started working on a design and prototyping around 2014 at LinkedIn. We iterated on this for over a year at Confluent looking for an elegant way to converge the idempotence and transactional requirements into a holistic package. We wrote a </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Jqy_GjUGtdXJK94XGsEIK7CP1SnQGdp2eF0wSw9ra8/edit#heading=h.xq0ee1vnpz4o"><span>&gt;60 page design document</span></a><span> that outlined every aspect of the design, from the high-level message flow to the nitty-gritty implementation details of every data structure and RPC. This went through an extensive public scrutiny over a nine-month period in which the design improved substantially from community feedback. For instance, thanks to the open source discussion, we replaced consumer-side buffering for transactional reads with smarter server-side filtering, thus avoiding a potentially big performance overhead. In a similar vein, we also refined the interplay of transactions with compacted topics and added security features.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, we ended up with a simple design that also relies on the robust Kafka primitives to a substantial degree. To wit:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Our transaction log is a Kafka topic and hence comes with the attendant durability guarantees.</span></li>
<li><span>Our newly introduced </span><i><span>transaction coordinator </span></i><span>(which manages the transaction state per producer) runs within the broker and naturally leverages Kafka’s leader election algorithm to handle failover.</span></li>
<li><span>For stream processing applications built using Kafka’s Streams API, we leverage the fact that the source of truth for the state store and the input offsets are Kafka topics. Hence we can transparently fold this data into transactions that atomically write to multiple partitions, and thus provide the exactly-once guarantee for streams across the read-process-write operations.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>This simplicity, focus on leverage, and attention to detail meant that the design had more than a fair chance of resulting in an implementation that works well. </span></p>
<h3><b>An iterative development process</b></h3>
<p><span>We developed the feature in the open to ensure that every pull request went through an extensive review. That meant putting some of the pull requests through several dozen iterations over a period of months. This review process found some gaps in the design and innumerable corner cases that were not previously considered.</span></p>
<p><span>We wrote over 15,000 LOC of tests, including distributed tests running with real failures under load, and ran them every night for several weeks looking for problems. This uncovered all manner of issues, ranging from basic coding mistakes to esoteric NTP synchronization issues in our test harness. A subset of these were distributed chaos tests, where we bring up a full Kafka cluster with multiple transactional clients, produce messages transactionally, read these messages concurrently, and hard kill clients and servers during the process to ensure that data is neither lost nor duplicated.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, a simple and solid design with a well-tested, high-quality code base forms the bedrock of our solution.</span></p>
<h3><b>The good news: Kafka is still fast!</b></h3>
<p><span>While designing this feature, a key focus was performance; we wanted our users to be able to use exactly-once delivery and processing semantics beyond just a handful of niche use cases and to be able to actually turn it on by default. We eliminated a lot of simpler design alternatives due to the performance overhead that came with those designs. After much thought, we settled on a design that involves minimal overhead per transaction (~1 write per partition and a few records appended to a central transaction log). This shows in the measured performance of this feature. For 1 KB messages and transactions lasting 100 ms, the producer throughput declines only by 3%, compared to the throughput of a producer configured for at least once, in-order delivery (acks=all, max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=1), and by 20% compared to the throughput of a producer configured for most once delivery with no ordering guarantees (acks=1, max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=5), which is the current default. There are more performance improvements lined up after this first release of exactly-once semantics. For instance, once we check </span><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5494"><span>KAFKA-5494</span></a>, which<span> improves pipelining in the producer, we expect the transactional producer throughput overhead to reduce significantly even when compared to a producer that supports at-most-once delivery with no ordering guarantees. We also found that idempotence has a negligible impact on producer throughput. If you are curious, we have published the </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dHY6M7qCiX-NFvsgvaE0YoVdNq26uA8608XIh_DUpI4/edit#gid=282787170"><span>results of our benchmarking, our test setup, and our test methodology</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to ensuring low-performance overhead for the new features, we also didn’t want to see a performance regression in applications that didn’t use the exactly-once features. To ensure that, we not only added some new fields in the Kafka message header to implement the exactly-once features, but we also reworked the Kafka message format to compress messages more effectively over the wire and on disk. In particular, we moved a bunch of common metadata data into batch headers and introduced variable length encoding into each record within the batch. With this smart batching, the overall message size is significantly smaller. For instance, a batch of 7 records of 10 bytes each would be 35% smaller in the new format. This led to a net gain in raw Kafka </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dHY6M7qCiX-NFvsgvaE0YoVdNq26uA8608XIh_DUpI4/edit#gid=61107630"><span>performance</span></a><span> for I/O bound applications—up to a 20% improvement in producer throughput and up to a 50% improvement in consumer throughput while processing small messages. </span><b>This performance boost is available to any Kafka 0.11 user, even if you don’t use any of the exactly-once features.</b></p>
<p><span>We also had a look into the overhead of exactly-once stream processing using the Streams API. With a short commit interval of 100 ms—that is required to keep end-to-end latency low—we see a throughput degradation of 15% to 30% depending on the message size, which is a 1 KB message size for the former and 100 bytes for the latter. However, a larger commit interval of 30 seconds has no overhead at all for larger message sizes of 1 KB or higher. For the next release, we plan to introduce speculative execution that will allow us to keep end-to-end latency low even if we use a larger commit interval. Thus, we expect to get the overhead of transactions down to zero.</span></p>
<p><span>In summary, by fundamentally reworking some of our core data structures, we gave ourselves the headroom to build the idempotence and transactions feature for minimal performance overhead and to make Kafka faster for everyone. A lot of that hard work and years down the line, we are beyond excited to release the exactly-once feature for the broad Apache Kafka community. For all the diligence that went into building exactly-once semantics in Kafka, there are improvements that will follow as the feature gets widely adopted by the community. We look forward to hearing this feedback and iterating on improvements in upcoming releases of Apache Kafka.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Is this magical pixie dust I can sprinkle on my application?</strong></h2>
<p><span>No, not quite. Exactly-once processing is an end-to-end guarantee and the application has to be designed to not violate the property as well. If you are using the consumer API, this means ensuring that you commit changes to your application state concordant with your offsets as described in the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>For stream processing, the story is actually a bit better. Because stream processing is a closed system, where input, output, and state modifications are all modeled in the same operation, it actually is a bit like magic pixie dust. A single config change will give you the end-to-end guarantee. You still need to get the data out of Kafka, though. When combined with an exactly-once connector, you’ll have this property.</span></p>

In the spring, just before the launch of Fatherly, a Clemson University student’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/dad-bod">viral essay</a> introduced the world to the phrase and image of the <i>dad bod</i>: “a nice balance between a beer gut and working out,” as she put it. Soon <i>dad bod </i>was the subject of hundreds of newspaper stories, including five in <i>The Washington Post</i> alone. But as the phrase’s popularity increased, so did debates about its meaning. Was the dad bod hard or soft? Was it imposing or forgiving? Was it just a state of mind, or was it—as <i>Men’s Health</i> suggested—a dangerous reality? (“<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19545473/stop-the-dad-bod-nonsense/">Face it: The dad bod is just a precursor to dead bod</a>,” the magazine’s editor proclaimed.)</p><p>In its partial lack of definition, the dad bod could stand in for dads’ self-image on the whole. Everybody knew that dads used to earn a living; that they used to love their children from afar; and that when the need arose, they used to be the ones who doled out punishment. But what were dads supposed to do today? “In former times, the definition of a man was you went to work every day, you worked with your muscles, you brought home a paycheck, and that was about it,” the clinical psychologist Thomas J. Harbin would explain to Fatherly a few years later. “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/anger-management-expert-why-men/">What it is to be a man now is in flux</a>, and I think that’s unsettling to a lot of men.” Indeed, modern dads were left to flounder in a half-developed masculinity: Their roles were changing, but their roles hadn’t fully changed.</p><p>A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/12/17/parenting-in-america/st_2015-12-17_parenting-26/">Pew Research Center survey</a>, carried out the autumn after dad-bod fever, found that men cared just as much about their parental identity as moms did about theirs (57 percent described it as being “extremely important,” versus 58 percent of women). But all of that caring served as fuel for newfound insecurity: Most of the moms surveyed—51 percent—said they did “a very good job” of raising their children; among the dads, just 39 percent said the same.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/06/fathers-happiness-sacrifice/619223/">How to Build a Life: The things that make fathers happiest</a></p><p>Fatherly tried to help with this conundrum. The lack of clear-cut standards for successful masculinity, Harbin said, “causes a lot of dissatisfaction that gets expressed as anger.” Men who defined themselves as modern fathers, more nurturing than their own dads had been, could be flummoxed by that rage. An early series on the site, called “Why I Yelled,” interviewed a different father for each installment about a time he’d lost his temper. Many columns ended with the man’s regrets. “I instantly felt like the world’s biggest asshole and just about started crying,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/yelled-sean-35-new-york-city/">one father said</a>. “Here I am losing my shit when my little girl is just having some anxiety issues about starting first grade.” Another dad, whose son had hit him in the shoulder with a baseball, said he’d yelled “because sometimes it needs to happen,” then ended up apologizing. The injury wasn’t that bad, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/why-i-yelled-baseball-call-it/">he admitted</a>. “Honestly, I was being a bit of a pussy.”</p><p>Fatherly had promised from the start to expand its readers’ minds and maybe turn them into “super-dads.” One of the site’s first-ever featured super-dads—an al‑Qaeda-fighting former Navy SEAL—offered his advice: “To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson, who you are will speak more loudly to your children than anything you say.” But as a tip for dads, this shirked the hardest question. Who <i>are</i> they, really? Nurturers, enforcers, role models? Or are they somehow all of those at once?</p><p>A father’s superpower, it emerged, would be self-knowledge. Dr. Spock once reassured mothers with his famous mantra: “Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.” Now Fatherly does the same for dads. “Don’t sweat what you don’t know,” the site’s editors wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780785237822"><i>Fatherhood</i></a>, their omnibus of dad advice, published last year, “because if you know yourself, you know fatherhood.”</p><p><span>In 2015, </span>the journalist and novelist Keith Gessen had a son. His memoir of early parenthood, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780593300442"><i>Raising Raffi: The First Five Years</i></a>, starts off as so many dad books do—with a nod to parenting’s great transition, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/are-fathers-necessary/308136/">dads’ uncertain duties</a>. “I was part of the first generation of men who, for various reasons, were spending more time with their kids than previous generations,” Gessen writes in the introduction. “That seemed notable to me.”</p><p>But his book proceeds as so many dad books don’t: with a father’s careful, piercing introspection, and a deep analysis of anger. “You’re a bad dada and I’m never going to listen to you again!” his 3-year-old son says to him in one scene, after getting yelled at during bedtime. “I felt he was right,” Gessen says. “I was not a good dada. But I didn’t know what else to do.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/are-fathers-necessary/308136/">From the July/August 2010 issue: Are fathers necessary?</a></p><p><i>I didn’t know</i>,<i> I don’t know</i>,<i> I still don’t know</i>—these are the modern dad’s refrains, and the subject of the book. “You don’t know anything about yourself until your baby gets older,” Gessen writes. Parenting is self-discovery. On that principle, <i>Raising Raffi </i>and Fatherly agree. But in Gessen’s case, self-discovery can be a brutal process, revealed not just through intense engagement in the work of child-rearing but also, more particularly, through the bouts of rage that a child may inspire. “You don’t know anything about yourself until the day your adorable little boy looks you in the eye, notices that your face is right up close to him, and punches you in the nose.”</p><p>Gessen writes about his temperamental, trying son with a depth that can only come from years of loving observation. But his son is watching, too. Again and again, Raffi tests his father’s temper—pinching, kicking, scratching, throwing—and then provides his own assessments. “Dada’s not nice,” he says. And: “Dada, I love you even when you do something bad to me.” And: “Dada, superheroes never get mad.” When Raffi gets a sticker chart, at one point, to encourage good behavior, he insists on making another for his parents. Theirs has fields for getting dressed, for eating dinner, and for “not hitting” him. (Those are Raffi’s words, not Gessen’s.)</p><p>If knowledge comes, in part, through Raffi’s provocations, Gessen pays them close attention. “I would find myself yelling or hissing or reprimanding,” he observes, like a clinician making rounds. Elsewhere he says he keeps a diary of incidents in which he’s lost control. In one, he finds his tempest veering from simple yelling into slapping Raffi’s wrist; in another, a push turns into an unintentional rap on the head. “These were the low points,” he says. “But scarier to me were the times when Raffi drove me so out of my mind with anger that I would imagine hitting him for real.”</p><p>Gessen’s tendency to lose control reappears throughout the book. In a chapter on whether Raffi should be raised bilingual, the father’s fury folds into a question of identity. Gessen himself was born in Russia, and immigrated to the U.S. when he was 6. Teaching Raffi to speak Russian would tie him to his past, but also to “a culture and a history,” as Gessen puts it, “that most of us, for various reasons, had wanted to escape.” He wonders whether he could or would ever bring Raffi on a trip to “Putin’s Russia,” the aggressive fatherland, to help him learn the language.</p><p>Naturally, that country’s language is the one Gessen uses when he’s blowing up. “I turned out to be more of a yeller in Russian than I was in English,” he writes.</p><div><blockquote>I found I had a register in Russian that I don’t in English, wherein I made my voice deep and threatening and told Raffi that if he didn’t right away choose which shirt he was going to wear that morning, I was going to choose it for him.</blockquote></div><p>That self-splitting has some benefits. Whenever Gessen fumes at Raffi somewhere near their home in Brooklyn, he knows he’ll have some privacy. “At least I did it in Russian,” he writes, in reference to a bout of yelling in the park.</p><p>It must be nice to have a secret channel for your angry self, hidden even from your wife. To Raffi, though, Gessen’s Russian rages seem duplicitous. “Dada,” he says astutely at one point, “if people understood Russian, they would say, ‘That guy is not nice.’ ” Then Raffi calls his dad a liar, for claiming that he won’t get mad, and for always getting mad again anyway. “This was true,” Gessen says. “I did promise that, and then I always broke that promise.”</p><p>The memoir ends as Fatherly suggests, with Dada at last confronting his identity. One day at the playground, Gessen spots a kind and patient man over by the jungle gym, whose daughter is in the process of losing her mind. “The entire time I thought that the father was doing a remarkable job of staying calm, of not yelling, of not asserting his authority,” Gessen says. “I envied his patience. But I could not do what he was doing—and, I suddenly realized … <i>I would not want to</i>. It wasn’t in me to do.”</p><p><span>When my daughter</span> was born (not long after Gessen’s son), and for most of the next three years, I marveled at the fact that she didn’t make me angry. How could she make me angry? The idea was just absurd. I’d never felt so beset and (I’ll admit it) bored by daily life—and yet I’d also never felt so placid. The baby needed almost everything that I could give, and she seemed to need it all the time. But nothing was her <i>fault</i>.</p><p>In those early, foggy days of fatherhood, I pitched a podcast to my editor. It would be called <i>When Will I Get Angry at My Daughter?</i>, and it would explore the cognitive and moral development of infants and toddlers, as well as the philosophy of moral agency and culpable ignorance. In other words, I was scared of yelling at my daughter, and I tried to quarantine that fear inside a shell of wonder and abstraction. But the anger would be coming just the same, as it does for every parent at some time. My parents had been mad at me, sometimes spanking mad. Their parents had been mad at them. I knew that fathers, in particular, could be very angry, and that angry fathers, in particular, could be very scary. And I didn’t like to think that one day soon I’d lose my temper, too.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/how-men-become-fathers/372678/">Read: What makes men fathers</a></p><p>“Yelling turns out to be a pretty gendered issue,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fatherly.com/parenting/yelling-scares-kids-myths-parenting/">reports an article</a> in Fatherly’s official “Guide to Anger Management.” If testosterone can help you throw a baseball harder, a child psychiatrist says, then it can also make you “hurl your voice” with greater volume and velocity, which is “extra scary” for a kid. “It’s not that moms don’t yell, it’s that fathers yell with more force.”</p><p>As a father, though, I’m concerned less about the sound of yelling than its spirit—what the yelling means, where the yelling might end up. Some fathers are afraid of being angry. Others are afraid of being stony. We’re all afraid of causing pain to our children or, much worse, giving them a lasting wound. Michael Chabon, in his memoir <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780062834621"><i>Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces</i></a>, laments his “latent dickitude” around the house. The book describes one time when Chabon’s 14-year-old daughter had just gotten a new haircut and looked to him for approval. His mind was somewhere else and he failed to muster a response. “For a moment her eyes went wide with fear and doubt,” he writes, before turning the narration on himself: “What a dick!”</p><p>The harm that he’s inflicted can’t be more than subtle disappointment. (I fail tests like these several times a week.) But Chabon’s fretting is unhinged. “She had a crack in her now, fine as a hair but like all cracks irreversible,” he writes.</p><div><blockquote>I was shocked by my own thoughtlessness, and ashamed of it, but the thing I felt most of all was horror. Horror is the only fit response when you are confronted by the full extent of your power to break another human being.</blockquote></div><p>It’s unhinged, but relatable—parenthood unhinges people. I’m sure that every mom and dad has known the fear of messing up their kid. That tension isn’t gendered. But a father’s fear of power—his sense that he might cause some catastrophic damage—may have its own distinctive vibration, one that tweaks the limbic nerve. (Perhaps he worries that, however hard he tries, he’ll never match a mother’s skill at patching wounds.) “I felt this possibility inside me. I was capable of doing it,” Gessen writes of hitting Raffi, <i>really</i> hitting him. This fantasy of transformation, from dad bod to the Hulk, elevates the stakes.</p><p>Discipline used to be the dad’s domain—his solid ground, the site of male authority at home. Now it’s just the opposite: a quicksand of confusing implications, where the angry dad exerts control but also loses it. Gessen’s book maps out this terrain. In a scene outside a restaurant, where Raffi has spilled his water and thrown his hot dog on the floor, Gessen ends up shaking his son upside down, to make the boy stop hitting him. Raffi cries and whines and then dissolves into fearful, desperate peals of laughter. “I was angry—and he was scared,” Gessen writes. Surely the converse was also true.</p><p>Memoirs of fatherhood are rarely so honest or so blunt. Chabon gestures at the same horrible potential—father as destroyer—but sublimates it in theatrics. Other dad books hide behind an image of bumbling befuddlement, as if a modern father couldn’t break his kids if he wanted to. Even Fatherly, today’s proponent of “Father, know thyself,” turned out to be an accidental billboard for toxic masculinity. When the site <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150315014303/http:/fatherly.com/child-care/development/eric-greitens-10-tips-for-raising-resilient-kids/">debuted with counsel from the former Navy SEAL</a>, that dad was Eric Greitens. Greitens, who went on to serve as governor of Missouri, has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/us/missouri-greitens-house-impeachment-inquiry.html">accused by his former hairdresser of sexual assault</a>, and by his ex-wife of physical abuse. In a sworn affidavit, the latter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/03/21/eric-greitens-accused-of-physical-abuse-in-affidavit-filed-by-his-ex-wife/">told a judge</a> that he’d hit their 3-year-old son and yanked the boy around by the hair. (Greitens has denied all of these allegations, and was not formally charged with assault; the article about him is no longer on Fatherly.)</p><p>I don’t mean to say that every dad has darkness in his soul, but rather that the darkness now hangs above us all, shading a father’s quest for self-discovery with dread. My daughter was born into an atmosphere of male aggression. I bottle-fed her through Election Night in 2016. The Harvey Weinstein story broke around the time she turned 1. At her second-birthday party, the kids ate cupcakes while the parents whispered about Christine Blasey Ford’s congressional testimony. By the time she turned 3, Bill Cosby—“America’s Dad,” and the author of an early book on what it means to be a modern father—was appealing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/09/andrea-constand-bill-cosby-burden-being-only-witness/571093/">his conviction</a> on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. (His conviction was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/06/bill-cosbys-release-is-not-an-exoneration/619335/">overturned</a> last year.)</p><p>“If you know yourself, you know fatherhood,” Fatherly’s advice book says. But for me, and perhaps for Gessen and the other fathers of our micro-generation, this promise comes off as a threat. We were told, not so long ago, that dads had reached the cusp of something new—that they could start “embracing what they’ve become,” as Fatherly suggested in 2015, without “giving up on who they are.” It feels as though evidence against this claim has been mounting ever since. What if I don’t want to know the ways my identity will be inflicted on my children?</p><p>Near the end of <i>Raising Raffi</i>, Gessen offers up a route around this snare of anger and self-doubt. A father’s journey with his child, he observes, involves “pass[ing] through a terrible struggle” for independence and connection, which ends <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/06/fathers-happiness-sacrifice/619223/">only when he’s no longer needed</a>. This is the “tragedy of parenthood,” he says: To know yourself as a father is to understand the limits of your role. “You succeed when you make yourself irrelevant, when you erase yourself. Parents who fail to do that have failed.”</p><p>So embrace what you’ve become. But then you have to learn to let it go.</p><hr/><p><small><em>This article appears in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2022/07/">July/August 2022</a> print edition with the headline “Why Is Dad So Mad?”</em></small></p><div><hr/><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

  <p>I always loved the visual aesthetic of dithering but never knew how it’s done. So I did some research. This article may contain traces of nostalgia and none of Lena.</p>

<h2>How did I get here? (You can skip this)</h2>

<p>I am late to the party, but I finally played <a href="https://obradinn.com/">“Return of the Obra Dinn”</a>, the most recent game by <a href="https://twitter.com/dukope">Lucas Pope</a> of <a href="https://papersplea.se/">“Papers Please”</a> fame. Obra Dinn is a story puzzler that I can only recommend, but what piqued my curiosity as a software engineer is that it is a 3D game (using the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity game engine</a>) but rendered using only 2 colors with dithering. Apparently, this has been dubbed “Ditherpunk”, and I love that.</p>

<p>Dithering, so my original understanding, was a technique to place pixels using only a <em>few</em> colors from a palette in a clever way to trick your brain into seeing <em>many</em> colors. Like in the picture, where you probably feel like there are multiple brightness levels when in fact there’s only two: Full brightness and black.</p>
<p>The fact that I have never seen a 3D game with dithering like this probably stems from the fact that color palettes are mostly a thing of the past. You <em>may</em> remember running Windows 95 with 16 colors and playing games like “Monkey Island” on it.</p>

<p>For a long time now, however, we have had 8 bits per channel per pixel, allowing each pixel on your screen to assume one of 16 million colors. With HDR and wide gamut on the horizon, things are moving even further away to ever requiring any form of dithering. And yet Obra Dinn used it anyway and rekindled a long forgotten love for me. Knowing a tiny bit about dithering from my work on <a href="https://squoosh.app">Squoosh</a>, I was especially impressed with Obra Dinn’s ability to keep the dithering stable while I moved and rotated the camera through 3D space and I wanted to understand how it all worked.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Lucas Pope wrote a <a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.msg1363742#msg1363742">forum post</a> where he explains which dithering techniques he uses and how he applies them to 3D space. He put extensive work into making the dithering stable when camera movements occur. Reading that forum post kicked me down the rabbit hole, which this blog post tries to summarize.</p>
<h2>Dithering</h2>
<h3>What is Dithering?</h3>
<p>According to Wikipedia, “Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error”, and is a technique not only limited to images. It is actually a technique used to this day on audio recordings, but that is yet another rabbit hole to fall into another time. Let’s dissect that definition in the context of images. First up: Quantization.</p>
<h3>Quantization</h3>
<p>Quantization is the process of mapping a large set of values to a smaller, usually finite, set of values. For the remainder of this article, I am going to use two images as examples:</p>
<figure>
  <img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" src="https://surma.dev/assets/dark-original.ace4db66.png"/>
  <figcaption>Example image #1: A black-and-white photograph of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, downscaled to 400x267 (<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/dark-hires.jpg" target="_blank">higher resolution</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img loading="lazy" width="253" height="400" src="https://surma.dev/assets/light-original.27bdc8b3.png"/>
  <figcaption>Example image #2: A black-and-white photograph of San Francisco’s Bay Bridge, downscaled to 253x400 (<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/light-hires.jpg" target="_blank">higher resolution</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Both black-and-white photos use 256 different shades of gray. If we wanted to use fewer colors — for example just black and white to achieve monochromaticity — we have to change every pixel to be either pure black or pure white. In this scenario, the colors black and white are called our “color palette” and the process of changing pixels that do not use a color from the palette is called “quantization”. Because not all colors from the original images are in the color palette, this will inevitably introduce an error called the “quantization error”. The naïve solution is to quantizer each pixel to the color in the palette that is closest to the pixel’s original color.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Defining which colors are “close to each other” is open to interpretation and depends on how you measure the distance between two colors. I suppose ideally we’d measure distance in a psycho-visual way, but most of the articles I found simply used the euclidian distance in the RGB cube, i.e. <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><msup><mtext>red</mtext><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><msup><mtext>green</mtext><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><msup><mtext>blue</mtext><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{\Delta\text{red}^2 + \Delta\text{green}^2 + \Delta\text{blue}^2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our palette only consisting of black and white, we can use the brightness of a pixel to decide which color to quantize to. A brightness of 0 means black, a brightness of 1 means white, everything else is in-between, ideally correlating with human perception such that a brightness of 0.5 is a nice mid-gray. To quantize a given color, we only need to check if the color’s brightness is greater or less than 0.5 and quantize to white and black respectively. Applying this quantization to the image above yields an... unsatisfying result.</p>

<h3>Gamma</h3>
<p>I had finished writing this article and just wanted to “quickly” look what a black-to-white gradient looks like with the different dithering algorithms. The results showed me that I failed to consider <em>the thing</em> that always becomes a problem when working with images: color spaces. I had written the sentence “ideally correlating with human perception” without actually following it myself.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://surma.dev/lab/ditherpunk/lab.html">demo</a> is implemented using web technologies, most notably <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and <code>ImageData</code>, which are — at the time of writing — specified to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>. It’s an old color space specification (from 1996) whose value-to-color mapping was modeled to mirror the behavior of CRT monitors. While barely anyone uses CRTs these days, it’s still considered the “safe” color space that gets correctly displayed on every display. As such, it is the default on the web platform. However, sRGB is not linear, meaning that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in sRGB is <em>not</em> the color a human sees when you mix 50% of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(0, 0, 0)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(1, 1, 1)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Instead, it’s the color you get when you pump half the power of full white through your Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> I set <code>image-rendering: pixelated;</code> on most of the images in this article. This allows you to zoom in and truly see the pixels. However, on devices with fraction <code>devicePixelRatio</code>, this might introduce artifacts. If in doubt, open the image separate in a new tab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this image shows, the dithered gradient gets bright way too quickly. If we want 0.5 be the color in the middle of pure black and white (as perceived by a human), we need to convert from sRGB to linear RGB space, which can be done with a process called “gamma correction”. Wikipedia lists the following formulas to convert between sRGB and linear RGB.</p>

<h3>Random noise</h3>
<p>Back to Wikipedia’s definition of dithering: “Intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error”. We got the quantization down, and now it says to add noise. <em>Intentionally.</em></p>
<p>Instead of quantizing each pixel directly, we add noise with a value between -0.5 and 0.5 to each pixel. The idea is that some pixels will now be quantized to the “wrong” color, but how often that happens depends on the pixel’s original brightness. Black will <em>always</em> remain black, white will <em>always</em> remain white, a mid-gray will be dithered to black roughly 50% of the time. Statistically, the overall quantization error is reduced and our brains are eager to do the rest and help you see the, uh, big picture.</p>

<p>I found this quite surprising! It is by no means <em>good</em> — video games from the 90s have shown us that we can do better — but this is a very low effort and quick way to get more detail into a monochrome image. And if I was to take “dithering” literally, I’d end my article here. But there’s more…</p>
<h2>Ordered Dithering</h2>
<p>Instead of talking about what kind of noise to add to an image before quantizing it, we can also change our perspective and talk about adjusting the quantization threshold.</p>

<p>In the context of monochrome dithering, where the quantization threshold is 0.5, these two approaches are equivalent:</p>

<p>The upside of this approach is that we can talk about a “threshold map”. Threshold maps can be visualized to make it easier to reason about why a resulting image looks the way it does. They can also be precomputed and reused, which makes the dithering process deterministic and parallelizable per pixel. As a result, the dithering can happen on the GPU as a shader. This is what Obra Dinn does! There are a couple of different approaches to generating these threshold maps, but all of them introduce some kind of order to the noise that is added to the image, hence the name “ordered dithering”.</p>
<p>The threshold map for the random dithering above, literally a map full of random thresholds, is also called “white noise”. The name comes from a term in signal processing where every frequency has the same intensity, just like in white light.</p>

<h3>Bayer Dithering</h3>
<p>“Bayer dithering” uses a Bayer matrix as the threshold map. They are named after Bryce Bayer, inventor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">Bayer filter</a>, which is in use to this day in digital cameras. Each pixel on the sensor can only detect brightness, but by cleverly arranging colored filters in front of the individual pixels, we can reconstruct color images through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing">demosaicing</a>. The pattern for the filters is the same pattern used in Bayer dithering.</p>

<p>In our dark test image, the sky is not pure black and made <em>significantly</em> brighter when using Bayer Level 0. While it gets better with higher levels, an alternative solution is to flip the bias and make images render <em>darker</em> by inverting the way we use the Bayer matrix:</p>

<h3>Blue noise</h3>
<p>Both white noise and Bayer dithering have drawbacks, of course. Bayer dithering, for example, is very structured and will look quite repetitive, especially at lower levels. White noise is random, meaning that there inevitably will be clusters of bright pixels and voids of darker pixels in the threshold map. This can be made more obvious by squinting or, if that is too much work for you, through blurring the threshold map algorithmically. These clusters and voids can affect the output of the dithering process negatively. If darker areas of the image fall into one of the clusters, details will get lost in the dithered output (and vice-versa for brighter areas falling into voids).</p>
<figure>
  <img loading="lazy" width="256" height="128" src="https://surma.dev/assets/whitenoiseblur.73f0ad34.png"/>
  <figcaption>Clear clusters and voids remain visible even after applying a Gaussian blur (σ = 1.5).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a variant of noise called “<em>blue</em> noise”, that addresses this issue. It is called blue noise because higher frequencies have higher intensities compared to the lower frequencies, just like blue light. By removing or dampening the lower frequencies, cluster and voids become less pronounced. Blue noise dithering is just as fast to apply to an image as white noise dithering — it’s just a threshold map in the end — but <em>generating</em> blue noise is a bit harder and expensive.</p>
<p>The most common algorithm to generate blue noise seems to be the “void-and-cluster method” by <a href="http://ulichney.com/">Robert Ulichney</a>. Here is the <a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/bluenoise-1993.pdf">original whitepaper</a>. I found the way the algorithm is described quite unintuitive and, now that I have implemented it, I am convinced it is explained in an unnecessarily abstract fashion. But it is quite clever!</p>
<p>The algorithm is based on the idea that you can find a pixel that is part of cluster or a void by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur">Gaussian Blur</a> to the image and finding the brightest (or darkest) pixel in the blurred image respectively. After initializing a black image with a couple of randomly placed white pixels, the algorithm proceeds to continuously swap cluster pixels and void pixels to spread the white pixels out as evenly as possible. Afterwards, every pixel gets a number between 0 and n (where n is the total number of pixels) according to their importance for forming clusters and voids. For more details, see the <a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/bluenoise-1993.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<p>My implementation works fine but is not very fast, as I didn’t spend much time optimizing. It takes about 1 minute to generate a 64×64 blue noise texture on my 2018 MacBook, which is sufficient for these purposes. If something faster is needed, a promising optimization would be to apply the Gaussian Blur not in the spatial domain but in the frequency domain instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Excursion:</strong> Of <em>course</em> knowing this nerd-sniped me into implementing it. The reason this optimization is so promising is because convolution (which is the underlying operation of a Gaussian blur) has to loop over each field of the Gaussian kernel <em>for each pixel</em> in the image. However, if you convert both the image as well as the Gaussian kernel to the frequency domain (using one of the many Fast Fourier Transform algorithms), convolution becomes an element-wise multiplication. Since my targeted blue noise size is a power of two, I could implement the well-explored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm#Data_reordering,_bit_reversal,_and_in-place_algorithms">in-place variant of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm</a>. After <a href="https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/1341203941904834561">some initial hickups</a>, it did end up cutting the blue noise generation time by 50%. I still wrote pretty garbage-y code, so there’s a lot more to room for optimizations.</p>

</figure>
<p>As blue noise is based on a Gaussian Blur, which is calculated on a torus (a fancy way of saying that Gaussian blur wraps around at the edges), blue noise will also tile seamlessly. So we can use the 64×64 blue noise and repeat it to cover the entire image. Blue noise dithering has a nice, even distribution without showing any obvious patterns, balancing rendering of details and organic look.</p>

<h2>Error diffusion</h2>
<p>All the previous techniques rely on the fact that quantization errors will <em>statistically</em> even out because the thresholds in the threshold maps are uniformly distributed. A different approach to quantization is the concept of error diffusion, which is most likely what you have read about if you have ever researched image dithering before. In this approach we don’t just quantize and hope that on average the quantization error remains negligible. Instead, we <em>measure</em> the quantization error and diffuse the error onto neighboring pixels, influencing how they will get quantized. We are effectively changing the image we want to dither as we go along. This makes the process inherently sequential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> One big advantage of error diffusion algorithms that we won’t touch on <em>in this post</em> is that they can handle arbitrary color palettes, while ordered dithering requires your color palette to be evenly spaced. More on that another time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost all error diffusion ditherings that I am going to look at use a “diffusion matrix”, which defines how the quantization error from the current pixel gets distributed across the neighboring pixels. For these matrices it is often assumed that the image’s pixels are traversed top-to-bottom, left-to-right — the same way us westerners read text. This is important as the error can only be diffused to pixels that haven’t been quantized yet. If you find yourself traversing an image in a different order than the diffusion matrix assumes, flip the matrix accordingly.</p>
<h3>“Simple” 2D error diffusion</h3>
<p>The naïve approach to error diffusion shares the quantization error between the pixel below the current one and the one to the right, which can be described with the following matrix:</p>

\right)
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<figcaption>Diffusion matrix that shares half the error to 2 neightboring pixels, * marking the current pixel.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The diffusion algorithm visits each pixel in the image (in the right order!), quantizes the current pixel and measures the quantization error. Note that the quantization error is signed, i.e. it can be negative if the quantization made the pixel brighter than the original brightness value. We then add fractions of the quantization error to neighboring pixels as specified by the matrix. Rinse and repeat.</p>

</figure>
<p>This animation is supposed to visualize the algorithm, but won’t be able to show that the dithered result resembles the original. 4×4 pixels are hardly enough do diffuse and average out quantization errors. But it does show that if a pixel is made brighter during quantization, neighboring pixels will be made <em>darker</em> to make up for it (and vice-versa).</p>

<p>However, the simplicity of the diffusion matrix is prone to generating patterns, like the line-like patterns you can see in the test images above.</p>
<h3>Floyd-Steinberg</h3>
<p>Floyd-Steinberg is arguably the most well-known error diffusion algorithm, if not even the most well-known dithering algorithm. It uses a more elaborate diffusion matrix to distribute the quantization error to <em>all</em> directly neighboring, unvisited pixels. The numbers are carefully chosen to prevent repeating patterns as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Riemersma Dither</h3>
<p>To be completely honest, the Riemersma dither is something I stumbled upon by accident. I found an <a href="https://www.compuphase.com/riemer.htm">in-depth article</a> while I was researching the other dithering algorithms. It doesn’t seem to be widely known, but I <em>really</em> like the way it looks and the concept behind it. Instead of traversing the image row-by-row it traverses the image with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve">Hilbert curve</a>. Technically, any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve">space-filling curve</a> would do, but the Hilbert curve came recommended and is <a href="https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/1343569629369786368">rather easy to implement using generators</a>. Through this it aims to take the best of both ordered dithering and error diffusion dithering: Limiting the number of pixels a single pixel can influence together with the organic look (and small memory footprint).</p>

<figcaption>Visualization of the 256x256 Hilbert curve by making pixels brighter the later they are visited by the curve.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Hilbert curve has a “locality” property, meaning that the pixels that are close together on the curve are also close together in the picture. This way we don’t need to use an error diffusion matrix but rather a diffusion <em>sequence</em> of length <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

In the article they use an exponential falloff for the weights — the previous pixel’s quantization error getting a weight of 1, the oldest quantization error in the list a small, chosen weight <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. This results in the following formula for the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>th weight:</p>

<p>The dithering looks extremely organic, almost as good as blue noise dithering. At the same time it is easier to implement than both of the previous ones. It is, however, still an error diffusion dithering algorithm, meaning it is sequential and not suitable to run on a GPU.</p>
<h2>💛 Blue noise, Bayer &amp; Riemersma</h2>
<p>As a 3D game, Obra Dinn <em>had</em> to use ordered dithering to be able to run it as a shader. It uses both Bayer dithering and blue noise dithering which I also think are the most aesthetically pleasing choices. Bayer dithering shows a bit more structure while blue noise looks very natural and organic. I am also particularly fond of the Riemersma dither and I want to explore how it holds up when there are multiple colors in the palette.</p>
<p>Obra Dinn uses blue noise dithering for most of the environment. People and other objects of interest are dithered using Bayer, which forms a nice visual contrast and makes them stand out without breaking the games overall aesthetic. Again, more on his reasoning as well his solution to handling camera movement in his <a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.msg1363742#msg1363742">forum post</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to try different dithering algorithms on one of your own images, take a look at my <a href="https://surma.dev/lab/ditherpunk/lab.html">demo</a> that I wrote to generate all the images in this blog post. Keep in mind that these are not the fastest. If you decide to throw your 20 megapixel camera JPEG at this, it will take a while.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It seems I am hitting a de-opt in Safari. My blue noise generator takes ~30 second in Chrome, but takes &gt;20 minutes Safari. It is considerably quicker in Safari Tech Preview.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am sure this super niche, but I enjoyed this rabbit hole. If you have any opinions or experiences with dithering, I’d love to hear them.</p>
<h2>Thanks &amp; other sources</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/dukope">Lucas Pope</a> for his games and the visual inspiration.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/momentsincg">Christoph Peters</a> for his excellent <a href="http://momentsingraphics.de/BlueNoise.html">article on blue noise generation</a>.</p>
