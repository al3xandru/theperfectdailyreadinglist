		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://medium.com/@stewart?source=post_page-----4c59524d650d--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Stewart Butterfield" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*9wu8F2g7Pk1wDG2k.png" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy" data-testid="authorPhoto"/></p></div></a></div><blockquote><p id="2a61">The memo below was sent to the team at Tiny Speck, the makers of <a href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Slack</strong></a>, on <em>July 31st, 2013</em>. It had been a little under seven months since development began and was two weeks before the launch of Slack’s ‘Preview Release’. It is presented verbatim, as written (including original pull-quotes), with two exceptions: the removal of an introductory section discussing launch logistics and replacement of a link which pointed to an internal company resource with the equivalent public link.</p></blockquote><p id="bfb0">We know that we have built something which is genuinely useful: almost any team which adopts Slack as their central application for communication would be significantly better off than they were before. That means we have something people want.</p><p id="8539">However, almost all of them have no idea that they want Slack. How could they? They’ve never heard of it. And only a vanishingly small number will have imagined it on their own. They think they want something different (if they think they want anything at all). They definitely are not looking for Slack. (But then no-one was looking for Post-it notes or GUIs either.)</p><p id="fa10">Just as much as our job is to build something genuinely useful, something which really does make people’s working lives simpler, more pleasant and more productive, our job is also to understand what people think they want and then translate the value of Slack into their terms.</p><p id="746b">A good part of that is “just marketing,” but even the best slogans, ads, landing pages, PR campaigns, etc., will fall down if they are not supported by the experience people have when they hit our site, when they sign up for an account, when they first begin using the product and when they start using it day in, day out.</p><p id="fd61">Therefore, “understanding what people think they want and then translating the value of Slack into their terms” <em>is something we all work on. </em>It is the sum of the exercise of all our crafts. We do it with copy accompanying signup forms, with fast-loading pages, with good welcome emails, with comprehensive and accurate search, with purposeful loading screens, and with thoughtfully implemented and well-functioning features of all kinds.</p><p id="f1a9">Much has been written about “product-market fit” in the last few years, probably as a result of the popularity of the lean startup movement (though the idea has been around much longer). The term refers to the degree to which a product <em>could </em>be successful, given sufficient promotion, appropriate pricing, adequate customer support and so on (before you find that fit, all the pushing in the world won’t get you up the hill).</p><p id="fb0b">In this <a href="http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/pmarcaarchive/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups-part-4-the-only/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">classic post</a> on Marc Andreessen’s old blog, he calls getting to product-market fit the “only thing that matters” for startups and offers a way of thinking about the life of the startup that divides it into two distinct phases: before product-market fit and after. Once the product fits the market, a company is able to step on the gas, spending to promote a product that will actually sell. The things you need to do before are very different from the things you need to do after (generally test &amp; iterate vs scale &amp; optimize).</p><p id="0186">We are right in the middle of that first phase. It seems we are doing well and there are many encouraging signs, but we’re definitely still in the first phase and it is very, very hard to tell how far we have to go to cross over into the promised land (the last 10% is 90% of the work, etc.) So, we should be working carefully from <em>both </em>the product end and the market end:</p><ul><li id="5091">Doing a better and better job of providing what people want (whether they know it or not)</li><li id="b448">Communicating the above more and more effectively (so that they know they want it)</li></ul><p id="ebf1">In the best case, there is a dialectic at play here: the product itself and the way people use it should suggest new ways of articulating the value — and refinements to how we communicate the value should lead to principles which clarify decision-making around product features and design.</p><p id="f011">Our position is different than the one many new companies find themselves in: we are not battling it out in a large, well-defined market with clear incumbents (which is why we can’t get away with “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059578/quotes?item=qt0472849" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Other group chat products are poisonous. Slack is toasted</a>.”). Despite the fact that there are a handful of direct competitors and a muddled history of superficially similar tools, we are setting out to define a new market. And that means we can’t limit ourselves to tweaking the product; we need to tweak the market too.</p><figure></figure><p id="0327">The best — maybe the only? — real, direct measure of “innovation” is change in human behaviour. In fact, it is useful to take this way of thinking as definitional: innovation <em>is </em>the sum of change across the whole system, not a thing which <em>causes </em>a change in how people behave. No small innovation ever caused a large shift in how people spend their time and no large one has ever failed to do so.</p><p id="80e0">By that measure, Slack is a real and large innovation. It is not as eye-catching as self-driving cars or implantable chips — it is not basic research-y kind of stuff. But, for organizations that adopt it, there will be a dramatic shift in how time is spent, how communication happens, and how the team’s archives are utilized. There will be changes in how team members relate to one another and, hopefully, significant changes in productivity.</p><p id="a2aa">We are unlikely to be able to sell “a group chat system” very well: there are just not enough people shopping for group chat system (and, as pointed out elsewhere, our current fax machine works fine).</p><blockquote><p id="4d84">That’s why what we’re selling is <em>organizational transformation.</em></p></blockquote><p id="43fd">What we are selling is <em>not </em>the software product — the set of all the features, in their specific implementation — because there are just not many buyers for this software product. (People buy “software” to address a need they already know they have or perform some specific task they need to perform, whether that is tracking sales contacts or editing video.)</p><p id="7616">However, if we are selling “a reduction in the cost of communication” or “zero effort knowledge management” or “making better decisions, faster” or “all your team communication, instantly searchable, available wherever you go” or “75% less email” or some other valuable <em>result </em>of adopting Slack, we will find many more buyers.</p><p id="6575">That’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation. The software just happens to be the part we’re able to build &amp; ship (and the means for us to get our cut).</p><p id="2618">We’re selling a reduction in information overload, relief from stress, and a new ability to extract the enormous value of hitherto useless corporate archives. We’re selling better organizations, better teams. That’s a good thing for people to buy and it is a much better thing for us to sell in the long run. We will be successful to the extent that we create better teams.</p><p id="ff87">To see why, consider the hypothetical Acme Saddle Company. They could just sell saddles, and if so, they’d probably be selling on the basis of things like the quality of the leather they use or the fancy adornments their saddles include; they could be selling on the range of styles and sizes available, or on durability, or on price.</p><p id="6cfc">Or, they could sell <em>horseback riding</em>. Being successful at selling horseback riding means they grow the market for their product while giving the perfect context for talking about their saddles. It lets them position themselves as the leader and affords them different kinds of marketing and promotion opportunities (e.g., sponsoring school programs to promote riding to kids, working on land conservation or trail maps). It lets them think big and potentially be big.</p><blockquote><p id="c9cf">Because the best possible way to find product-market fit<br/>is to define your own market.</p></blockquote><p id="9736">This isn’t a new idea. There are many brands whose marketing activities or positioning has them selling something other than (and usually larger than) their product: Harley Davidson sells motorcycle riding, but it especially sells freedom and independence. Most luxury brands sell something that comes down to “being better than you are” (richer, better looking, more attractive to those you find desirable, etc.)</p><p id="3bbf">My favorite recent example is Lululemon: when they started, there was not a large market for yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories. They sold yoga like crazy: helping people find yoga studios near their homes, hosting free classes, sponsorships and scholarships, local ambassadors and training, etc. And as a result, they sold just under $1.4 billion worth of yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories in their most recent fiscal year.</p><p id="02b6">But going back to the Acme Saddle Company, the better analogy to what we are doing now is to imagine them selling horseback riding … about 4,000 years ago. It is almost inevitable that centralized internal communication systems will gradually replace email for most organizations over the next 10-20 years and we should do what we can to accelerate the trend and “own it”. We are at the beginning of a transition. We have an opportunity to both define the category and push hard for the whole market’s growth. We’d be crazy not to take it, because the best possible way to find product-market fit is to define your own market.</p><p id="1a69">A few months ago, I read a fairly mediocre ebook called “Who Do You Want Your Customers to Become?” (available<a href="http://hbr.org/product/who-do-you-want-your-customers-to-become/an/11245-KND-ENG" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> here</a>). It was mediocre because it was nearly 70 pages when it could have been 20, not because the ideas were bad: in fact, the core ideas of the piece are fascinating and, I think, very useful to us as we think about the next year or so of Slack.</p><p id="df52">A central thesis is that <em>all products are asking things of their customers</em>: to do things in a certain way, to think of themselves in a certain way — and usually that means changing what one does or how one does it; it often means changing how one thinks of oneself.</p><p id="b1a2"><strong>We are asking a lot from our customers. </strong>We are asking them to spend hours a day in a new and unfamiliar application, to give up on years or even decades of experience using email for work communication (and abandon all kinds of ad hoc workflows that have developed around their use of email). We are asking them to switch a model of communication which defaults to public; it is an almost impossibly large ask. Almost.</p><p id="4187">To get people to say yes to a request that large, we need to (1) offer them a reward big enough to justify their effort and (2) do an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution.</p><p id="d1cf">The best way to imagine the reward is thinking about who we want our customers to become:</p><ul><li id="1232">We want them to become relaxed, productive workers who have the confidence that comes from knowing that any bit of information which might be valuable to them is only a search away.</li><li id="3c61">We want them to become masters of their own information and not slaves*, overwhelmed by the neverending flow.</li><li id="7ace">We want them to feel less frustrated by a lack of visibility into what is going on with their team.</li><li id="3f53">We want them to become people who communicate purposively, knowing that each question they ask is actually building value for the whole team.</li></ul><p id="6f2c">This is what we have to be able to offer them, and it is the aim and purpose of all the work we are doing. We need to make them understand what’s at the end of the rainbow if they go with Slack, and then we have to work our asses off in order to ensure they get there.</p><p id="5b9f">We do it really, really fucking good.</p><p id="8b64">The reason for saying we need to do ‘an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution’ is this: When you want something really bad, you will put up with a lot of flaws. But if you do not yet know you want something, your tolerance will be much lower. That’s why it is especially important for us to build a beautiful, elegant and considerate piece of software. Every bit of grace, refinement, and thoughtfulness on our part will pull people along. Every petty irritation will stop them and give the impression that it is not worth it.</p><p id="55bc">That means we have to find all those petty irritations, and quash them. We need to look at our own work from the perspective of a new potential customer and <em>actually see what’s there. </em>Does it make sense? Can you predict what’s going to happen when you click that button or open that menu? Is there sufficient feedback to know if the click or tap worked? Is it fast enough? If I read the email on my phone and click the link, is it broken?</p><blockquote><p id="5711"><em>None of the work we are doing to develop<br/>the product is an end in itself.</em></p></blockquote><p id="b12c">It is always harder to do this with one’s own product: we skip over the bad parts knowing that we plan to fix it later. We already know the model we’re using and the terms we use to describe it. It is very difficult to approach Slack with beginner’s mind. But we have to, all of us, and we have to do it every day, over and over and polish every rough edge off until this product is as smooth as lacquered mahogany.</p><p id="3d3d">Each of you knows “really good”. Each of you is able to see when things are not done well. Certainly we all complain enough about other people’s software, and we all know how important first impressions are in our own judgements. That is exactly how others will evaluate us.</p><p id="8dc0">Putting yourself in the mind of someone who is coming to Slack for the first time — especially a real someone, who is being made to try this thing by their boss, who is already a bit hangry because they didn’t have time for breakfast, and who is anxious about finishing off a project before they take off for the long weekend — putting yourself in their mind means looking at Slack the way you look at some random piece of software in which you have no investment and no special interest. Look at it hard, and find the things that do not work. Be harsh, in the interest of being excellent.</p></div><div><p id="1723">There’s no point doing this to be small. We should go big, if only because there are a lot of people in the world who deserve Slack. Going big also means that it will have to be really, really good. But that’s convenient, since there’s also no point doing it if it is not really, really good. Life is too short to do mediocre work and it is definitely too short to build shitty things.</p><p id="9744">To do this well, we need to take a holistic approach and not just think about a long list of individual tasks we are supposed to get through in a given week. We get 0 points for just getting a feature out the door if it is not actually contributing to making the experience better for users, or helping them to understand Slack, or helping us understand them. None of the work we are doing to develop the product is an end in itself; it all must be squarely aimed at the larger purpose.</p><p id="4d29">Consider the teams you see in action at great restaurants, and the totality of their effort: the room, the vibe, the timing, the presentation, the attention, the anticipation of your needs (and, of course, the food itself); nothing can be off. There is a great nobility in being of service to others, and well-run restaurants (or hotels, or software companies) serve with a quality that is measured by its attention to detail. This is a perfect model for us to emulate.</p><p id="8ce4">Ensuring that the pieces all come together is not someone else’s job. It is your job, no matter what your title is and no matter what role you play. The pursuit of that purpose should permeate everything we do.</p><p id="d0a3">But Slack is a bit more complicated than a restaurant (at least in some ways). Since it is new and less familiar, we are less able to fall back on well-established best practices. That means we need to listen, watch &amp; analyze carefully. We’ll need to build tools to capture users’ behaviour and reactions. And then we’ll need to take all that information and our best instincts and be continuously improving.</p><p id="0ca2">We are an exceptional software development team. But, we now also need be an excellent customer development team. That’s why, in the first section of this doc, I said “build a customer base” rather than “gain market share”: the nature of the task is different, and we will work together to understand, anticipate and better serve the people who trust us with their teams’ communications, one customer at a time.</p><p id="8f24">The answer to “Why?” is “because why the fuck else would you even want to be alive but to do things as well as you can?”. Now: let’s do this.</p><blockquote><p id="02bd">Slack’s preview release began two weeks after this document was sent, on August 14th, 2013. A little under six months later, on February 12th, 2014, it was officially launched. You can sign up at <a href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">slack.com</a> to begin using it and follow us on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/slackhq/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">@slackhq</a>.</p></blockquote><p id="f26a">* <em>Update: Aug 18th, 2021: I’m using the words “master” and “slave” in the specific context where one is in control (master) and the other is powerless (slave). I want to acknowledge that some readers may find the words “master” and “slave” offensive when used in this way.</em></p></div></div>

		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was in the car an hour ago, listening to an episode of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/6/23906135/today-on-the-vergecast-we-debate-what-is-a-photo-for-like-three-hours" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Vergecast</a>, and I had a sudden realization: I am a cultural outsider. An internet culture outsider to be more precise. Which is weird considering my job is to make things that live on the Internet.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t remember at which point exactly but growing up there was a moment where TV was no longer a thing at my house. We just stopped watching TV programs and that was it. For years the TV was not plugged into cable, satellite, or an antenna. It was a screen, connected to consoles and a Blu-ray or DVD player. But during that process, I slowly fell out of &#34;mainstream&#34; culture. I remember hearing people chatting about popular TV shows and having no clue about what they were talking about. To this day, I still don&#39;t know and am not familiar with the vast majority of TV celebrities. Because TV is not a thing in my life.</p>
<p>But the internet, it was different. I&#39;m spending hours upon hours of my life on the internet. I work on the internet. I create content for the internet. I became an adult with the internet. And I was sure that the internet was part of &#34;my&#34; culture. But guess what? I was wrong.</p>
<p>Listening to the podcast I couldn&#39;t stop myself from thinking &#34;What are these people even talking about?&#34;. They were talking about trends on social platforms and TV series on streaming services, and I had no idea what was going on. But now I do know. The mainstream culture moved over to the internet and I am, again, falling out of it. And I&#39;m fine with that.</p></div></div>

Guest variety from solo devs to bigger companies like Mux and Dropbox, audio editing to ensure the highest quality I could get for a remote guest&lt;-&gt;host podcast with new guests having assorted mic qualities, removing a lot of &#34;ums&#34; and other fluff but not over editing things to make it unnatural, tags to quickly find tech stacks you care about and a ton of clickable timestamps with a summary of each show that&#39;s skimmable in seconds along with tons of reference links.</p><p>On paper it feels like I did everything I could to make things &#34;good&#34;, but in practice after 100 episodes I had like 200-300 listens per episode which made it no longer viable to continue doing since each episode was about 6 hours of end to end time to put together (finding a guest, editing it, show notes, etc.).</p><p>I learned a ton from chatting with every guest and regret nothing but I overall see the podcast as a total failure since if it didn&#39;t gain any traction on it, it must be trash. I&#39;d love to revive the show because chatting with someone new about what they enjoy working on was really fun.

The stories were highly related to technology, but they usually made sense to people who knew nothing about the technology.</p><p>Even for fans of the podcast, I think the narrowness in topics means that not all fans of <i>Running in Production</i> are a match for most episodes. Comparing it to the <i>Indie Hackers</i> podcast, I&#39;d listen to any episode of IH if the guest sounds interesting because there are a lot of potential things they can say that might be useful to me. Because <i>Running in Production</i> is more narrowly about tech stacks, the percentage of episodes that are relevant to me is much smaller. I&#39;d be interested in hearing about someone talk about their Flask stack because that&#39;s what I use in my business, but if the guest is talking about Elixir or Ruby, I&#39;m unlikely to learn anything useful since I don&#39;t use or plan to use those technologies.

It&#39;s nice to hear this from the perspective of someone who was on the show.<p>I tried to make the story about going from development to production but it is for sure super focused on the technology choices that take you from A to B. There&#39;s the lessons learned which kind of apply to  any tech stack but that&#39;s also near the end of every episode so you have to listen to the whole thing to get there.</p><p>There&#39;s a number of little funny stories hidden away in some episodes. Like one guy was on vacation driving with his wife and ended up switching his web server from Apache to nginx while literally driving as a passenger.</p><p>Deployment is a tricky topic to &#34;promote&#34; because in my opinion deploying a Flask app is almost no different than Rails. If they both have a web + worker + db + cache component, it&#39;s basically the same pieces (especially if you&#39;re using Docker). The hosting provider choice, monitoring, logging, CI / CD workflows, etc. is all the same. When I went into making this show I came at it from the perspective that even if you didn&#39;t use Ruby you could still take away a few nuggets of info from a Rails episode since there&#39;s a lot of overlap but I&#39;m beginning to realize that&#39;s not how this works in real life.</p><p>What I&#39;m thinking now is maybe exactly what you said around being interested in Flask. You care about deploying a Flask app, not deploying in general.</p><p>You are right though, I have no problem sitting down and listening to a 5 hour conversation with John Carmack and Lex because I&#39;m interested in hearing John&#39;s stories. I&#39;m not there to learn the gory details about z-fail stencil shadows. I care about why he ended up inventing that and how it helped him build a cool looking game. When looking at things from that angle, that changes everything. Running in Production is like &#34;90% technical details / 10% story&#34; but &#34;80% stories / 20% technical details&#34; is a more enjoyable listen for a podcast. If this were a technical video course that would be much different, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a podcast.</p><p>Now to be fair, I did try the best I could to avoid going too deep into the technical details about a specific topic because I know most folks will doze off or lose interest because it&#39;s not relatable but still, bouncing around a bunch of technical topics at a surface level is still very tech heavy.

For most titles I tried to lead with the service name plus what they do in 70 characters or less. I tried to focus more on what the service does because I figured most folks wouldn&#39;t know what these services are, but if you know what it does it might help you relate to something in your own mind based on a rough idea of &#34;this will be about an invoicing service or an email campaign service, etc.&#34;.</p><p>But, if I do step back and reflect on my own browsing habits for not just podcasts but also YouTube. It comes down to the title. Always.</p><p>It&#39;s an interesting problem in this context. The suggestions here are to mainly make the titles optimized for humans (which I agree with too), but I&#39;m not sure if that will help with gaining traction because the site is already nearly invisible on Google and podcast sites. With that said though, after 2 years and a 100 titles in their current state, my original plan is clearly not working so I have nothing to lose to switch up that strategy. Although I&#39;m not sure if I should go back and change all of the existing titles (they are also tied into the URL on a static site, etc.).

I also suggested guests share the episode when it goes live. I tweeted out new episodes but I don&#39;t have a huge following.</p><p>Some of those posts on Reddit did pretty well.

The audio from several samples I listened to ranging from mid-run to the most recent episode were a plosive and fricative nightmare.</p><p>Is this feedback mostly on the guest&#39;s audio or my set up?</p><p>It&#39;s not my full time job but remember each guest is a different person recording their side of the track in their house or office. They&#39;re using whatever bare bones mic set up they have. I pre-assembled a list of recording suggestions before the show to avoid common issues. If money were no object I&#39;d send every guest $150-200 worth of equipment or pay to have studio time in their local area so they can record their side but that&#39;s not realistic for a podcast this size.</p><p>The most recent episode has plosives but if something clips there&#39;s not much I can do since the source audio is messed up. Everyone was recording locally, usually with Audacity to eliminate any network artifacts. Audio editing wise on my side, I usually just run their track through a noise gate while trying not to kill the natural sound of their voice. Sometimes I play a little with an EQ when it&#39;s super clear they have a very trebly voice. Often times I can&#39;t use a compressor to make their volume more consistent because they have a huge amount of room noise that can&#39;t be filtered out without making them sound non-human.</p><p>I&#39;m curious what you think about this episode&#39;s quality <a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/31-mux-is-an-api-based-platform-that-lets-you-process-and-stream-videos" rel="nofollow">https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/31-mux-is-an-api-bas...</a>. This was one where the guest ended up buying a new mic before the podcast (I suggested they pick up an AT-2005 which is a pretty low cost dynamic USB mic, it&#39;s what I use as well). They wanted a better set up for future videos on their own (not just for my show). What you hear there is mostly straight from the source.

It was surprisingly good, but definitely niche.<p>The immediate things that I noticed were the audio quality, your talking speed (often slightly too fast, especially when excited), and saying &#34;like&#34; too much.</p><p>On the plus side, very in depth conversations, great guest, and you have a good interviewing voice and style IMO.</p><p>If you wanted to revive this (which I think might be worth doing), I would work on your speech and audio first. After that you&#39;ll obviously need to figure out the product aspects of this. Marketing and presentation for one. Maybe focus on bigger technologies (languages, fields, etc) for your titles and mainline questions which can bring in the views and you can get into the details and tech stacks in the summaries and long form discussions. You need for every episode to be relevant for most listeners in some meaningful way, otherwise it&#39;s pretty difficult to retain viewers. I&#39;d say most devs aren&#39;t familiar with probably the majority of episodes. Also putting video recordings on YouTube is a must. Some people want video and it&#39;s also a great marketing channel so you&#39;re limiting yourself without that.</p><p>I do think there is something there, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll stumble on to it on accident given how niche it is already - it&#39;ll require some research and trial and error.

See if you can find a way to improve your diction.<p>Another thing, in most episodes, it seems like you have a list of questions that you want to ask, and you quickly go through them, as if you just needed to check them off the list.
And I get it, any application running in production consists of multiple pieces and involves many decisions, but just listing all of the components one by one, turns into reading the specifications on the back of a cereal box.
Maybe you could pick one or two particular aspects of the infrastructure and discuss those in greater depth. Ideally something that either you or your interviewee feel very strongly about. I&#39;d also be interesting if you challenged some of the decisions that went into the infrastructure. All too often you agree too easily with your interviewee.</p><p>Overall however, none of these should be dealbreakers. I still listened to many episodes.

Using filler words is one of those things where it&#39;s easy to notice when editing or listening to it later but near impossible to notice in the middle of a regular conversation.

Basically (:D) learning a bit about the service, team size, how it&#39;s built, how it&#39;s deployed and lessons learned. If some of these get skipped, it feels like an unfinished story that goes against the premise of the show?

Nothing wrong with that, but it&#39;s not special. If you listen to major podcasts, the people on the podcasts are highly charismatic and it&#39;s easy to listen to them talking about anything. Your podcast, on the other hand, has people who aren&#39;t particularly charismatic, just normal people talking, which I can get anywhere. Podcasts can be informative, but they are a form of entertainment, which means you have to be entertaining.<p>&#34;Devs chatting about development&#34; is also a pretty tight niche. You could probably do better than 200-300 listeners per episode, but not by much. You&#39;re creating a product very few people want. Very few people would come solely for the information being conveyed. Nothing wrong with that, but just as a podcast about European pickles would never get millions of views, no matter how good it is, neither would yours.</p><p>The audio quality was also not great, but this isn&#39;t a major issue if the podcast is entertaining.

In every episode we jumped on a call, spent a few minutes saying hello and went straight into it.</p><p>I went with my gut in that anyone volunteering to be on the show will be comfortable having a free form conversation. None of it is scripted but I do usually have a couple of bullet points in front of me to cover a range of general topics.</p><p>But, I get where you&#39;re coming from and I&#39;m like that too. I&#39;m for sure going to gravitate towards a more engaging host / guest if I had an option choosing between A and B. It&#39;s really hard to pull this off because if you only have guests on the show who have a public presence on the podcast / interview / YouTube / etc. scene it&#39;ll be much more difficult to find guests as a side project. You may also lose out on some really cool stories. In one episode a couple of guys built and shipped a custom hardware device to remote African villages to help make email more accessible.

It&#39;s almost like I went out of my way to make it sound like a sales pitch but my goal was to include their product&#39;s name and the core idea of what it does. It does feel like it&#39;s trying to optimize for SEO such as &#34;sell online courses&#34; but the content of the show has nothing to do with selling online courses, it&#39;s about chatting with one of the lead devs on how they built the platform.</p><p>An alternate title based on a topic from that episode could have been &#34;Podia survived Black Friday without breaking a sweat&#34;. If that were in a Twitter card the meta description includes it&#39;s a Rails site and it&#39;s always nice to hear success stories on how Rails does scale. It ends up have clickable interest for the skeptics out there and also Rails developers?</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/77-podia-has-everything-you-need-to-sell-online-courses" rel="nofollow">https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/77-podia-has-everyth...</a>

I do think video adds a huge element though. It also forces me to be less perfect because it&#39;s really easy to edit audio and you as the listener would never know. Most episodes have literally hundreds of cuts but you can&#39;t tell for most of them, but video is much harder to cut since you visually see the jump cuts.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion!

Niche things like this are more about _who_ is listening rather than how many people.<p>I&#39;m 100% someone interested in shows like yours, I just didn&#39;t know it existed. One major thing you could probably do right away is invite other people with followings in this area as guests. Popular podcasters are generally annoyed by requests to be on their show, but can be a lot more friendly if you invite them on yours. That&#39;s because you&#39;re doing the work and exposing them to your audience. They&#39;ll likely promote it or might even cross post it if you want to. They might have you on as a guest afterwards, someone with that many interviews is bound to have some interesting things to talk about.</p><p>The episode you posted as an example of audio quality lately seemed more than good enough for me. As far as burn out, I would maybe recommend actually doing <i>less</i> for each episode, at least until you feel like you can outsource the worst parts. What if you did only the most important parts of post, and cut down post production to an hour instead of 5 or 6? Maybe a tool that auto removes silence, umms and ahs, etc could help a bit here too. Descript for example can do a decent amount of this in about 5 minutes. Good enough in my opinion. Cut out as much post work as you can. I bet you your real audience won&#39;t care.</p><p>Part of it could also be just shorter recording times. I prefer longer episodes but it seems like I&#39;m the only one. Editing 30 mins of recording is a lot easier than an hour and a half, and people seem more likely to put on shorter episodes (I guess).</p><p>Also, just skimming a bit of an episode, I think you overdo the formality of the intro. It sounds too scripted and not like your natural self. Skipping from the intro to a later clip of you speaking, you sound much more natural later on. A lot of people will bail out during the intro if they&#39;re just checking you out for the first time and it doesn&#39;t hook them much.</p><p>The titles should reflect more of what&#39;s interesting to the audience, make it the coolest part of whatever they&#39;re doing instead of an elevator length description. Are they hitting high requests per second, doing something bleeding edge, serving a lot of users as a solo dev, etc? Combine that with the most interesting part of their stack for the title. Looking at your show notes I can see this stuff is in there, just make it the title.</p><p>If you&#39;re burning out, try being more selective with guests too. Don&#39;t force it. And don&#39;t look at it as needing X audience numbers or whatever for success. You&#39;re building authority as someone in the industry, getting respect from guests and listeners, being exposed to way more than a normal dev, and so much more. If you&#39;re trying to make a living off of the podcast, you&#39;ll need to go wayyy more generic and attention grabbing. But I say don&#39;t do that. Instead do this thing well and you&#39;ll build a name for yourself with the kinds of people who listen to things like this - people in motion, building things, who are excelling in the field. People who are or will be somebody to respect in the industry.Thats a big deal.</p><p>Finally, please keep making the show, this is a niche that I&#39;ve found surprisingly hard to find good content for. I <i>want</i> the technical details, I want the code talk and the deep dive that most podcasts cut out because &#34;people don&#39;t want to listen to this&#34;. Well, I do and so do plenty of people actually building real things.

Happy to hear you like the show.<p>I&#39;ve done a few cross-posted episodes. That wasn&#39;t the goal of those episodes but some of the episodes are with folks who either have their own podcast or are part of a group podcast. For example, the changelog episode <a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/63-changelog-is-a-news-and-podcast-platform-for-developers" rel="nofollow">https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/63-changelog-is-a-ne...</a>. There&#39;s a number of others.</p><p>I don&#39;t spend too long while editing. About 60-90 minutes of editing per episode when the episode in itself is about that long. I basically edit at 2x speed and quickly chop out the filler words. Any audio processing like cleaning up noise or basic EQ work is a few minutes. The 5-6 hours is the full end to end time from having an empty folder and no guest to a finished mp3 that&#39;s ready to be published.</p><p>The intro and outro were recorded years ago with different audio settings (it&#39;s way too muffled and bass&#39;y compared to any of the last dozens of episodes). I just pad them onto the beginning and end of each episode. They were scripted because I personally don&#39;t like long intros so I was trying to get the core essence of the show out in the least amount of time possible. I will re-record them if I pick the show back up, thanks.</p><p>Definitely going to work on the titles, at least as a homework assignment make new titles for a bunch of the previous episodes even if I don&#39;t publish them. I tried to limit each one to 70 chars or less and out of respect for the guest also wanted to include their product&#39;s name in the title.</p><p>A living would be pushing it but if you work 40-50 hours a week (which I do), dedicating nearly a full day to it is a big investment. To outsource everything properly (an editor who knows enough about the tech to pick what stays in and human vetted transcripts) would be like $300-400 per episode. That&#39;s not counting someone to go through the episodes and make clips to help promote them, that would easily be another $150-250. At 1 episode per week, even without clips that&#39;ll be ~$1,500 a month.</p><p>Getting sponsors is also tricky because it&#39;s not profitable for someone to spend $300 or even $150 per episode for an ad slot when only a few hundred people listen to it. The sponsors will only be happy if they make a return on their investment and that will require having a lot more views.</p><p>You are right though, there&#39;s a lot of ancillary benefits of having the show. That&#39;s partly why I kept going for as long as I did but I noticed that my course sales didn&#39;t really change too much during or after the podcast so I&#39;m not sure it helped get the word out on them. When I look at all of that, I think to myself that it&#39;s a failure because it didn&#39;t move the needle. The conversations were great and I value them a lot which is priceless. Although, a lot of people won&#39;t admit that money does matter. It&#39;s not my primary concern or motivation for the show but money is necessary to continue doing what you like so you can afford to continue doing it.

But then I&#39;ve also gotten hundreds of comments saying they like the way I explain things and had fun.</p><p>This podcast is different because I kind of feel like if I&#39;m doing my job correctly the guest will be speaking 98% of the time. I&#39;m there to ask thought provoking questions and hope it sparks a good response from them, then maybe I&#39;ll add a little bit of color and opinions around their answers and move on.

I hate listening to guest based podcasts where the host doesn&#39;t let their guest speak and always interrupts them with &#34;actually...&#34; type of remarks or tries to 1-up them.

I really enjoy listening to your podcast, but if I may I have some feedback:<p>* Every time your guest specializes on something low-level - like Rebecca Heineman from most recent
episode, David Shayer from last year, and others - you keep saying &#34;yeah, this is a very complicated
subject and I don&#39;t understand anything about it&#34;. Everyone has they own area of expertise, no one
knows everything - and that&#39;s OK. But when you as a host constantly put yourself down, it leaves
a very strange impression on the listener: &#34;well then, invite someone who does&#34;.</p><p>* When you do a voice over for the interview and queue interviewee responses - the whole sequence feels
doctored. It just doesn&#39;t sound as a normal conversation, more like out of context clips forced into
pre-made narrative. Again, I&#39;m not saying it _is_ out of context, it just feels that way.</p><p>Please don&#39;t take these two the wrong way, you&#39;re doing great job.</p><p>Also, I would love to support the show and you seem to have a Patreon account, but prices there
are a bit too steep for a casual listener: $6/14.50/36 per month (that&#39;s in Canadian dollars).
For example, semi-weekly Darknet Diaries has $3/7.50/14.50 tiers.</p><p>In the last episode you&#39;ve announced bonus content with Rebecca, but there&#39;s not even an announcement
on the Patreon page and it&#39;s not clear what tier would allow access to it.</p><p>Sorry for the rant, but I hope it provides outside perspective and you might find it useful.

The podcast being narrative, I&#39;ve gotten complaints about the before, but my feelig is there are so many straight interview podcasts out there. If you don&#39;t like the narration then there are lots of other alternatives.</p><p>Now, it could be that I&#39;m bad at narration. That could totally be true and probably I could improve, but it&#39;s a narrative podcast.</p><p>All content is available to all patreons. Rebecca bonus episode is not out yet. I should post more details and explanation about how that works but bonus episodes episodes come out on the 15th.</p><p>Me not knowing low level stuff is true, so im not sure about that feedback. To me I think admission of my lack of knowledge in an area is good and I&#39;d like to talk about the things I don&#39;t know or my vulnerabilities more often.</p><p>Again, maybe I do it badly, but I think its good to be ok not knowing something and asking questions about it.

I&#39;ve found good results when searching for software episodes in Algorithmic Trading, Math, Netsec, and Game Development podcasts. I also found that searching YouTube with the &gt;20 min filter helps me find podcast-like single discussions/presentations. Youtube autoplay and recommended videos are really good for me.<p>Chat With Traders Podcast has Quant traders and software engineers from time to time. Hearing technical people talk about work and answer questions to a non-technical audience is useful, because podcasts often don&#39;t have PR talk. There are exception to that, here&#39;s a 3 year old episode with Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSDk5PAJss4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSDk5PAJss4</a> <a href="https://chatwithtraders.com/?s=software" rel="nofollow">https://chatwithtraders.com/?s=software</a></p><p>DataSkeptic is an AI, data science, stats, advertising podcast I have found relatively recently. The have had multiple seasons, Seasons labeled, Ad-Tech (current), Physically Distributed, k-means, Time Series, Consensus, Interpretability, Fake News, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence. I really liked the episodes I have heard so far. <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://dataskeptic.com/</a></p><p>I also enjoy old developer conference presentations like ones from Game Developers Conference and Defcon. There are projects to put saved articles through text to speech in batches on the computer, but I have set up classic TTS on my phone instead. Not all articles will work well for conversion though.

The first 20 or so episodes, they had a segment that focused on a specific programming language, the history, application and quirks which was a fun way to learn more about coding and the different tools (languages) available. They’ve since evolved to cover more practical topics such as test driven development, AI etc. it’s a good one.<p>If you’re a python fan, Talk Python To Me is a great podcast. Covers so many topics within python from libraries, frameworks and special tools.</p><p>The thing I like about these two podcasts is that they don’t assume that their listeners are primarily web developers. Since I don’t work in the web domain, it’s been tough to find a good podcasts that cover CS more broadly.
