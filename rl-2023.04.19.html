We don&#39;t need any further documentation.</blockquote><p>But this statement is only half the truth. There are several questions that remain unanswered in the code.</p><ul><li>What are the goals of the system?</li><li>What are the non-functional requirements?</li><li>What are the architectural decisions and their arguments?</li><li>...</li></ul><p>As <a href="https://simonbrown.je/?ref=workingsoftware.dev">Simon Brown</a> has correctly pointed out:</p><blockquote>The code doesn&#39;t tell the whole story.</blockquote><p>Long story short: You should document the software architecture of your system. Take a look at the <strong>goals</strong> you should fulfil with your documentation, and you&#39;ll understand <strong>why</strong>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/technical-debt-scenario-5-the-code-documents-the-system/"><div><p>Technical Debt Scenario #5: The code documents the system.</p><p>Unfortunately, several long-time developers have left the product team. In addition, there is virtually no technical documentation for the system. Even the architectural decisions are no longer traceable. What would you do to eliminate this kind of technical debt?</p><p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/size/w256h256/2021/08/logo_small_icon_only-1.png" alt=""/><span>workingsoftware.dev</span><span>Patrick Roos</span></p></div><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497409988347-cbfaac2f0b12?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyOXx8cGxhbnxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MzIxNjQ5NzE&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt=""/></p></a><figcaption>Blog Post: Technical debt due to lack of documentation</figcaption></figure><h3 id="goals-of-software-architecture-documentation">Goals of software architecture documentation</h3><p>There are three goals that your software architecture documentation should fulfil.</p><blockquote><strong>Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding</strong></blockquote><p>Software architecture documentation should at least support the development team, for example, when a new team member starts. </p><p>Let&#39;s take the onboarding example, a new team member has a lot of questions:</p><ul><li>Where can I find an overview of the system&#39;s building blocks?</li><li>Why are you using <a href="https://angular.io/?ref=workingsoftware.dev">Angular</a> and not <a href="https://reactjs.org/?ref=workingsoftware.dev">React</a>? Why are you using <a href="https://hibernate.org/?ref=workingsoftware.dev">Hibernate</a> and not <a href="https://www.jooq.org/?ref=workingsoftware.dev">jOOQ</a>?</li><li>Where and how is the system deployed?</li><li>Are there any conventions I need to be aware of?</li></ul><p>This brings us to the first goal of software architecture documentation:</p><p><strong>Software architecture documentation creates a common understanding of the solution behind the system for various stakeholders</strong></p><p>There are usually many different stakeholders interested in different aspects of our system: Software Architects, Software Engineers, Ops, Support, Testing, POs, Project Managers, SMEs, Business Sponsors and so on.</p><p>You can create different views of your system&#39;s architecture by developing a common understanding of your system&#39;s software architecture.</p><p>With this understanding, the various stakeholders can evaluate the underlying software architecture from their perspective. </p><p>In this way, we can concretize the goal described above with the evaluation part:</p><p><strong>The documentation makes it possible to evaluate the software architecture from the perspective of the various stakeholders</strong></p><p>Software architecture documentation allows your stakeholders to judge whether the system is achieving the goal, since they often can&#39;t dive into the code. </p><p>With good architecture documentation, they can answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Does the chosen architecture fit the solution? </li><li>Is the architecture appropriate?</li></ul><p>In this way, architectural documentation often prevents other goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements from creeping in.</p><p>Let me give a practical example here. </p><p>I&#39;ve often heard from various stakeholders: &#34;<em>The system must be fast</em>.&#34;</p><p>But what does that mean?</p><p>As a software architect, you have to turn these expectations into concrete quality goals, i.e., non-functional requirements with supporting quality scenarios. You record these quality goals in the architecture documentation, which in turn helps your team to implement the solution with the agreed non-functional requirements.</p><blockquote>Software architecture documentation supports architectural work</blockquote><p><strong>Software architecture documentation supports team work</strong></p><p>Software architecture is a team effort, so it&#39;s most important that the software architecture documentation supports your team effort. </p><figure><a href="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/do-we-need-a-software-architect-in-our-agile-team/"><div><p>Do we need a software architect in our agile team?</p><p>This question often comes up in agile teams. In this blog post, we look for the answer to this question in the context of the various agile and organisational frameworks like Scrum, LeSS, SAFe, Disciplined Agile and draw a conclusion.</p><p><img src="https://www.workingsoftware.dev/content/images/size/w256h256/2021/08/logo_small_icon_only-1.png" alt=""/><span>workingsoftware.dev</span><span>Patrick Roos</span></p></div><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611843467160-25afb8df1074?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fGdhcmRlbmluZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2NDc2MzUyOTc&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt=""/></p></a><figcaption>See also this article about the role of the software architect</figcaption></figure><p>As a team member, it&#39;s important to actively know (and pass on to new team members) the goals, constraints, and non-functional requirements within the team. This information is often very important in team architecture workshops.</p><p>It&#39;s important to make understandable and comprehensible architecture decisions. Nothing is more annoying than not knowing why you decided the way you did.</p><blockquote>Software architecture documentation guides the development team in implementing new product features</blockquote><p>Documenting software architecture helps the entire development team implement the solution.</p><ul><li>What <em>constraints</em> do I need to consider?</li><li>Which <em>non-functional</em> requirements do I need to test?</li><li>Which <em>overarching</em> concepts do I need to follow?</li><li>Are there architectural decisions I need to consider when implementing a particular feature?</li></ul><p><strong>Software architecture documentation supports the communication with external stakeholders</strong></p><p>A large part of software architecture work is communication. In particular, communication with stakeholders is key to effective and focused discussion outcomes.</p><p>Good software architecture documentation supports communication with external stakeholders.

<p>In practice, computer code is constantly being transformed. At the beginning of a project, the computer code often takes the form of sketches that are gradually refined. Later, the code can be optimized or corrected, sometimes for many years.</p>
<p>Soon enough, programmers realized that they needed to not only to store files, but also to keep track of the different versions of a given file. It is no accident that we are all familiar with the fact that software is often associated with versions. It is necessary to distinguish the different versions of the computer code in order to keep track of updates.</p>
<p>We might think that after developing a new version of a software, the previous versions could be discarded. However, it is practical to keep a copy of each version of the computer code for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>A change in the code that we thought was appropriate may cause problems: we need to be able to go back quickly.</li>
<li>Sometimes different versions of the computer code are used at the same time and it is not possible for all users to switch to the latest version. If an error is found in a previous version of the computer code, it may be necessary for the programmer to go back and correct the error in an earlier version of the computer code without changing the current code. In this scenario, the evolution of the software is not strictly linear. It is therefore possible to release version 1.0, followed by version 2.0, and then release version 1.1.</li>
<li>It is sometimes useful to be able to go back in time to study the evolution of the code in order to understand the motivation behind a section of code. For example, a section of code may have been added without much comment to quickly fix a new bug. The attentive programmer will be able to better understand the code by going back and reading the changes in context.</li>
<li>Computer code is often modified by different programmers working at the same time. In such a social context, it is often useful to be able to quickly determine who made what change and when. For example, if a problem is caused by a segment of code, we may want to question the programmer who last worked on that segment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Programmers quickly realized that they needed version control systems. The basic functions that a version control system provides are rollback and a history of changes made. Over time, the concept version control has spread. There are even several variants intended for the general public such as DropBox where various files, not only computer code, are stored.</p>
<p>The history of software version control tools dates back to the 1970s (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1975.6312866">Rochkind, 1975</a>). In 1972, Rochkind developed the SCCS (Source Code Control System) at Bell Laboratories. This system made it possible to create, update and track changes in a software project. SCCS remained a reference from the end of the 1970s until the 1980s. One of the constraints of SCCS is that it does not allow collaborative work: only one person can modify a given file at a given time.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Tichy proposed the RCS (Revision Control System), which innovated with respect to SCCS by storing only the differences between the different versions of a file in backward order, starting from the latest file. In contrast, SCCS stored differences in forward order starting from the first version. For typical use where we access the latest version, RCS is faster.</p>
<p>In programming, we typically store computer code within text files. Text files most often use ASCII or Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-16) encoding. Lines are separated by a sequence of special characters that identify the end of a line and the beginning of a new line. Two characters are often used for this purpose: “carriage return” (CR) and “line feed” (LF). In ASCII and UTF-8, these characters are represented with the byte having the value 13 and the byte having the value 10 respectively. In Windows, the sequence is composed of the CR character followed by the LF character, whereas in Linux and macOS, only the LF character is used. In most programming languages, we can represent these two characters with the escape sequences \r and \n respectively. So the string “a\nb\nc” has three lines in most programming languages under Linux or macOS: the lines “a”, “b” and “c”.</p>
<p>When a text file is edited by a programmer, usually only a small fraction of all lines are changed. Some lines may also be inserted or deleted. It is convenient to describe the differences as succinctly as possible by identifying the new lines, the deleted lines and the modified lines.</p>
<p>The calculation of differences between two text files is often done first by breaking the text files into lines. We then treat a text file as a list of lines. Given two versions of the same file, we want to associate as many lines in the first version as possible with an identical line in the second version. We also assume that the order of the lines is not reversed.</p>
<p>We can formalize this problem by looking for the longest common subsequence. Given a list, a subsequence simply takes a part of the list, excluding some elements. For example, (a,b,d) is a subsequence of the list (a,b,c,d,e). Given two lists, we can find a common subsequence, e.g. (a,b,d) is a subsequence of the list (a,b,c,d,e) and the list (z,a,b,d). The longest common subsequence between two lists of text lines represents the list of lines that have not been changed between the two versions of a text file. It might be difficult to solve this program using brute force. Fortunately, we can compute the longest common subsequence by dynamic programming. Indeed, we can make the following observations.</p>
<ol>
<li>If we have two strings with a longest subsequence of length k, and we add at the end of each of the two strings the same character, the new strings will have a longer subsequence of length k+1.</li>
<li>If we have two strings of lengths m and n, ending in distinct characters (for example, “abc” and “abd”), then the longest subsequence of the two strings is the longest subsequence of the two strings after removing the last character from one of the two strings. In other words, to determine the length of the longest subsequence between two strings, we can take the maximum of the length of the subsequence after amputating one character from the first string while keeping the second unchanged, and the length of the subsequence after amputating one character from the second string while keeping the first unchanged.<br/>
These two observations are sufficient to allow an efficient calculation of the length of the longest common subsequence. It is sufficient to start with strings comprising only the first character and to add progressively the following characters. In this way, one can calculate all the longest common subsequences between the truncated strings. It is then possible to reverse this process to build the longest subsequence starting from the end. If two strings end with the same character, we know that the last character will be part of the longest subsequence. Otherwise, one of the two strings is cut off from its last character, making our choice in such a way as to maximize the length of the longest common subsequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following function illustrates a possible solution to this problem. Given two arrays of strings, the function returns the longest common subsequence. If the first string has length <code>m</code> and the second <code>n</code>, then the algorithm runs in <code>O(m*n)</code> time.</p>

<p>Once the subsequence has been calculated, we can quickly calculate a description of the difference between the two text files. Simply move forward in each of the text files, line by line, stopping as soon as you reach a position corresponding to an element of the longest sub-sequence. The lines that do not correspond to the subsequence in the first file are considered as having been deleted, while the lines that do not correspond to the subsequence in the second file are considered as having been added. The following function illustrates a possible solution.</p>

The function we propose as an illustration for computing the longest subsequence uses <code>O(m*n)</code> memory elements. It is possible to reduce the memory usage of this function and simplify it (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/360825.360861">Hirschberg, 1975</a>). Several other improvements are possible in practice (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.4380151102">Miller and Myers, 1985</a>). We can then represent the changes between the two files in a concise way.</p>
<p>Suggested reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">article Diff (wikipedia)</a></p>
<p>Like SCCS, RCS does not allow multiple programmers to work on the same file at the same time. The need to own a file to the exclusion of all other programmers while working on it may have seemed a reasonable constraint at the time, but it can make the work of a team of programmers much more cumbersome.</p>
<p>In 1986 Grune developed the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Unlike previous systems, CVS allows multiple programmers to work on the same file simultaneously. It also adopts a client-server model that allows a single directory to be present on a network, accessible by multiple programmers simultaneously. The programmer can work on a file locally, but as long as he has not transmitted his version to the server, it remains invisible to the other developers.</p>
<p>The remote server also serves as a de facto backup for the programmers. Even if all the programmers’ computers are destroyed, it is possible to start over with the code on the remote server.</p>
<p>In a version control system, there is usually always a single latest version. All programmers make changes to this latest version. However, such a linear approach has its limits. An important innovation that CVS has updated is the concept of a branch. A branch allows to organize sets of versions that can evolve in parallel. In this model, the same file is virtually duplicated. There are then two versions of the file (or more than two) capable of evolving in parallel. By convention, there is usually one main branch that is used by default, accompanied by several secondary branches. Programmers can create new branches whenever they want. Branches can then be merged: if a branch A is divided into two branches (A and B) which are modified, it is then possible to bring all the modifications into a single branch (merging A and B). The branch concept is useful in several contexts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some software development is speculative. For example, a programmer may explore a new approach without being sure that it is viable. In such a case, it may be better to work in a separate branch and merge with the main branch only if successful.</li>
<li>The main branch may be restricted to certain programmers for security reasons. In such a case, programmers with reduced access may be restricted to separate branches. A programmer with privileged access may then merge the secondary branch after a code inspection.</li>
<li>A branch can be used to explore a particular bug and its fix.</li>
<li>A branch can be used to update a previous version of the code. Such a version may be kept up to date because some users depend on that earlier version and want to receive certain fixes. In such a case, the secondary branch may never be integrated with the main branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the drawbacks of CVS is poor performance when projects include multiple files and multiple versions. In 2000, Subversion (SVN) was proposed as an alternative to CVS that meets the same needs, but with better performance.</p>
<p>CVS and Subversion benefit from a client-server approach, which allows multiple programmers to work simultaneously with the same version directory. Yet programmers often want to be able to use several separate remote directories.</p>
<p>To meet these needs, various “distributed version control systems” (DVCS) have been developed. The most popular one is probably the Git system developed by Torvalds (2005). Torvalds was trying to solve a problem of managing Linux source code. Git became the dominant version management tool.<br/>
tool. It has been adopted by Google, Microsoft, etc. It is free software.</p>
<p>In a distributed model, a programmer who has a local copy of the code can synchronize it with either one directory or another. They can easily create a new copy of the remote directory on a new server. Such flexibility is considered essential in many complex projects such as the Linux operating system kernel.</p>
<p>Several companies offer Git-based services including GitHub. Founded in 2008, GitHub has tens of millions of users. In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion.</p>
<p>For CVS and Subversion, there is only one set of software versions. With a distributed approach, multiple sets can coexist on separate servers. The net result is that a software project can evolve differently, under the responsibility of different teams, with possible future reconciliation.</p>
<p>In this sense, Git is distributed. Although many users rely on GitHub (for example), your local copy can be attached to any remote directory, and it can even be attached to multiple remote directories. The verb “clone” is sometimes used to describe the recovery of a Git project locally, since it is a complete copy of all files, changes, and branches.</p>
<p>If a copy of the project is attached to another remote directory, it is called a fork. We often distinguish between branches and forks. A branch always belongs to the main project. A fork is originally a complete copy of the project, including all branches. It is possible for a fork to rejoin the main project, but it is not essential.</p>
<p>Given a publicly available Git directory, anyone can clone it and start working on it and contributing to it. We can create a new fork. From a fork, we can submit a pull request that invites people to integrate our changes. This allows a form of permissionless innovation. Indeed, it becomes possible to retrieve the code, modify it and propose a new version without ever having to interact directly with the authors.</p>
<p>Systems like CVS and subversion could become inefficient and take several minutes to perform certain operations. Git, in contrast, is generally efficient and fast, even for huge projects. Git is robust and does not get “corrupted” easily. However, it is not recommended to use Git for huge files such as multimedia content: Git’s strength lies in text files. It should be noted that the implementation of Git has improved over time and includes sophisticated indexing techniques.</p>
<p>Git is often used on the command line. It is possible to use graphical clients. Services like GitHub make Git a little easier.</p>
<p>The basic logical unit of Git is the <code>commit</code>, which is a set of changes to multiple files. A <code>commit</code> includes a reference to at least one parent, except for the first <code>commit</code> which has no parent. A single <code>commit</code> can be the parent of several children: several branches can be created from a <code>commit</code> and each subsequent <code>commit</code> becomes a <code>child</code> of the initial <code>commit</code>. Furthermore, when several branches are merged, the resulting <code>commit</code> will have several parents. In this sense, the <code>commits</code> form an “acyclic directed graph”.</p>
<p>With Git, we want to be able to refer to a <code>commit</code> in an easy way, using a unique identifier. That is, we want to have a short numeric value that corresponds to one <code>commit</code> and one <code>commit</code> only. We could assign each <code>commit</code> a version number (1.0, 2.0, etc.). Unfortunately, such an approach is difficult to reconcile with the fact that <code>commits</code> do not form a linear chain where a <code>commit</code> has one and only one parent. As an alternative, we use a hash function to compute the unique identifier. A hash function takes elements as parameters and calculates a numerical value (hash value). There are several simple hash functions. For example, we can iterate over the bytes contained in a message from a starting value <code>h</code>, by computing <code>h = 31 * h + b</code> where <code>b</code> is the byte value. For example, a message containing bytes 3 and 4 might have a hash value of <code>31 * (31 * 3) + 4</code> if we start <code>h = 0</code>. Such a simple approach is effective in some cases, but it allows malicious users to create collisions: it would be possible to create a fake <code>commit</code> that has the same hash value and thus create security holes. For this reason, Git uses more sophisticated hashing techniques (SHA-1, SHA-256) developed by cryptographic specialists. Commits are identified using a hash value (for example, the hexadecimal numeric value 921103db8259eb9de72f42db8b939895f5651489) which is calculated from the date and time, the comment left by the programmer, the user’s name, the parents and the nature of the change. In theory, two <code>commits</code> could have the same hash value, but this is an unlikely event given the hash functions used by Git. It’s not always practical to reference a hexadecimal code. To make things easier, Git allows you to identify a commit with a label (e.g., v1.0.0). The following command will do: <code>git tag -a v1.0.0 -m &#34;version 1.0.0&#34;</code>.</p>
<p>Though tags can be any string, tags often contain sequences of numbers indicating a version. There is no general agreement among programmers on how  to attribute version numbers to a version. However, tags sometimes take the form of three numbers separated by dots: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (for example, 1.2.3). With each new version, 1 is added to at least one of the three numbers. The first number often starts at 1 while the next two start at 0.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first number (MAJOR) must be increased when you make major changes to the code. The other two numbers (MINOR and PATCH) are often reset to zero. For example, you can go from version 1.2.3 to version 2.0.0.</li>
<li>The second number (MINOR) is increased for minor changes (for example, adding a function). When increasing the second number, the first number (MAJOR) is usually kept unchanged and the last number (PATCH) is reset to zero.</li>
<li>The last number (PATCH) is increased when fixing bugs. The other two numbers are not increased.<br/>
There are finer versions of this convention like “<a href="https://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Git, the programmer can have a local copy of the commit graph. They can add new <code>commits</code>. In a subsequent step, the programmer must “push” his changes to a remote directory so that the changes become visible to other programmers. The other programmers can fetch the changes using a `pull’.</p>
<p>Git has advanced collaborative features. For example, the <code>git blame</code> command lets you know who last modified a given piece of code.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Version control in computing is a sophisticated approach that has benefited from many years of work. It is possible to store multiple versions of the same file at low cost and navigate from one version to another quickly.</p>
<p>If you develop code without using a version control tool like Git or the equivalent, you are bypassing proven practices. It’s likely that if you want to work on complex projects with multiple programmers, your productivity will be much lower without version control.</p>

Sometimes it hurts; it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you.” Over his 15 or so years on television, Bourdain took Americans to places they were unlikely to go and introduced them to people they were unlikely to meet. At his best, he stripped away the filters that a superpower imposes on the world—good and evil, victor and victim—and found an essential humanity that we all share. In a time when social media elevates bombastic voices certain of their righteousness, Bourdain offered ambiguity that was somehow reassuring: It’s possible, his shows suggested, to look honestly at the world’s diversity, complexity, and occasional depravity, and be better for it.</p><p>Americans tend to reserve a place in the culture for a particular kind of man (and it’s almost always a man) who makes his own way: the self-destructive striver who succeeds outside the lines of any recognized rule book or established convention. All the better to have overcome adversity. Bourdain is at once a familiar and unlikely addition to that category. A former heroin and crack addict and celebrity chef who wasn’t particularly noteworthy as a cook, he vaulted into the popular imagination as a writer in 2000 with <a href="http://https://bookshop.org/a/12476/0060899220"><i>Kitchen Confidential</i></a>, a gonzo-journalism trip through 20 or so years working in kitchens. He excelled as a celebrity, ready with a provocative quip and projecting a bemused demeanor that winked at the audience when he was the guest of some gossip journalist or overcaffeinated talk-show host: <i>We all know these people are full of shit</i>. And yet he went on to produce earnest and searching television shows, taking audiences everywhere from West Virginia to the Democratic Republic of Congo, finding a unique voice and a form of expression that managed to break through the incessant noise of our culture.</p><p>Americans also have a morbid fascination with famous people who die by suicide. Perhaps such a death speaks to a gnawing sense that there is a spiritual void at the epicenter of the capitalistic American dream: You can have it all and still be miserable. Since Bourdain died in a hotel room in Alsace, France, in 2018, there’s been something of a tug-of-war about how to remember him. Do we focus on the rich body of work that showed us the virtues of boundless curiosity and human resilience? Or do we obsess over the mystery of why the same person who showed us all those things ultimately said no to his own life? How do we reconcile the endless journey Anthony Bourdain took us on with the sad destination that it reached?</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/06/remembering-anthony-bourdain/562388/">Read: Remembering Anthony Bourdain</a></p><p>The tragic irony of Bourdain’s life and death is that the same interior darkness he succumbed to enabled the alchemy that he performed, again and again, on television: showing us three-dimensional human beings doing their best against often insurmountable odds. Recognizing this, I originally became fixated on Bourdain’s shows during the insomnia of my later years working in the Obama White House. My obsession only deepened after Donald Trump’s election, which led to the destruction of so many things that were important to me. Here was someone who wasn’t offering false optimism or mindless distraction. No matter where they were, the characters Bourdain introduced us to seemed to be searching imperfectly for the same simple things: community, authenticity, and integrity. It made me feel less alone.</p><p>I<span>n </span><a href="http://https://bookshop.org/a/12476/1982140445"><i><span>Down and Out in Paradise:</span> The Life of Anthony Bourdain</i></a>, Charles Leerhsen chooses to view Bourdain chiefly through the lens of his suicide. Throughout the book, different aspects of Bourdain’s life and personality are cast as foreshadowing his end: his rage against his middle-class New Jersey upbringing; a controlling mother and a father whose life ended in failure; an addictive personality and that self-destructive darkness; a yearning to be loved and a discomfort with those who loved him. The story works its way to a seemingly inevitable ending, punctuated by text messages exchanged by Bourdain and Asia Argento, the Italian actor who Leerhsen believes broke Bourdain’s obsessive heart. After seeing her in paparazzi photos with another man, Bourdain begged her to acknowledge his suffering and jealousy. “I can’t believe you have so little affection or respect for me that you would be without empathy for this,” he wrote. A day later, he was dead.</p><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="Down And Out In Paradise - The Life Of Anthony Bourdain"><a href="https://web.tertulia.com/book/9781982140441?affiliate=atl-347" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="Down And Out In Paradise - The Life Of Anthony Bourdain" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/VtSCyp3o3QDwaE80wecgrQFjZEA=/0x0:334x500/80x120/media/img/book_reviews/2022/11/28/41SdgzdzmOL._SL500_/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ieWSfKFPFkCCXiM59Y3xwJMqcHw=/0x0:334x500/160x240/media/img/book_reviews/2022/11/28/41SdgzdzmOL._SL500_/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/VtSCyp3o3QDwaE80wecgrQFjZEA=/0x0:334x500/80x120/media/img/book_reviews/2022/11/28/41SdgzdzmOL._SL500_/original.jpg" width="80" height="120"/></picture></a></div><p>By ending on the texts, Leerhsen gives in to salaciousness, undermining what is otherwise a stylized and exhaustively researched celebrity biography. A former editor at <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, Leerhsen has the magazine writer’s ability to put us inside the life of a famous person: “Shadowy figures in tenement doorways? <i>Perfect!</i> This is how Tony, in 1981, wanted to lose his heroin virginity.” He also makes the interesting choice to focus on Bourdain’s early years, before we knew him. This is a gritty contrast to other recent Bourdain books and documentaries that lean heavily on the proud production-company and celebrity collaborators of his later years—which Leerhsen dismissively refers to as “Bourdain Inc.”</p><p>Whether you are a Bourdain fan or a relative newcomer to his story, you’ll come away with a better understanding of what made the man. Yet sometimes he comes across as a bit too intent on cutting Bourdain down to a more manageable life size. We learn, for instance, that he didn’t invite some of his high-school friends over to his house, and we get a full reproduction of one of his bad college poems. Of the latter, we are offered the judgment of a poet consulted by Leerhsen: “A poem trying too hard to be a poem.”</p><p>That may, in fact, be an apt, if unintentional, summary of Bourdain’s own stubborn determination to turn himself into an extraordinary man. He could, as Leerhsen reminds us, be insecure and act like a jerk. But he was also a serious enthusiast—for food, music, movies, and writing—who searched for decades for a way to measure up to the 20th-century American-male archetype he admired: a reckless and charismatic man like Hunter S. Thompson or Marlon Brando. Like his heroes, he strove to transcend the afflictions that Leerhsen details, and succeed on his own terms amid the sanitized and profit-hungry landscape of American culture. And after a middling career as a chef and one-off success as a memoirist, Bourdain, remarkably, found his outlet on an unlikely 21st-century medium: as a travel television host.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/06/what-anthony-bourdain-understood-about-authenticity/562448/">Read: What Anthony Bourdain understood about authenticity</a></p><p>Leerhsen gets how Bourdain’s vices and neuroses helped him forge a bond with his audience. “It was comforting,” he writes, “for viewers to realize that the coolest-seeming guy in the world didn’t actually have life licked.” But Leerhsen is less successful at taking the next step: conveying how—or why—this sort of guy, damaged in many ways, someone who had never really traveled much before hosting a television series, ended up showing us so much. Bourdain brought the eyes and heart of an enthusiast everywhere he went, and he maintained a deep well of empathy for people who, like him, found it hard to reconcile what they loved about the world with what they didn’t.</p><p>Leerhsen tells us how Bourdain asked market-obsessed television executives to basically let him do whatever he wanted on camera. “That turned out to be a winning formula,” he writes, “and it left Tony with the distinct impression that, as he more than once said, ‘Not giving a shit is a really fantastic business model for television.’” That very much misses the point. Sure, in his earlier years on television, a big part of the allure was watching this tall, gangly American swear, eat a still-beating cobra heart, and drink to excess. But as his shows went on, Bourdain most definitely <i>did</i> give a shit. He had a knack for going to places that were along geopolitical fault lines. He exposed us to the emerging excesses of Chinese consumption years before Xi Jinping assumed power, took us to a Libya poised between the fall of Muammar Qaddafi and a descent into a second civil war, invited us to dinner with the Russian oppositionist Boris Nemtsov about a year before he was assassinated, and showed us countries in the global South struggling to find an identity despite the rampant inequality and unaccountable governments that remain a legacy of European colonialism and American adventurism.</p><p>In doing so, Bourdain often seemed to wrestle with what it meant to be American, which gave him so much opportunity while filling him with so much unease. In Laos, for instance, he eats with a man who has lost limbs to the unexploded ordnance left behind by America’s not-so-secret war. Bourdain is asked if he’s afraid to see the consequences of what his government did. “Afraid? No,” he responds. “Every American should see the results of war … I think it’s the least I can do, to see the world with open eyes.” At that moment, as in so many other Bourdain shows, this individual’s story is granted the same importance as the stories of people who usually appear on television—political figures, for instance, or celebrity chefs. This was his most subversive attribute, and he usually wasn’t preachy about it. On camera, he was just curious and willing to listen. And we could see—in real time—how the journey was changing him.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/07/roadrunner-anthony-bourdain/619557/">Read: The missing pieces of Anthony Bourdain</a></p><p>That’s what is interesting, and lasting, about Bourdain. What’s missing in this new biography is the possibility that the dark backstory Leehrsen tells contributed not just to Bourdain’s suicide but to his <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/06/anthony-bourdains-extreme-empathy/562454/">unusual empathy</a>: Having known the rock bottom of heroin and crack addiction, the dislocation of not fitting in or feeling comfortable, perhaps Bourdain was better equipped to really <i>see</i> people struggling against forces that were too big for them to control.</p><p>In the end, that’s also what is most disturbing about his suicide. Leehrsen has an eye for the devastating detail. And to me, the most devastating of all is the fact that Bourdain had an “as-it-happens” Google alert for his own name, and that he spent the final hours of his life Googling <i>Asia Argento</i> hundreds of times, presumably staring at the same paparazzi photos over and over. How sad it is that Bourdain, who offered the promise of escape from the mundane social-media addictions of our time, spent his last days triggering himself while staring at screens. After a life of exploration, his last journey was down an online rabbit hole about his own failed romance.</p><p>Precisely because of the empathy he showed for his subjects, Anthony Bourdain the storyteller would have understood that his own life was bigger and more complex than how it ended. Like the archetypical American men he sought to emulate, he was able to find a voice that rebelled against convention and discovered something redemptive in the stories he told. For a time, he was able to outrun his own past and the weight of his celebrity. Until he couldn’t. As with travel, it’s up to us to decide what to take away from it all.</p><div><hr/><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
