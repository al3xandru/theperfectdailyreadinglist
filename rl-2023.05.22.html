<p id="p2"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tripsy-travel-planner/id1429967544" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tripsy</a> is more than just an app for storing details about your upcoming trips. It does that and does it well, but it’s also a great way to revisit old trips and get inspired about places you want to visit in the future. We’ve covered Tripsy before, so for more on what the app can do, I recommend checking out our reviews of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tripsy-2-1-adds-web-based-itineraries-and-expanded-travel-email-forwarding/" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 2.10</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tripsy-review-the-ultimate-trip-planner-for-iphone-and-ipad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 1.0</a>. With version 2.15, which debuted this week, Tripsy is focused on trip itineraries, adding several ‘quality of life’ features along with better organization for multi-location trips, and improved customization.</p>


<p id="p5">Nothing can spoil a trip activity you’ve planned like bad weather. Tripsy’s update adds a 10-day forecast for your destination inside your itinerary. That way, if bad weather is on the horizon, it’s easier to adjust your plans. You’ll find the forecast for each location at the beginning of each day of your itinerary, with an icon showing the predicted conditions alongside the forecast minimum and maximum temperatures. Temperatures are displayed in the units selected in the Settings app by default, but can be changed in your itinerary’s settings.</p>

<p id="p7">When you’re traveling, it’s also easier than usual to get tripped up by time zones. Tripsy’s update deals with those changes for each location of a trip by showing how many hours ahead or behind your destination is from your starting point. Tapping the time zone entry in your itinerary pulls up a card interface with your current time zone and last time zone, with the time indicated for both.</p>
<p id="p8">Tripsy also numbers the days of your trips using ‘1st,’ ‘2nd,’ ‘3rd,’ and so on, which I like because it’s how I think of a multi-day trip when I’m planning it. Also, if you’re going to be in more than one location during your trip, Tripsy will organize your lists of activities by location, making it easier to find the restaurant or other activity at a glance.</p>

<p id="p10">Flight information has been expanded, too, with takeoff and landing times along with terminal and gate information. Plus, if you’ve got a connection to make, your itinerary will show you how long you’ll be at the airport and the city you’re in. Tripsy’s flight data won’t replace a dedicated app like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flighty-live-flight-tracker/id1358823008" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flighty</a> for people who want every possible detail about their flights, but it does fill an important gap, offering a more complete picture of your plans than before. Tripsy has also added a button to the map for your next itinerary activity that will generate directions using Apple Maps, Google Maps, Uber, Waze, Lyft, or CityMapper.</p>

<p id="p12">Finally, it’s worth noting that you can turn off these new itinerary data points can be turned off if you prefer. There are options to turn off some of the information included on your trip’s separate dashboard too.</p>
<hr id="hr13"/><p id="p14">I don’t currently have a trip planned, so my testing of Tripsy’s new features was for imaginary trips. Although the testing environment was artificial, I expect the app will hold up well under real-world use. I’ve used Tripsy for a lot of my past travels and love it because it’s the sort of app that keeps getting better with each iteration. This week’s update is no exception. Version 2.15 focuses on the fundamentals, providing a meaningful improvement to the itinerary for your next trip.</p>
<p id="p15">Tripsy 2.15 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tripsy-travel-planner/id1429967544" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available as a free update on the App Store</a>. Some features, including weather forecasts and time zone support, are only available to subscribers to Tripsy Pro.</p>

<p>Soon, you won’t need to write much anymore. Artificial Intelligence will do it for you. With all the free time we will have, we could try to rethink how we learn, work, and how we communicate.</p>
<p>You’ve heard the news. Microsoft bought 49% of OpenAI. Soon, ChatGPT will become the centerpiece of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. The majority of business matters are written in MS Office. AI will make its heart beat.</p>
<p>As an employee, your job will be reduced to barking a couple of fuzzy commands, from time to time. ChatGPT will read, think and write for you. It’s only a matter of time, until ChatGPT graduates from Office to Windows itself, runs the whole system, and makes the idea of apps look as old-fashioned as cassette tapes.<sup id="fnref-14041-*"><a href="#fn-14041-*" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> Did Microsoft really think this through?</p>
<p>Sooner than later, Artificial Intelligence will get rid of Windows, too, yeah, forget laptops, desktops, and monitors… Artificial Intelligence will run everything from a phone, or a watch, or, scratch that, a precious little finger ring. AI will do everything for you in a galaxy of clouds far, far away, through an ultra-light client in slightly over 12 parsecs.</p>
<h2>It looks like the road to Heaven…<sup id="fnref-14042-**"><a href="#fn-14042-**" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup></h2>
<p>AI has the power to radically change society, streamlining business processes, market communication, and challenging traditional hierarchies.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The end of apps and your 99 subscriptions:</em> If ChatGPT is the centerpiece of all apps, you don’t need them, you just need a couple of plugins that render your processed barks.</li>
<li><em>The end of business communication:</em> If no one writes or reads emails, Slacks, or Trellos anymore, we might as well stop sending them altogether.</li>
<li><em>The end of bosses:</em> If everyone uses the same brain, we don’t need anyone telling us what to do. </li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of typing boring requests in Outlook, instead of cropping stock imagery and power pointing the newest Lego-block business-clichés, instead of braining up Word memos that no one will read, you can give your computer a couple of approximate orders and the machine processes the text for you. Working on a screen has never been this easy. So… take it easy. It was all bullshit anyways. AI will catapult the existing business circus into a Spaceballs dimension.</p>
<p>The briefings, meetings, memos, proposals, timesheets and invoices, the deliverables, code and code reviews, the marketing campaigns, and analytics… <em>Work on the screen has all been a simulation of itself before AI started simulating them.</em> Time to leave the simulation of simulations to the machines. Let <em>them</em> print money while <em>you</em> focus on things that matter.</p>
<h2>…but it could be the road to hell</h2>
<p>In a darker corner of the same future, machines simulating work, individuality, and the recognition of language’s limitations challenge the necessity of traditional income, personal identity, and verbal communication as a whole.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The end of income:</em> What do we need work for when a machine simulates work better than yourself? </li>
<li><em>The end of you:</em> What do we need <em>you</em> for when a machine simulates <em>you</em> better than yourself? </li>
<li><em>The end of language:</em> If we all know that language is not real, we don’t need to speak anymore. </li>
</ul>
<p>If no one understands what no one thought, and no one reads what no one has written, we may as well abolish the whole circus of language and enjoy the silence. Wouldn’t it be nice? Jokes aside, it looks like AI devalues all productivity apps, not just the Office Suite, but work on the computer is getting superfluous.<sup id="fnref-14043-**"><a href="#fn-14043-**" title="Read footnote.">3</a></sup> Screenwork has been hit by a Weimar scale inflation.</p>
<h2>Time to Think and Rethink</h2>
<p>If artificial intelligence frees us from business as usual, what will we do with all our free time? Play chess? Paint in oil? Compose symphonies? Read a printed book? Write on paper? Maybe we do nothing. Maybe we just take it easy. Or maybe it’s time to get real, think, and rethink what we know, what we do, what we aim at and who we are.<sup id="fnref-14044-**"><a href="#fn-14044-**" title="Read footnote.">4</a></sup></p>
<h3>What can we know?</h3>
<p>AI has made clear that, to a large degree, we all simulate knowledge and meaning. <em>AI is so good at simulating school and business language because a lot of our own understanding in both spheres is largely simulated.</em> </p>
<h3>What should we do?</h3>
<p>It has become a lot easier to program, market, learn and write content. It has become a lot easier to simulate understanding. </p>
<p>Now, you can let Artificial Intelligence do boring tasks for you. You can let it speak for you, when you don’t care that much. Independent, of what you allow it to do, it can’t think and feel for you. So as a guideline, you probably shouldn’t let AI take decisions for you. In contrary, using AI you need to think harder, deeper, clearer. You have more time now, so use it to do what the machine cannot. Use them reasonably. Know what you say. Question your understanding.</p>
<p>We need to rethink ourselves—and we need to observe AI. And we need to observe it now, as it still makes obvious mistakes and reveals through its bugs how it works. Once it simulates us perfectly, we won’t understand it at all anymore. We won’t be able to discern it from us and understand how it works. </p>
<p>Right now, AI acts like cancer. It grows uncontrolled out of our organic knowledge, and it grows where that organic knowledge already has developed some carcinogenic tissue. Visually, AI generated pictures look carcinogenic. The current Dall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion pictures do not look healthy, meaningful, and happy. It’s one dark horror show of stuff growing out of what used to be organic. Soon this will change and AI-engineers will learn to simulate happy images. </p>
<h3>What can we hope?</h3>
<p>We need to rethink how we spend our free time. AI will have eaten all our hobbies long before it fired us from our job. It beat Kasparov at chess 25 years ago. It doesn’t beat Bach at composing, Picasso at painting, or Shakespeare at writing—but it already makes it easy for a hobbyist to simulate them. Why resist? AI will blur the lines.</p>
<p>Our life goal goal cannot be to finish our meaningless work quickly and then do something imperfect but meaningful in our free time. </p>
<p>Why would you believe that you, my out-simulated human fellow, are able to find meaning in anything? Do you think people will care about your faulty endeavors just because you are human? How are you human if you leave understanding reading, thinking, writing, caring, and loving to a processor? </p>
<p>If you give up on thinking for yourself, on asking yourself, if you mean what you say, feel what you thought, if you give up on understanding, you become a machine. As the machines start out simulating us in almost every aspect, is more likely that we become machines than that machines become human.</p>
<h3>What does it mean to be human?</h3>
<p>To not get sucked into that black hole too soon, let’s shine a light on the idea of human language. Language connects us. Language connects one human being to another. Through space and time. Language transports meaning between minds, sense between bodies, it can make us understand each other and ourselves. It can make us feel what others feel. Language is a bridge.</p>
<p>If we disconnect one side of the bridge, the bridge falls. If one listener or speaker, writer, or reader stops feeling what is said, the bridge crumbles. Language without a body is senseless, meaningless, void. As the machines start outdoing us technically, let’s not forget the almost unspeakable beauty of understanding each other.</p>
