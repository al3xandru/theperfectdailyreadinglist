		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>S</span><span>eeing cars</span>​ with no human inside move through San Francisco’s streets is eerie enough as a pedestrian, but when I’m on my bicycle I often find myself riding alongside them, and from that vantage point you catch the ghostly spectacle of a steering wheel turning without a hand. Since August, driverless cars have been available as taxis hailed through apps but I more often see empty cars than ones with backseat passengers. These robots in the shape of cars don’t move like those with human drivers. While I waited next to one at a busy intersection, the vehicle first halted at the yellow light, then rolled into the intersection, where it stopped when the light turned red, confounding the traffic around it.</p><p>Still, I’ve become somewhat used to driverless cars in the years they’ve been training on the city’s streets, first with back-up human drivers, and then without. They are here despite opposition from city officials, including the fire chief, and San Francisco recently sued the California state bureau that gave companies licence to use the streets as their laboratory. Firefighters have reported driverless cars attempting to park on firehoses; last June one such car prevented emergency vehicles from reaching victims of a shooting; the vehicles are apparently unequipped to assess these situations and respond by stopping. Direct communication isn’t an option: the only way to get a driverless car to do anything is to contact the company in charge of it.</p><p>In early October, a driverless car owned by Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, hit a woman who’d just been struck by another car, and in the course of performing what was described as a rote ‘pullover manoeuvre’ dragged her twenty feet, mangling her badly and leaving her trapped under its wheels. The device was unable to detect that it was on top of a human and would not respond to rescuers, who had to lift the car off her. Cruise withdrew its 950 driverless vehicles, but Waymo, a company launched by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, continues to send its cars onto the streets.</p><p>Driverless cars are often called autonomous vehicles – but driving isn’t an autonomous activity. It’s a co-operative social activity, in which part of the job of whoever’s behind the wheel is to communicate with others on the road. Whether on foot, on my bike or in a car, I engage in a lot of hand gestures – mostly meaning ‘wait!’ or ‘go ahead!’ – when I’m out and about, and look for others’ signals. San Francisco Airport has signs telling people to make eye contact before they cross the street outside the terminals. There’s no one in a driverless car to make eye contact with, to see you wave or hear you shout or signal back. The cars do use their turn signals – but they don’t always turn when they signal.</p><p>The rationales for the introduction of driverless cars include eliminating human error and allowing people with disabilities to get about without having to rely on other human beings. A more convincing rationale is that the corporations which own them can keep income that would otherwise have gone on drivers’ wages. Automation has, of course, been a way to increase owners’ profits since the Luddites protested against mechanical looms. Airports have self check-ins; supermarkets have self check-outs; roads and bridges have, in place of toll-takers, technology that reads your licence plate. Customer service phone numbers connect you to digital operatives and a host of other automated systems.</p><p>This takes a toll. Americans face a social pandemic of loneliness and isolation. The US surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, has declared it a crisis. His reports identify causes including the internet, smartphones and social media. None of these was created with this agenda, but all of them have advanced it. Some of the ‘examples of harm’ listed by Murthy include ‘technology that displaces in-person engagement, monopolises our attention, reduces the quality of our interactions and even diminishes our self-esteem’.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic worsened isolation, but tech had already made redundant many of the ways we used to congregate and mingle, while often portraying those ventures into the world as dangerous, unpleasant, inefficient and inconvenient. There is an underlying assumption that each of us aspires to be as productive as possible, and that stripping away everything seen to interfere with productivity is a good thing. This was the pitch made by many new companies in the 1990s, when online shopping and other digital financial transactions first became a big deal. The shift has reshaped cityscapes as well as psyches. The American Booksellers Association reported that in 2021 alone, ‘the movement of dollars to Amazon and away from retailers displaced 136,000 shops occupying 1.1 billion square feet of traditional commercial space.’ That’s a lot of local jobs and relationships both to places and people.</p><p>The small independent businesses that we’re losing sold goods, but they also gave away for free all sorts of things that are less tangible. There might be cheaper ways to buy shampoo or a better selection of envelopes online, but at an in-person store you can have a social interaction, even build a relationship with the proprietor and chat with other customers, or run into a friend or neighbour. That may happen in big chains such as Starbucks – but the employees aren’t likely to be around for long, the profit doesn’t go back into the community and the design of the place is generic, not reflecting its environment.</p><p>The San Francisco of my youth was full of small shops whose friendly eccentricity felt like part of the place. Some of them still exist but they’re rarer now. Many had old photographs of the business or the neighbourhood, some had artefacts of the past or pieces of the owner’s art. The little liquor and grocery store in my old neighbourhood had a wall of pictures of locals attending its annual barbecue and a ledger in which the proprietor recorded transactions with elderly locals who bought their groceries on credit and paid up at the end of the month. The exchanges between people who knew one another were non-commodities these small businesses offered along with whatever was for sale.</p><p>In her urbanist manifesto <em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em> (1961), Jane Jacobs wrote about ‘eyes on the street’: about the way that pedestrian traffic, people moving around – or sitting around – in public, kept a place safe and more than safe: convivial, gregarious. I think of what has come to my city as ‘the great withdrawal’. People on the street often seem to have their eyes elsewhere, usually on their phones: they might video a crime, but they might also not notice it’s happening. Many seem to flinch at direct contact with strangers or pretend the apparent intrusion didn’t happen, so I’ve come to avoid the tiny interactions that seem much more welcome in New Orleans, even in New York City.</p><p>After a childhood nearby, I moved to San Francisco in 1980 when street life and bar life were vibrant, but cafés were rare outside North Beach’s Italian neighbourhood. They proliferated in the 1980s and 1990s as places to hang out, maybe read, maybe chat to whomever was around or just people-watch. In this millennium, in cafés frequented by young white people, every customer seems to be silently staring at an Apple product, so that the places look and feel like offices. Even this phase may be on the way out. The next phase – of trying to keep customers from sticking around – has arrived. A food industry magazine published a story in April last year with the headline ‘In 2023, San Francisco Coffee Shops Want You to Get the Hell Out. The Vibe Is to Leave. Like Right Now,’ explaining that cafés were removing tables and chairs and focusing exclusively on take-away products, in part because cafés were being used as free office space. Cultural, social and religious institutions have been displaced or run aground, film festivals and art centres have left the city, historic businesses, including the oldest Black-owned bookstore in the US, have been evicted, all while wealth continues to concentrate at the fastest rate ever seen.</p><p>San Francisco has been a contradictory place since its rebirth in the late 1840s, when the US seized Mexico’s northern half, including California, and renamed the port town of Yerba Buena after the Italian saint. It has always been populated by dreamers, eccentrics and bohemians as well as opportunists and profiteers; until recently there was room for all of them. The Big Four railroad barons were Sacramento merchants who made small fortunes equipping goldminers, then relocated to San Francisco and made outrageous fortunes building the western half of the transcontinental railroad, fleecing the government and monopolising long-distance transportation in the west. With this wealth, Leland Stanford founded Stanford University in 1885 on the site of his horse ranch 35 miles south of the city, and it was from Stanford’s loins that Silicon Valley sprang.</p><p>In 1959, the Buddhist priest Shunryu Suzuki was dispatched to San Francisco’s Japantown to serve the local Japanese American community. Young white people who had read or heard about Zen came to be taught by him, and their enthusiasm so exceeded that of his original congregation that he set up the San Francisco Zen Centre, which has ever since been an incubator for Zen practitioners and priests, who’ve founded daughter temples and zendos all over the western world. Zen, like the poetry performances in San Francisco’s little co-op galleries and bars, was about being present, being together, being in the moment, about learning how, as the psychedelic guru Ram Dass put it, to ‘be here now.’</p><p>The same year that Suzuki arrived, Ronald Davis founded the San Francisco Mime Troupe, which still stages free outdoor performances of raucously political theatre. The Sierra Club was expanding from its roots as a California-based mountaineering club with some achievements in conservation into a national force for environmental protection. Down the peninsula, the first semiconductor firms were growing, but tech remained a small part of the region’s economy, at least for the next few decades. Not far from the primordial tech companies, the CIA was testing LSD on paid test subjects; it would wend its way out of hospital settings and into the counterculture that flourished here in the 1960s.</p><p>The Daughters of Bilitis launched in San Francisco in 1955 to defend lesbian rights and build a lesbian community; its founders, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, were the first couple to get married when City Hall opened to same-sex weddings in 2004; and while the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City are justly famous, drag queens in San Francisco had demonstrated against police oppression three years earlier in the Compton’s Cafeteria Riot, and a number of cabaret drag shows and lesbian and leather bars flourished in the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>Though much of the late 1990s dotcom boom – and crash – happened in San Francisco, until about a dozen years ago Silicon Valley was generally thought of as San Jose, the city anchoring the south end of the Bay Area, and the suburban sprawl up the San Francisco peninsula. The luxury shuttle buses that Facebook, Google and Apple launched for their employees around 2012, by easing the congested commute, encouraged large numbers of them to move to San Francisco, which has now been fully annexed by the Valley. The desire of tech workers to live in this dense, diverse place while their products create its opposite is an ongoing conundrum. Many tech workers think of themselves as edgy, as outsiders, as countercultural, even as they’re part of immense corporations that dominate culture, politics and the economy. The much-told story of Apple’s founding, in a garage near San Jose, doesn’t change the fact that, with a market cap of $3 trillion, it’s now the world’s most valuable company.</p><p>Though the city has survived a series of local and national recessions in recent decades, San Francisco is said to be in a ‘doom loop’ because so much office space and so many shops have been abandoned since the pandemic. Tech layoffs drove some of the shutdown, but the industry also enabled a mass white-collar withdrawal from the workplace – employees working from home, sometimes leaving the region to work remotely. More than the shrinkage of the population and the emptying out of downtown, the new mood of the city seems to be influenced by a kind of shrinking from human contact. The city remains the densely urban place it always was, but the way people inhabit it is increasingly suburban, looking to avoid strangers and surprises.</p><p>Over the past twenty years, ranks of glass towers have risen up just south of the city’s old downtown. The second tallest building west of the Mississippi River is San Francisco’s Salesforce Tower, whose resemblance, thanks to its curved sides and blunt edges, to a dildo or penis is often noted. It’s certainly a monument to hubris. It’s so tall that its isolated tip can be seen from many vantage points in the Bay Area – an Instagram account called @JustTheTipSF documents its intrusions. Completed in 2018, the tower has been half-empty since Salesforce, with the volatility typical of the tech industry, laid off many of its employees early last year (before hiring another few thousand in the autumn). Tech companies routinely push out other businesses only to flop or morph or migrate, leaving only emptiness in their wake. Salesforce – the city’s largest private employer – has also vacated Salesforce East, which stands next to yet another new high-rise, the mostly residential 58-storey Millennium Tower, which opened in 2009. The marketing brochure for Millennium Tower called it the first ‘ultra-luxury high-rise … a sophisticated oasis in the heart of SoMa’s tech capital’, though by 2015 its faulty construction had led to tilting and sinking. Following lawsuits from residents, $100 million was spent in an attempt to shore it up.</p><p>San Francisco is often described as a cauldron of crime and depravity, and held up as proof that progressive policies don’t work. I spent some time in New Mexico last summer and found that when people heard where I was from they were aghast: they wanted to know how I was surviving the mayhem. In recent years right-wing media have propagated stories about crime, homelessness and the city’s real (but hardly unique) fentanyl crisis. On a TV debate in November between former mayor Gavin Newsom (now governor of California) and Ron DeSantis (far-right governor of Florida and failed candidate for the Republican nomination), DeSantis brandished a (made-up) map of human excrement in San Francisco that was supposed to clinch his arguments. It’s a narrative that conservatives, including many tech barons, use to justify their demands for the kind of war on crime – more cops, harsher punishments, fewer civil liberties – that their predecessors pushed in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>Levels of violent crime are actually lower in San Francisco than in many American cities. Theft is a bigger problem, but like homelessness it has been exacerbated by the tech boom, which brought an influx of well-paid workers and a steep rise in housing prices over the past three decades, as well as by nationwide economic shifts and cuts in social services since the 1980s. Still, a video of an impoverished-looking Black guy in a San Francisco drugstore stuffing a trash bag full of goods and wheeling it away on his bicycle became an online sensation in 2021. The closures of several downtown chain stores were blamed by their parent corporations on theft, but when journalists looked into the stories, they found that in most cases outlets were closed because of low revenue and other more mundane problems.</p><p><span>N</span><span>evertheless,</span>​ the idea that San Francisco is in the grip of lawlessness has become something everyone thinks they know. When the well-known tech executive Bob Lee (Google, Square, MobileCoin) was found fatally stabbed on the street in the early hours of 4 April 2023, many claimed that his murder was part of a crime wave by an out-of-control underclass. Elon Musk tweeted that ‘violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately,’ implying that the culprit was a habitual criminal benefiting from lenient policies. The tech venture capitalist Matt Ocko raged: ‘Chesa Boudin [the former San Francisco district attorney] &amp; the criminal-loving city council that enabled him and a lawless SF for years have Bob’s literal blood on their hands.’</p><p>But it turned out that the man charged with Lee’s murder, Nima Momeni, was a fellow tech entrepreneur who had been with Lee that evening. Lee died with cocaine and ketamine in his system; local news reported that the victim, the alleged murderer and the murderer’s sister had all been doing drugs that day. At least some of the drugs seem to have c0me from Jeremy Boivin, a friend of Lee’s, also previously in tech, who was arrested in 2021 with a kilo of cocaine and a kilo of methamphetamine, and again in 2022 for possession of cocaine, heroin and meth. In 2020 he was charged with giving the date-rape drug GHB to his housekeeper and sexually assaulting her (according to <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Lee paid his bail). On the afternoon of 3 April, according to reports, Lee was at Boivin’s home with Momeni’s sister and another woman; both women ingested GHB and passed out.</p><p>The district attorney who prosecuted Boivin, Chesa Boudin, noted that there is a belief ‘among conservatives in this city that it’s only scary poor people who are doing drugs. The reality is that the tech industry is deep in … drugs.’ The city’s main online news site, Mission Local, quoted a friend of Momeni’s who said that he had a cocaine problem of ‘the regular Bay Area executive sort’ and that his phone number ‘appears on a website commonly used by sex workers to warn one another of dangerous or problematic clients’. Momeni’s attorneys suggested the murderer might be a homeless man who was found sleeping near where Lee died, even though Momeni’s DNA was found on the handle of the murder weapon, a kitchen knife that matches a set in his sister’s kitchen. A security camera captured Lee and Momeni leaving the Millennium Tower, where Momeni’s sister lived with her plastic surgeon husband. They got into Momeni’s white BMW; another security camera caught them getting out of the car a few blocks away. For a moment they are hidden; then Momeni can be seen getting back into the car and driving away. Lee, staggering into view of yet another security camera, managed to call 911 to report that he’d been stabbed. He was found bleeding and unconscious on the sidewalk, and pronounced dead at the hospital.</p><p>Lee collapsed in front of a luxury apartment building at 403 Main Street. The address seemed familiar so I looked it up: it’s a block from the 301 Main Street Infinity Tower, in whose $7 million penthouse the tech mogul Gurbaksh Chahal was, a decade earlier, recorded on his own bedroom surveillance camera clobbering a woman 117 times and repeatedly threatening to kill her. He was dumped as CEO of his ad-tech firm and eventually did prison time for violating his probation with another round of violence against another woman. Chahal currently heads a startup whose actual functions are wreathed in the flowery vagueness – ‘cutting-edge AI seamlessly merges with global commerce … shifting from basic transactions to insightful exchanges’ – endemic to industry prose.</p><p>Crime in the San Francisco Bay Area can be described in many ways. But there are no dramatic videos showing Palo Alto native son turned crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried misappropriating $8.6 billion of clients’ money or of the scam run by ex-Stanford student Elizabeth Holmes, who raised $700 million for Theranos, a company whose sole product was a medical technology that didn’t exist. Holmes, who used to live in a $15 million mansion and fly in a private Theranos jet, is doing time in federal prison for defrauding investors. Bankman-Fried awaits sentencing. Those thefts were crimes in the most traditional sense, but the sheer wealth generated by Silicon Valley has given its pack of billionaires the belief that they are above or beyond the law. Most of them made their fortunes in finance or technology; those fortunes and the accompanying hubris and seclusion convinced them they were magnificent at everything and anything, including remaking society according to their lights.</p><p>In 2022 the billionaires William Oberndorf and David Sacks, former COO of PayPal, pumped money into a successful recall campaign against Boudin, shortly after his election as district attorney. A total of $7 million was donated to the effort, 80 per cent of it in amounts of $50,000 or more, $600,000 from Oberndorf alone; he has also spent extravagantly to back charter schools and fight the teachers’ union. Sacks, a friend of Musk’s, is a major backer of right-wing candidates for national office and seemingly obsessed with urban crime.</p><p>Another tech/venture capital billionaire and opponent of Boudin, Ron Conway, has long used his wealth to push San Francisco to the right. In 2010 he was a driving force behind an ordinance banning sitting on the sidewalk intended to criminalise those with nowhere else to go. In 2016, Conway and Oberndorf funded a ballot proposition to outlaw tent encampments, the homes of last resort for the unhoused. The tech elite tends to regard the homeless not as people with unmet needs, but as an intrusion or even assault on the sensibilities of others (though Mark Benioff, the founder of Salesforce, has made more benign donations, including $30 million to study the problem). If you equate your wealth with virtue, you tend to equate poverty with vice, and the enemies of the homeless routinely portray them as criminals. The assumption that Bob Lee was murdered by the underclass rather than one of his own speaks to this, as well as to the sense among tech leaders that they are the good guys, the people with solutions, sometimes the victims but never the perpetrators of problems.</p><p>In my own 44 years here, travelling on foot far more than most, I have never been menaced by a homeless person. Though a highly visible minority are mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse, many unhoused people are employed, are parents, are seniors, are students (including 2370 of the children enrolled in San Francisco public schools in 2022) or otherwise quotidian citizens. Illness and addiction are often the consequences, rather than the causes, of the devastating precarity, shame and stress of being unhoused. Market-rate housing is out of reach for a great many people, working or not, which has made finding employees for lower-wage jobs in retail, restaurants and vital services difficult for local employers. Here, too, San Francisco has an extreme version of a problem widespread in wealthy urban areas.</p><p>Perhaps the existence of the unhoused, stranded in an outside with no inside to retreat to, along with tech’s offerings and ideology, has encouraged people to stay indoors, or to venture into public spaces only with reluctance or trepidation. The proliferation of delivery services has made eating restaurant food at home common. ‘The exploitation economy is just as unhealthy and dehumanising for the customers as it is for the workers,’ Andrew Callaway, a San Francisco gig-worker, wrote in 2016. ‘You never even have to see the person who is cleaning your house or your clothes. Plenty of people requested that I drop off their food at the door. Customers grow to love apps that make the worker anonymous.’ In this system, the invisible hand of the market can actually bring you a burrito.</p><p><span>B</span><span>y producing</span>​ such extremes of wealth, tech is returning us to a kind of feudalism, with a few powerful figures accountable to no one. Here’s Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, who – after buying Twitter for an inflated $44 billion – invited in misinformation, disinformation and hate, providing a platform for extreme right-wingers, racists and conspiracy theorists, while also using his Starlink satellite technology first for and then against the Ukrainian military in their conflict with Russia. ‘There is little precedent for a civilian’s becoming the arbiter of a war between nations,’ Ronan Farrow wrote in the <em>New Yorker</em>, ‘or for the degree of dependency that the US now has on Musk in a variety of fields, from the future of energy and transportation to the exploration of space.’ Farrow also reported that people who know Musk say his ketamine use ‘has escalated in recent years, and that the drug, along with his isolation and his increasingly embattled relationship with the press, might contribute to his tendency to make chaotic and impulsive statements and decisions’.</p><p>Here’s Mark Zuckerberg, the fifth richest, who has turned a blind eye to Facebook’s role in election corruption around the world and in the genocide in Myanmar, and to Instagram’s role in the teenage mental health crisis. His company recently lost $46 billion on the Metaverse, the virtual-reality venture he has earnestly promoted. ‘Pretty soon,’ he said last September, ‘we’re going to be at a point where you’re going to be there physically with some of your friends, and others will be there digitally as avatars or holograms, and they’ll feel just as present as everyone else.’ Like technocrats before him, Zuckerberg insists that online connection is a perfect substitute for human contact.</p><p>Here’s Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal, who put $10 million into the lawsuit that in 2016 bankrupted Gawker, which had outed him as gay. This might make you think he cared about privacy, but he also founded Palantir, which surveils immigrants for the Department of Homeland Security, assisted in Cambridge Analytica’s weaponisation of Facebook user data on Trump’s behalf and, according to the Intercept, ‘has helped expand and accelerate the NSA’s global spy network, which is jointly administered with allied foreign agencies around the world’. Big tech is ferociously protective of its own privacy while abusing ours. Frank Wilhoit’s claim that ‘conservatism consists of one proposition: there must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect’ applies precisely to the industry and its captains.</p><p>While Musk dreams of space travel and colonies on other planets, Thiel dreams of immortality. Many tech billionaires do not believe they should be bound by the laws of nations or biology, and apparently want to continue consuming an outsize amount of the world’s resources indefinitely. ‘I stand against confiscatory taxes, totalitarian collectives and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual,’ Thiel wrote in an online libertarian journal in 2009. ‘I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.’ He didn’t choose democracy.</p><p>For a while, Thiel backed the libertarian wet dream known as seasteading, building artificial islands beyond government control. Thiel’s attempt to build a post-apocalyptic bunker in a remote part of New Zealand’s South Island was rejected, but Bill Gates, now only the world’s eighth richest person, has his own island in Belize. Oracle’s Larry Ellison, the world’s fourth richest person, owns 98 per cent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, resort hotels and all, which he’s made an inhospitable place for anyone who’s not enormously wealthy. According to <em>Wired</em>, Zuckerberg’s private compound covering 1400 acres of the Hawaiian island of Kauai includes multiple mansions and luxury treehouses, plus an underground bunker. (Tech billionaires often seem more interested in surviving the apocalypse than preventing it.) Non-disclosure agreements bind the construction workers who built it, and a long wall shuts off outsiders from any view of the sea while making access to the public beach extremely difficult.</p><p>You can’t really be in favour of both democracy and billionaires, because democracy requires equal opportunity in order to participate, and extreme wealth gives its holders unfathomable advantages with little accountability. I’ve long believed that democracy depends in part on co-existing with strangers and people unlike you, on feeling that you have something in common with them. The internet has helped people withdraw from diverse communities and shared experiences to huddle in like-minded groups, including groups focused on hating those they see as unlike them, while encouraging the disinhibition of anonymity.</p><p>Sometimes disconnection is itself the business model, as with the San Francisco-based Airbnb, which has undermined neighbourhoods around the world, from major cities to rural communities, by turning long-term housing, where people had roots and relationships, into short-term rentals, often jacking up the price of housing at the same time. A friend of mine who lives in Joshua Tree, the semi-rural community in the desert east of Los Angeles, has found herself surrounded entirely by short-term rentals, so she no longer has neighbours in the usual sense of the word.</p><p>The choices tech titans make in their personal lives – gated communities, private schools, private jets, mega-yachts, private islands – show that a segregated, shrouded life is their ideal. But they profit off technologies which, while encouraging our own social withdrawal, are focused on capturing as much information about us as possible. That is, we are both more isolated and less private than we’ve ever been. I have never to my knowledge seen any of these billionaires, but by necessity I use their platforms and software and move among their employees. I live in a city and to some extent in a world that has been radically reshaped by their urges and ideals, which are not my urges and ideals.</p><p>When I use cash to buy something in a shop, I sometimes joke to the cashier that this stuff is more secretive than crypto. If you’re paying Bay Area bridge tolls, using parking meters (which often require you to punch in your licence plate and use a credit card), getting coffee or anything else with a credit or debit card, you’re creating a record of your activities.

China has demonstrated that the new technologies can create a surveillance state far beyond anything previously imagined.

Some have grown rich on it; others have lost their life savings. Scams and lawsuits abound.</p><p>In an essay for the <em>New Republic</em> in 2022 about Sacks and his isolationist, new-right peers, Jacob Silverman wrote:</p><blockquote><p>The symbolic epicentre of this movement is San Francisco, but really it’s the entire curdled utopian dream of California. In the eyes of rich techies who have seen their beloved metropolis fall into decay, vast inequality and social misery, the state is dead. Their disappointment and alienation has melded with traditional Republican disgust toward liberal cities (and their non-white residents) to paint a picture of irredeemable urban squalor. These frightened urbanites are echoing the Trumpist drumbeat that cities – particularly in California – are dangerous, dark places that must be tamed.</p></blockquote><p>But they never really loved San Francisco, at least not as a place of diversity and free circulation, and they’ve never acknowledged their role in its dramatic economic divides, housing crises and desperate homeless population.</p><p><span>A</span><span>group</span>​ of these disgruntled tycoons has, however, decided to build a new city on the north-eastern outskirts of the Bay Area. Flannery Associates – a billionaires’ consortium whose members include Laurene Powell Jobs (Steve Jobs’s widow), Reid Hoffman (co-founder of LinkedIn) and the venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Michael Moritz – quietly bought up 50,000 acres of farmland in Solano County at a cost of around $800 million. (By way of comparison, San Francisco covers about 30,000 acres.) The area’s representative in Congress, John Garamendi, told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that ‘Flannery Associates is using secrecy, bullying and mobster tactics to force generational farm families to sell.’ Last August the group revealed its hand, sending out a survey announcing its intention to build ‘a new city with tens of thousands of new homes, a large solar energy farm, orchards with over a million new trees, and over ten thousand acres of new parks and open space’. Its website doesn’t give real answers to questions about the environmental impact of such a massive development, about the governance of a new city founded and (presumably) owned by an elite, about the public services needed for this private enterprise. Instead, Flannery Associates has released sedate pastel-toned pictures of blank-faced children playing on tree-lined streets of quaint row houses and blank-faced adults with brown and black as well as white skin riding bikes and sitting in a plaza.</p><p>It seems unlikely that any of the associates want to live in those row houses themselves or send their children out to play on the street or sit on the train with the Black lady in the picture. In 2022, Andreessen and his wife inveighed against building multi-family housing in their swanky Peninsula hometown of Atherton – average annual income $539,000, median home price $7.9 million – with an email to city government that read: ‘Please <span>IMMEDIATELY REMOVE</span> all multi-family overlay zoning projects from the Housing Element which will be submitted to the state in July. They will <span>MASSIVELY</span> decrease our home values, the quality of life of ourselves and our neighbours and <span>IMMENSELY</span> increase the noise pollution and traffic.’ People who live in apartments, never mind tents, were scum they didn’t want around, housing crisis be damned.</p><p>In a way, rich people don’t live anywhere: they are nomads who circulate between multiple dwellings. Andreessen owns a $177 million compound in Malibu, and Jobs has three mansions there, along with palatial homes in San Francisco and Palo Alto, a rural retreat in Los Altos Hills near San Jose, an equestrian estate in Florida, a 15,000-square-foot home in Woodside (the rural district of choice for Silicon Valley’s richest) and part of Kona Village, a Hawaiian resort.</p><p>Local opposition to the Flannery Associates project has been ferocious, and the county government responded by declaring that it wouldn’t rezone farmland for urban development. I don’t know whether these billionaires know what a city is, but I do know that they have laid their hands on the city that’s been my home since 1980 and used their wealth to undermine its diversity and affordability, demonise its poor, turn its politicians into puppets and push its politics to the right. They have produced many kinds of dystopia without ever deviating from the line that they are bringing us all to a glorious utopia for which they deserve our admiration.</p><p>I used to be proud of being from the San Francisco Bay Area. I thought of this place in terms of liberation and protection; we were where the environmental movement was born; we were the land of experimental poetry and anti-war marches, of Harvey Milk and gay rights, of the occupation of Alcatraz Island that galvanised a nationwide Indigenous rights movement as well as Cesar Chavez’s farmworkers’ movement in San Jose and the Black Panthers in Oakland. We were the left edge of America, a refuge from some of its brutalities and conformities, a sanctuary for dissidents and misfits and a laboratory for new ideas. We’re still that lab, but we’re no longer an edge; we’re a global power centre, and what issues from here – including a new super-elite – shapes the world in increasingly disturbing ways.</p></div></div>

<p>Shahid Kamal Ahmad wrote: “The first Apple Silicon Macs were such a profound leap forward in power and battery life that it’s hard to see how Apple could have done much better with the M2 and then the M3. The differences have been minor, and as usual, they’ve not been completely transparent about the purported benefits of the upgraded chips. That said, there’s still nothing close to any Mac with Apple Silicon and they’ve preserved their lead over the competition.”</p>
<p>John Gruber wrote: “By the end of the year, every single Mac in the lineup, save one, is arguably in the best shape that model has <em>ever</em> been.</p>
<p>“The 24-inch iMac skipped the M2 generation but got an update to the M3, along with Apple making it as clear as possible that they have no plans to make a 27-inch iMac with Apple silicon. I’m OK with that — I think a Studio Display with a Mac Mini is better solution. And those who miss the iMac Pro of the Intel era are better off with a Studio Display and Mac Studio.</p>
<p>“The Mac Pro is the only sour note in the lineup. It finally came to Apple silicon (hooray), but spec-wise it’s pretty much a Mac Studio with advanced I/O options (boo). If your work requires high-end I/O, that’s great. But if not, it’s hard to see anything the Mac Pro offers that the Mac Studio doesn’t, other than a higher price and consuming a <em>lot</em> more space on or under your desk. Even if this first Apple silicon Mac Pro is a disappointment though, I say it’s great news overall, because it’s a sign that Apple still wants the Mac Pro in its lineup. At some point in the next year or two, I expect Apple to unveil a Mac Pro with specs that race ahead of the Mac Studio. It’s just obviously the case that Apple silicon isn’t there yet.”</p>
<p>Rob Griffiths wrote: “Apple Silicon continues to impress, and Apple seems to be making models people want… except, where is the 27-inch iMac? I don’t want to go down in screen real estate.”</p>
<p>Adam Engst wrote: “Although there is always room for quibbles, such as with the loss of the 27-inch iMac and the awkwardness of releasing the M2 Pro/Max MacBook Pros just nine months before the M3 Pro/Max models, Apple is hitting the Mac out of Apple Park. If anything, Apple’s next task is going to be to figure out what new general capabilities (perhaps AI-driven?) the Mac can be given that would give most people reason to look beyond the low-end chips. That said, the Studio Display remains a disappointment, particularly with respect to the camera, which was supposed to set a new standard rather than still paling in comparison to an iPhone in Continuity Camera mode.”</p>
<p>Christina Warren wrote: “What a year for the Mac! I had to look back at the excellent MacTracker to remind myself of all the new Macs we got in 2023. Not only did we get updates for every Mac across the lineup (with the exception of the 13” MacBook Air), the Apple silicon transition is now officially ‘complete.’ I do feel a little bad for anyone who dropped $4500 on an M2 Max MacBook Pro, only to see the M3 Max 10 months later. The quality of the Apple silicon chips are getting seriously refined and very good.</p>
<p>“I upgraded to a 14-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro this year (from a 14-inch M1 Max model) and if I’m honest, it was an upgrade I absolutely didn’t need to make. The performance gains over two years are real, but Apple knocked it out of the park so much, so early, that most people can buy a machine for years and literally not think about it. That’s definitely the biggest change from the late-stage Intel era. The 15-inch MacBook Air is probably the best laptop for most regular users, and I’m glad it exists. For the first time in years, most of the Mac lineup is finally cohesive and reasonably differentiated.</p>
<p>“I do, however, have complaints. First, shipping any laptop (or desktop for that matter), with 8GB of RAM today is criminal. It’s even worse when said 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro costs $1600. That’s unacceptable. The fact that Apple hasn’t changed the base RAM in a MacBook Pro since mid-2012 is out of step with reality, and as good as the Apple silicon chips are, I worry about encouraging even regular users to buy laptops with antiquated amounts of memory when the starting prices are so high.</p>
<p>“The Mac Pro, in my opinion, is the only clear miss in the lineup right now. It does not need to exist. It is a completely unnecessary product that will appeal to exactly seven people (all of whom probably work at Apple) and if Apple can’t do better, it should just retire the Mac Pro moniker once and for all. At least the Mac Studio with M2 Ultra exists. The iMac still exists, I guess, but Apple has clearly fallen out of love with my very favorite computer. Such is life. All in all, a great year for the Mac.”</p>
<p>Myke Hurley wrote: “Very solid continuation of the Mac lineup. Good hardware revisions and additions – putting the focus in the products that matter most to the lineup, clearing some things up and better positioning themselves for the future of Apple Silicon.”</p>
<p>Leo Laporte wrote: “Apple Silicon continues to lead the pack and Apple’s forethought on building in ML co-processing into ALL its devices puts them way ahead in the race for on-device AI. Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Intel are just now getting to the starting line. Abandoning the Touch Bar and Butterfly keyboard, and adding ports to the MacBook Pros, shows they’re finally listening to their users instead of arrogantly plowing ahead with poor designs.”</p>
<p>David Sparks wrote: “With Apple Silicon, Apple has brought powerful, power-efficient computing to everyone. You can do almost anything now with a MacBook Air. It’s amazing. Then there is the Mac Pro. The Apple Silicon transition was like an Olympic gymnast doing a perfect vault… and then stumbling on the landing. I expect that things didn’t go as Apple planned for the Mac Pro last year, and those things happen. Since they are still making one, they probably have a plan to sort it out. I just wish they’d share a little bit of it.”</p>
<p>Stephen Hackett wrote: “2023 marked the end of the transition to Apple silicon. It may have taken longer than Apple anticipated, but it’s hard to argue with the results. Macs are running faster, cooler and longer than they ever could with Intel inside. All it cost was the Mac Pro’s dignity, which it just regained in 2019. The last Intel model was everything a Mac Pro should be—expandable, upgradeable and more powerful than anything else in the line. The new one is a Mac Studio with slots and optional wheels. That’s disappointing for users who were hoping to throw more GPU power at their problems.</p>
<p>“On the software front, Sonoma is proving to be a stable release, which is nice after a few years of bumpy builds. It’s hallmark feature is probably the addition Desktop Widgets. They aren’t for me though; call me when <a href="https://512pixels.net/2022/01/apple-should-bring-back-dashboard/">Dashboard</a> is brought back to life. However, problems remain. Just try to walk someone though making a change in System Settings over a FaceTime call and you’ll want to hurl your iPhone into the nearest body of water. And look no farther than <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/11/a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-permissions-requests/">this blog post by Jason</a> to relive the horror of setting up a new Mac. Apple has a lot of work to do in these areas, and I’m hopeful progress is being made on them for macOS 15 this year.”</p>
<p>Matt Deatherage wrote: “It’s difficult to ding Apple’s Mac performance. With Apple Silicon leading the way, the Mac hardware seems to be hitting all the sweet spots, and even the iMac finally got an M3 upgrade after 2 1/2 years. But they might as well have named the Mac Pro the ‘Mac Elite,’ priced way out of range for most professionals in most jobs. macOS security features that were individually good ideas have become a tangle of dozens of dialog boxes that simultaneously demand immediate attention and won’t respond because other dialogs are popping up.</p>
<p>“Apple pours its Mac resources into technologies we now know are critical to Apple Vision (VRKit, ARKit, Metal). Meanwhile, critical systems like Mail lose old plug-in functionality in favor of extensions that lack key features (and don’t implement their documented features thanks to bugs that go unfixed for years). Even using newer replacements for older kernel extensions (like Rogue Amoeba) still requires kernel access, a security setting that requires two reboots and disables Apple Pay. It’d be nice if 2024 Macs weren’t missing productivity features from 2008 Macs.”</p>
<p>John Siracusa wrote: “The new Mac Pro ended the Apple Silicon transition this year, not with a bang but a whimper. The promise of owning and controlling this particular ‘primary technology’ is that it allows Apple to make exactly the processors it needs for its specific products. The downside is that Apple now has to make the processors for <em>all</em> its products, including the exotic, high-end ones that sell in very low volumes. When it came time to open its wallet and pay for the monster SoC that the Mac Pro deserves—and that <em>only</em> the Mac Pro will ever use—Apple decided it could not stomach the ROI. So we got a Mac Pro with the same SoC as the tiny Mac Studio, and no support for discrete GPUs. Pretty much every other Mac continues to be amazing these days, so the Mac Pro didn’t drag the year down too much. And, hey, at least it still exists, leaving the door open for an Apology Mac Pro™ some time in the future.</p>
<p>“Apple’s pricing for Mac storage and RAM upgrades has been absurd for decades, but the lack of most other forms of configurability in recent years has really highlighted this problem. Apple seems to be carrying all of its (considerable) Mac profit margins on the backs of these two options, leading to upgrade prices that are often <em>four times</em> higher than market prices for the same amounts of storage and memory. This seems unsustainable to me, but maybe Apple’s sales figures tell it otherwise. Either way, it doesn’t feel great.”</p>
<p>Brett Terpstra wrote: “The Mac Studio is the greatest Mac I’ve ever owned. Up until this point the M1 Air had my heart, but this thing is a powerhouse and it’s only getting better. Someday we’ll see the kind of modular capabilities of the Mac Pro in a more affordable model, but for now, one of these things maxed out is an amazing computing platform.”</p>
<p>Gabe Weatherhead wrote: “There has never been a better Mac than almost any Mac you can get now. Their lineup is solid and makes sense. They’ve done a good job differentiating the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air lines for portables and the Mac mini versus the Mac studio for desktops. Apple silicon is a beast. I think the biggest risk Apple has is that you just don’t really need to upgrade these machines very often.”</p>
<p>Benjamin Mayo wrote: “I think both the 15-inch MacBook Air and the base M3 MacBook Pro are very significant steps forward for the Mac. Their introductions meant that Apple finally divorced itself from pairing display specs with the processors those laptops run on. It was a great improvement for the lineup. The Mac Pro was a disappointment, although it doesn’t matter so much because the machine was of niche appeal anyway. But I hope that Apple can one day flex with a true trophy top-of-the-line Apple Silicon Mac.”</p>
<p>James Thomson wrote: “Apple Silicon continued to outpace everything else on the market – the M3 Max MBPs are significantly faster than even my M1 Ultra Mac Studio. The Mac Pro finally appeared, with more of an apologetic shrug for being late than any real fanfare. Sonoma seemed to deliver the relative lack of new features of a Snow Leopard style release, without the focus on stability and bug fixes. It feels almost as if everybody was working away on some other new product. Generally, the Mac trundled solidly along to its 40th birthday.”</p>
<p>Kirk McElhearn wrote: “I think that we’ve entered a new era for the Mac, with the M-series processors. I’m still rocking my M1 iMac, which I have sworn to keep for five years, along with an M2 MacBook Air, which may be my favorite Mac ever. With the speed and battery life of these new Macs, and the sustained though incremental improvements of the chips, Apple is on a roll.”</p>
<p>Carolina Milanesi wrote: “The Mac has become the focus of every PC OEM, while historically ignored or seen as just an annoyance (beyond the education segment). It’s clear that it now represents a threat especially in the higher segment of the market.”</p>
<p>Glenn Fleishman wrote: “This year seemed like a building year on the Mac platform instead of a revolution. The success of Apple silicon is such that even releasing new generations of chips that, with each one, are the most powerful in their class ever, just seems expected. Nevertheless, Apple built on strengths, rolled out a series of updates—particularly welcome with the iMac, which was overdue for a chip bump—and kept entry-level prices feeling quite reasonable. I felt there was a sense of stagnation on the Mac side in how these models were received, though—this might stem from the fact that people bought so many M-series Macs during the pandemic, particularly when the tech sector was flush with cash and hiring like mad, that seeing a modest performance update may feel blah. The Mac hardware grid seems pretty well populated, and I wonder if Apple will ever find a way to break out of the expectations they set. The iMac could surely use more variations, but is there room in a packed line-up?</p>
<p>“Sonoma is probably one of my favorite macOS updates in years. While System Settings is still awkward, the continued alignment of iOS/iPadOS and macOS makes working between platforms easier. I am not sure there is a marquee feature improvement—Apple’s Sonoma website promotes Screen Savers at the top of the list of what’s new! But I think the host of improvements make macOS more pleasant to use than Ventura. The improvements for video and videoconferencing are quite stunning, particularly when you factor in full Continuity Camera for iPhone integration. The video menu now centralizes a lot of scattered features and it takes some getting used to. But I feel like Apple finally got its feet under itself for centering video controls.”</p>
<p>Chance Miller wrote: “The Mac continues to move forward at an impressive rate, even three years into the Apple Silicon era. The 15-inch MacBook Air is an excellent addition to the lineup that I think more people are buying than some of us think. The Mac Pro sits in an awkward spot, but at least it has Apple Silicon inside now. I’m still hoping that Apple can make that long-rumored ‘Extreme’ Apple Silicon chip at some point. Right now, it’s pretty hard to justify choosing a Mac Pro over a Mac Studio. At long last, 2023 was also the year the Touch Bar died. The new entry-level MacBook Pro is a far more compelling machine than its predecessor, even if it is a bit more expensive. That gorgeous ProMotion display is more than enough to justify the price increase in my book.”</p>
<p>Nick Heer wrote: “Apple started the year with MacBook Pro updates and, somehow, ended the year with more MacBook Pro updates. macOS is increasingly showing the strain of looking and feeling more like iOS while retaining the things which make it a Mac.”</p>
<p>Federico Viticci wrote: “Apple’s Mac lineup is solid, if only a tad boring. Apple Silicon Macs are great and I love my M2 MacBook Air (arguably, the best laptop Apple’s ever made), but now that we’ve had M-series Macs for over three years, the novelty of Apple Silicon has somewhat worn off. While in Windows land companies are making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025592/asus-rog-zephyrus-14-16-strix-scar-laptops-ces-price-specs-impressions">OLED laptops</a>, laptops with touch, laptops with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031220/asus-zenbook-duo-dual-oled-screen-laptop-vivobook-pro-tuf-gaming">two screens</a>, and other weird and fun things, Apple’s still making basic, regular laptops without touch input. I understand Apple not wanting to go full-weird like ASUS or Lenovo often do, but making a computer without touch input in 2023 feels… just wrong to me at this point.</p>
<p>“At the same time, I found Apple’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-m3s-potential-to-transform-mac-gaming/">newfound commitment to gaming</a> on the Mac fascinating and an area worth keeping an eye on in the future. Are a handful of AAA games coming to the Mac a sign of much bigger ambitions? Can Apple’s work on GPUs compete in the long term with Nvidia and AMD? Is there a future in which Apple may bring back eGPU support for Macs, perhaps thanks to the higher bandwidth afforded by Thunderbolt 5? I hope to get answers to some of these questions in 2024.”</p>
<p>Quinn Nelson wrote: “While the narrative this year has focused on the M3 Pro and its ‘lack’ of performance upgrades, the base M3 and M3 Max received the biggest leap in performance since the M1. The product mix underwhelmed slightly, but the SoC itself exceeded all expectations.”</p>
<p>John Moltz wrote: “Apple’s MacBook Pro updates have come fairly frequently in recent years but this is the first time it’s worked out so we’ve had two updates in a calendar year. I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the M3 MacBook Pros are [looks around then whispers] the fastest MacBooks evaaaah. True story. Also, we finally (FINALLY) got an update to the iMac line, with zippy new M3 processors. Not the best Mac year for sure, but a solid outing.”</p>
<p>Andy Ihnatko wrote: “I keep seeing fresh ideas in Windows laptops and wish Apple would apply some of that ambition to Macs. But I appreciate that Apple can’t afford to be experimental.”</p>
<p>Alex Lindsay wrote: “While I know Apple has its reasons, I still feel that rolling out high-end chips to the lower end models creates confusion at the top. I believe Apple will eventually move to releasing the fastest chips to the performance machines first.”</p>
<p>Devindra Hardawar wrote: “The M3 chips were a nice update, and it’s nice to see the 14-inch Macbook Pro drop in price. I’m also very glad to see the useless 13-inch MacBook Pro die, finally.”</p>
<p>Michael Gartenberg wrote: “The M3 itself is awesome but many users are still quite happy with their M1, myself included. macOS was kinda ho-hum, but fit the widgets everywhere theme.”</p>
<p>Brent Simmons wrote: “Macs are so good these days! It’s a dream come true.”</p>
<p>Jessica Dennis wrote: “Although I will remain forever annoyed that the new (black! for real this time!) MacBook Pro series was announced literally the day after my new work MBP had shipped, it was nevertheless a very good year for the Mac. The Midnight MacBook Air that I bought for personal use is also a great machine — it was my first Apple Silicon Mac, and the battery life really is as amazing as promised.”</p>
<p>Dan Seifert wrote: “The Mac hasn’t missed since the Apple Silicon transition and 2023 was no different. It had some weirdness — two generations of MacBook Pro models released in the same calendar year can be confusing to consumers, albeit not terrible — but the Mac is still in a better place than it’s been in decades. Although the 15-inch MacBook Air didn’t seem to ignite a fire in consumers, it’s still a great computer that was long overdue in Apple’s lineup and I’m glad the option for those wanting a MacBook with a bigger screen, but not wanting to pay $2500 to get it, is there. Points off for Apple’s continued insistence in starting with a measly 8GB of RAM in its computers and then its absurd pricing for RAM and storage upgrades. It’s beyond time for that to be adjusted to be closer in line with market component rates.”</p>
<p>Charles Arthur wrote: “On the Mac, Apple is chugging along. M2 to M3 transition handled well, Back to (Space) Black for the MacBook Pro, at last the big-screened MacBook Air (not that anyone seems to be buying it). Even a Mac Pro, not that anyone buys them either.”</p>
<p>Brian Mattucci wrote: “I wish Apple would release the Mac Studio alongside the Pro/Max chips and simply offer an Ultra option five months later when that chip is available. There’s not enough time between Mac Studio availability and the next Mac Studio-relevant M-series chip being released. I do not want to buy a Mac Studio with M3 Max when 3 months later the M4 Max will be a thing.”</p>
<p>Peter Cohen wrote: “Much has been made about Apple’s push for gaming legitimacy with the M3-based Macs. To be frank, it’s hard to be optimistic about their efforts – there are so many factors that keep the Mac marginalized as a game platform which Apple has no control over, like the dominance of Windows APIs and programming knowledge with game developers, Nvidia’s GPUs, and a general gaming malaise from Mac users. Regardless, the Mac’s Apple Silicon transition is paying huge dividends we didn’t see during the Intel Mac era.”</p>
<p>Dan Moren wrote: “The Mac continues to absolutely kill it. M2 Pro/Max and the M3 generation in a single year? My only concern is whether Apple can continue to sustain this pace of development.”</p>
<p>Shelly Brisbin wrote: “It was great to see the M3 chips make their debut in MacBook Pros, but I would like to have seen them spread to more of the product line as well. The move to Sonoma seemed to go smoothly, and a few new features on the software side, like enhanced screen sharing and Safari profiles actually make my life better.”</p>
<p>Ben Long wrote: “I was at the Apple Store on Union Square earlier this year and was shocked at how much it feels like walking into a T-mobile store. The store is geared sop heavily toward phones and iPads – the Macs were on a single table. For an aging computer nerd, it’s hard not to feel blah about the state of personal computing because the PC is no longer the foundation of personal computing. I can’t blame Apple for following where the market goes, and I think they’re doing a fine job of servicing what the desktop computer market is right now, but for me the exciting computer stuff is not happening at Apple. They are an appliance store.”</p>
<p>Michael Tsai wrote: “Mac hardware is in a great place except for the lack of options for displays larger than the iMac. SSD pricing is looking even more unreasonable. It’s a shame that the Magic peripherals still use Lightning. The software side is still a mess, both in terms of reliability and design. I like Safari profiles.”</p>
<p>Eric Slivka wrote: “The new 15″ size for the MacBook Air is a great option for non-power users, but it’s a shame it arrived so long after its smaller sibling that it gave significant pause about whether to wait for the next generation. Can’t complain about two MacBook Pro updates in the same year including the simultaneous debuts of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. The iMac update was underwhelming considering how old the M1 model was, and it didn’t bring a highly desired larger model.”</p>
<p>Casey Liss wrote: “The Mac continues to fire on all cylinders. I almost complained about Apple not updating the Mac mini… but sure enough, it was updated last January. So many Macs shipped in 2023 that last January seems far, far away. What a lovely change of pace. Even the Mac Pro got refreshed, finally entering the Apple Silicon era. Granted, the purpose of the Mac Pro is questionable at best, but still, it got attention. Apple Silicon continues to be a revelation. It is not all things to <em>all</em> people, but damned if it isn’t close. Incredible performance, incredible battery life, little heat. With Intel, you could choose one, or maybe two, of those pillars. With Apple Silicon, all three are available. After years of being ignored, it just feels so damn good to matter again.”</p>
<p>Matt Birchler wrote: “It’s hard to say much bad about the Mac right now. If someone walks into an Apple Store today, they’re going to walk out with a very good computer no matter what they get, and something that is miles better than the Intel Mac they’re probably upgrading from. The Mac Pro is the only model that gets a real raised eyebrow from me, as it seems to have less of a reason to exist now (especially at its price point) than it ever has before. I also can’t help but wonder what the next step for the Mac is. Apple has basically perfected the current designs, but what’s the next exciting hardware and interaction innovation on the Mac? iPads and Macs have basically the same internal guts these days, and I can’t help but think about what a portable Mac running on iPad-like hardware could look like one day.”</p>

The improvements that Apple has been focusing on in camera and raw chip performance do not make a significant difference to me, and I think we’re long overdue for Apple to take some risks and actually push the industry forward with the iPhone.

The latter has allowed me to take my usage of Shortcuts to the next level by having a system-wide activation method that no longer requires me to run shortcuts from widgets or the share sheet.

<p>“The adoption of USB-C is just icing on the cake for these new iPhones. Regardless of whether or not Apple was going to switch to USB-C anyway without the EU forcing their hand, the net benefit for me has been the fact that the iPhone is now part of my existing ecosystem of USB-C accessories that all use the same connector.

On the positive side, iPadOS 17 doesn’t feel much different than 16, but Apple did address a lot of the problems that Stage Manager had at launch. It’s still not as flexible or easy to use as I’d like, but I can use it way more effectively now when I have to. I think we’d all like Apple to really give the aging iPad Pro a proper redesign, which by all accounts is likely coming this year. And then Apple needs to simplify the lineup: cut the price of the 10th Gen model below $400, jettison the 9th Gen, and put some distance between the iPad Air and the iPad Pro, which are far too similar for most people.”</p>

I’ve got a watch that’s 40 years old that I can take down the street and get the battery replaced for 15 bucks…”</p>

The double-tap gesture sounded good, but like the Action button on the iPhone 15 Pro, fails the muscle memory test. It’s just never useful since you have to raise your wrist and look at the watch to invoke it. The second-generation AirPods Pro are pretty good, but not life-changing.”</p>

They’re more durable than the Pixel Watch, are more customizable than Samsung’s due to the standardized bands, and darn it, I won’t leave home without mine. The AirPods Pro are overpriced and their sound is underwhelming but they win the field due to their tight integration with the ecosystem. And the new Adaptive Audio features are pretty impressive. On the plus side, no one complains about the white boogers hanging from your ears any more.”</p>

Switching between multiple watch faces was made much more annoying until Apple added a toggle to revert it back to the old method in a later update. The software updates for the AirPods Pro added some really nice features that improved their performance and user experience. I do wish Apple would do something with the over three year old AirPods Max, though—they are long overdue for a rethink.”</p>

I’m sure Double Tap is useful, but I truly don’t think it needed to be tied to new Apple Watch hardware. The most impressive feature of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 is on-device Siri. It makes Siri noticeably faster, and allows you to ask Siri about your health data for the first time. But at the end of the day, it’s still Siri. AirPods Max came out three years ago, and it’s embarrassing that Apple still sells them for $549. Don’t get me wrong, I own AirPods Max and I use them every day. I just wish Apple would pay them just a little bit of attention.”</p>

We saw a minor update to AirPods Pro with USB-C and low-latency audio for Vision Pro in 2023, but another year went by without an update to my favorite over-ear wireless headphones, the AirPods Max.

But the “Store” tab in the TV app gives prominent placement on the main screen to a row full of popular TV shows. All I want to see are movies. The best change in tvOS this year, though, is that the circular up/down/left/right wheel on the remote now works like it should have all along: you can run your finger around it in circles to scroll and scrub, just like using the scroll wheel on an iPod of yore. No idea why it didn’t work like this all along, but I’m sure glad it does now.”</p>

Below my “Up Next” queue are SIX rows of, essentially, ads for content Apple wants me to watch or buy. Only at the bottom of the third screen do I get the “For You” feed, with more ad rows interspersed from there to the end.</p>
<p>“A new season of a show I watch started two weeks ago, and it didn’t show up in the TV app for ten days, despite the apps with the actual show being updated on premiere night. At odd times the TV app still refuses to open Paramount+ shows in the app because I don’t subscribe to the Paramount+ Apple TV channel. I <em>do</em> subscribe to the BritBox Apple TV channel, which often “forgets” to add new shows for weeks or months after they’re available in the BritBox app. The whole thing acts like the only purpose of the app is driving Apple TV+ and subscription revenue, like it couldn’t care less about what I actually want to watch.

It’s quickly becoming <em>the</em> place for <em>good</em> TV; the way HBO used to be. Fitness+ is great, and though they’re innovating slower than I’d like, new features like Stacks and Plans are welcome. Apple Music the service is still pretty great, even if the client apps are so/so. News+ is… fine… but I do like the daily crosswords. So far so good.</p>
<p>“Things fall down for me in a couple of places: value-for-money, and stability. In the value-for-money department, Apple One used to be $30/month. This was expensive, but felt like the value was good but not great. It is now nearly $40/month, and it’s unclear what those price hikes have bought us. We certainly aren’t getting any more iCloud storage, which is still criminally low. Regarding stability, iCloud is still pretty good, but not quite rock-solid. That remains frustrating, both as a user and a developer. Additionally, both as a vendor and as a customer, I’ve seen Apple Pay — which used to be darn near flawless — have a lot of authorization issues late in the year. This is incredibly frustrating.”</p>
<p>Chance Miller wrote: “Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple TV+ all got more expensive in 2023, as did the corresponding Apple One bundles. This was the first year I’ve actually questioned my Apple One Premier subscription, which now costs $37.95 per month! The math still seems to work out in favor of Apple One Premier for me, but the buffer is a lot closer than before. For instance, Apple TV+ is pretty hard to recommend at $9.99 per month. If it wasn’t included in my Apple One bundle, I don’t think I’d be a year-round subscriber. Apple News+ now includes The Athletic, which more than offsets the price increase for me. I’ve been a paying subscriber to The Athletic for years, so this is a big win in my book. Also, bonus points for Apple News+ adding crossword puzzles. I love crossword puzzles, and Apple’s are very good.”</p>
<p>Christina Warren wrote: “I’m not super happy with the price increases, if I’m honest. Inflation as a reason is BS when these services are almost pure profit. If you’re going to raise my rates 15% for Apple One Premier, at least give me some extra iCloud storage or remove the 100,000 song limit on Apple Music. The quality of the services is fine. I still won’t use iCloud as a default file storage service for serious work, but it mostly works these days. Aside from the song limit BS, Apple Music is very serviceable and has good audio quality. (Spotify is better for sharing with friends, for recommendations, and on the Mac. Apple Music remains unusable on the Mac.) Apple TV+ is not HBO, but it has quietly made a name for itself for high quality programming. The notable thing to me, is that individually, not a single Apple service (except <em>maybe</em> AppleCare) is best-in-class.

But I’ll repeat this gripe from previous years: it’s miserly that Apple is still offering only a mere 5 GB of storage at the free tier, and have left the paid-tier storage allotments unchanged since like forever. I wonder how many zillions of iPhone users out there don’t have device backups because they only have a free iCloud account with 5 GB?

It’s also still incredible that the starting free tier for iCloud is 5 GB. As I have written in previous years, Apple should give some percentage of any Apple mobile device you purchase as free storage. They should probably simply make the 50 GB iCloud free to anyone who buys any Apple mobile device ever, drop the 50 GB and 200 GB iCloud+ tiers, and move to 500 GB, 2 TB, 6 GB, and 12 TB as the only paid tiers.”</p>

Apple eventually relaunched the new architecture with iOS 16.4, but has anyone actually noticed any material improvements? On the bright side, Apple released a new full-size HomePod in 2023.

A big part of that is down to the devices you plug into it, and I changed every lightbulb in my house to Philips Hue late in the year because the Nanoleaf bulbs were just too unreliable, but the Home app’s automations and dashboard are much more consistent and reliable than ever before. Apple still needs to improve automations though — it’s bonkers that I need to use a third party app to hack multiple conditions into an automation and there still isn’t an optimal way to set up motion-sensor-based lighting automations without resorting to a lot of convoluted workarounds.”</p>

And that’s when the limits don’t mysteriously disappear due to a bug.</p>
<p>“Or consider how a screen time request for more time appears on Apple Watch, yet the options provided are all non-functional. You can pick something like ‘Approve for 15 minutes’ and it does nothing, you have to take out your phone and do it there. Another example is the Books app overhaul: They made it much worse, and a bug made it so that the books I was reading didn’t show up anywhere in a list. About a week later, the “Continue” list started to appear with the books I had touched since the app update. By then I had made a new collection of books that I was actively reading so I wouldn’t have to depend on Apple to track that for me. Beyond that, the entire ‘Read Now’ tab is almost entirely ads, which mirrors the awful overhaul of the TV app some years back. This is not a good experience.

<p>James Thomson wrote: “Minus one point for the state of the screensaver framework in Sonoma alone.”</p>
<p>Rob Griffiths wrote: “The number of old, unfixed bugs is staggering, and their lack of attention to UI details in the OS is troubling.”</p>
<p>Dan Moren wrote: “Better than expected, but still needs a lot of work tightening up loose functionality and squashing bugs.”</p>
<p>John Siracusa wrote: “Several performance and correctness regressions in the macOS window manager have compounded the longstanding bugs in basic macOS features. It’s death by a thousand cuts, with an occasional (temporary) severing of an entire limb. iOS and iPadOS are doing better, but they have the same kinds of problems as macOS. My family’s Screen Time information still doesn’t match up across multiple devices. I don’t even bother looking anymore because the numbers never agree. Screen Time is not a new feature, and it still doesn’t quite work.”</p>
<h2>Developer relations</h2>

<p>Matt Birchler wrote: “Thanks to things like generative A.I. sucking the oxygen out of the tech space in 2023, it seems like developer relations were a non-story basically all year. I think App Store restrictions are still something that Apple will have to reckon with (and regulators will force the issue if Apple doesn’t change some policies), and I also think that Apple releasing a brand new platform that should have endless possibilities, but will be locked down by Apple’s restrictions, will bring up these conversations again in 2024.”</p>
<p>James Thomson wrote: “WWDC steadily improves, and is becoming more of an actual event again. The developer labs for the Vision Pro were excellent, and it feels like that half of developer relations are firing on all cylinders. But Apple continues to pick fights with the world in the name of extracting maximum revenue from developers, and it seems like all their chickens are going to come home to roost soon.”</p>
<p>Christina Warren wrote: “Apple is committing more code to GitHub, even if they don’t make it obvious, which is awesome. The Mac Game Porting Toolkit was the best surprise from WWDC. The Epic lawsuit might be over but the EU stuff is just getting started, it’ll be interesting to see how side loading will be implemented in Europe.”</p>
<p>Matt Deatherage wrote: “I worry Xcode Cloud is the start of treating developers even more as a revenue source than as ‘the symbiotic partners we need for our products to have any value.&#39;”</p>
<p>John Moltz wrote: “The company has fought tooth and nail against any changes to the App Store rules. This not only hurts developers, it hurts customers as well.”</p>
<p>Brent Simmons wrote: “Apple has made it clear that it thinks little of developers.”</p>
<p>Josh Centers wrote: “What developer haven’t they pissed off? Big developers don’t even want to support VisionOS. Independent Mac developers are worried Apple will demand 27% of sales. Onboarding a user onto a Mac app is a nightmare due to all the security prompts. Apple’s developer relations have never been worse and it would take years to repair the damage, assuming Apple even cares.”</p>
<p>Leo Laporte wrote: “I’m not a developer so I shouldn’t comment, but I still hear howls of pain from App Store devs. Apple must fix their approval process: it’s bizarrely capricious.”</p>
<p>Andy Ihnatko wrote: “Developers have been asking for new App Store features for years, but Apple only implements them under the force of a court order. That’s not a good look.”</p>
<p>Charles Arthur wrote: “Apple has really screwed the pooch here. Its increasing desire to cling on to every possible penny from the App Store is making it take incredibly developer-hostile positions. One has to wonder: is Apple concerned that Google will lose its DOJ antitrust case and be banned from paying to be the search default, which will tank Apple’s revenues and profits? Might that be why it’s trying to hold on to every penny? Whichever, it’s now reaping what it sowed: at the time that it wants to launch a new platform (visionOS) it is being thoroughly snubbed by the most important big developers such as Netflix, YouTube and Spotify. This isn’t a good position for Apple. Small developers can’t fill the gap the big ones leave. And they may not want to. Apple needs Susan Prescott (who apparently took over as VP of dev relations some time in 2023) to first persuade the board that it needs to play nice, and then to persuade developers that it will.”</p>
<p>Ben Long wrote: “I get very frustrated with AppStore Connect and some of the other online developer resources. There are a lot of areas that are poorly designed and, overall, those resources are very flaky. A lot of ‘that didn’t work, try again later’ type messages.”</p>
<p>Chance Miller wrote: “WWDC 2023 had a clear focus on getting developers as excited about Vision Pro and visionOS as possible. The developer labs for Vision Pro seem to have been quite popular and useful for those who attended them. Apple never lifted the so-called “pause” on casino and gambling ads in the App Store. I suppose that’s a point in their favor. For the App Store, big changes are coming in 2024 whether Apple likes it or not.”</p>
<p>John Gruber wrote: “Third year in a row with the <em>same</em> comment: Resentment over App Store policies continues to build. Frustrations with the App Store review process seem unimproved. Apple’s goal should be for developer relations to be so good that developers want to create software exclusively for Apple’s platforms. The opposite is happening.”</p>
<p>Federico Viticci wrote: “Based on what I heard from developers over the past few months, Apple really dropped the ball in terms of providing indie app makers with dev units of the Vision Pro. The very people who are going to carry this new platform for the time being given the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/a-survey-of-popular-apps-currently-compatible-with-apple-vision-pro/">absence of bigger names</a> were the ones who couldn’t test their apps on actual hardware. That seems wrong and shortsighted.”</p>
<p>Benjamin Mayo wrote: “Developer relations remain positive, especially for indies, but increasingly many bigger companies are getting rubbed up the wrong way by App Store policies. And yet Apple changes almost nothing until a government forces them to.”</p>
<p>John Siracusa wrote: “Apple has launched a major new platform in 2024 with the Vision Pro, and a lot of the developer conversation around it in 2023 was focused on the kinds of apps that won’t be possible due to Apple’s restrictions. Developers now assume the worst when it comes to dealing with Apple, which is dispiriting for everyone involved.”</p>
<p>Marco Arment wrote: “Developer relations are slowly improving. The tools and documentation are noticeably progressing, and drama around App Store rules and greed was fairly low this year.</p>
<p>Michael Tsai wrote: “The same old issues with the App Store, documentation, and communication. Nothing seems to be getting better. Apple does not act as though it really cares about developers or their success, and developers see Apple as more an impediment than a help in building, maintaining, and distributing their products.”</p>
<p>Alex Lindsay wrote: “I think Apple does very well for most developers. Large developers want to keep more of the income and small developers want to release products at the last minute. For the 70% in the middle, a methodical process that doesn’t try to push the envelope of acceptability is a very stable environment.”</p>
<p>Casey Liss wrote: “Apple’s hubris serves them well (truly!) in so many areas, but this is not one of them. Apple has released a new platform, their first in a decade, and they can’t help but continue to thumb their noses at developers on the regular. Some of this is on the verge of being rectified by regulation and/or legislation. Apple must see these compulsory changes coming down the pike, and yet here we are.</p>
<p>“Given that we’ve had a fifteen year history of Apple behaving this way, even a small amount of concessions probably won’t change your average developer’s opinion. At this point, the same developers who were deeply enthusiastic to develop for Apple’s platforms are now doing so <em>despite</em> Apple. This hubris can be manifested in small but frustrating ways. When the Vision Pro was launched, only a handful of developers got access to developer kits, and none of them were Indies. Even Indies who are <em>deeply</em> enthusiastic about Apple’s platforms weren’t given a developer kit. Why not? I also remain absolutely appalled by the completely tone-deaf website about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/">how to write better Feedbacks/Radars</a>. Feedback is a black hole in which effort and time goes, never to return.”</p>
<p>Myke Hurley wrote: “WWDC has a great vibe this year and I think Apple did a great job in trying to encourage developers to get excited for visionOS.”</p>
<p>Michael Gartenberg wrote: “It’s anecdotal but devs I talk to say Apple has been great.”</p>
<p>Carolina Milanesi wrote: “it will be interesting to see the response to Vision Pro this year. I am still disappointed we have not seen more for Mac.”</p>

<p>Benjamin Mayo wrote: “Shipping a carbon neutral watch is a big deal, even if 20% of that is achieved via purchasing carbon credits.”</p>
<p>Myke Hurley wrote: “I was really impressed by the Carbon Neutral advancements this year, and want to give them top marks for this. But overall I feel like it has become too complicated to be able to judge a company of this size as being a net ‘good’ for the world.”</p>
<p>Rosemary Orchard wrote: “They’re working really hard on being environmentally sustainable, which all large companies should do.”</p>
<p>Quinn Nelson wrote: “Apple 2030 is a noble goal, but I hope Mother Nature doesn’t find out Apple’s stance on right-to-repair.”</p>
<p>Michael Gartenberg wrote: “With the exception of education. Apple is still pushing iPads that are costly, can’t be shared and need an expensive keyboard to really make them useful.”</p>
<p>Casey Liss wrote: “Apple’s reliance on China continues to trouble me. However, its renewed concentration on doing what’s right for the environment is impressive and worth celebrating. The fact that some Apple Watches are now 100% carbon-neutral — including charging — is astonishing. Also, I liked the Mother Nature skit at WWDC. So phooey on all of you that didn’t.”</p>
<p>James Thomson wrote: “Mother Nature personally gave Apple the all clear, so that has to be worth a point or two.”</p>
<p>Dan Moren wrote: “I’m sure Apple would like us to laud it for its environmental stances, especially its attempts at carbon neutrality, but their achievements have been sullied by criticism of exactly how they’re achieving that carbon neutrality, and they did perhaps too much patting themselves on the back with the Mother Nature sketch. Throw in the company’s ongoing attempts to stymie organized labor at its retail stores, and Apple is starting to feel a bit like the behemoth it is instead of the scrappy upstart it always wants to be perceived as.”</p>
<p>Stephen Hackett wrote: “Apple’s environmental goals are inspiring, and I didn’t even mind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qm99OAQ9p0">that Mother Nature video</a>. Less mining means fewer troubling work environments around the world, which is another big win for humanity. I would like Apple to put more of its weight behind climate change legislation in the US and around the world. On the social front, Apple’s response to unionization efforts in some of its retail locations hasn’t been stellar. That’s something worth keeping an eye on in the future.”</p>
<p>Marco Arment wrote: “Apple’s aggressive environmental efforts are laudable, impressive, and hopefully effective. They remain far too close to and dependent on China.”</p>
<p>Dr. Drang wrote: “Still good on the environment. Still good on inclusion with regard to its customers. Still poor on labor relations.”</p>
<p>Chance Miller wrote: “Apple released its first carbon neutral products, which shouldn’t be overlooked as Apple works toward its goal of becoming completely carbon neutral by 2030. The Home app in iOS 17 also added a new “Grid Forecast” feature that shows you a prediction of when your energy provider will be generating electricity from carbon-neutral sources like solar and wind. Features like Grid Forecast and iOS 16’s Clean Energy Charging are still in their early days, but I think they could go a long way toward educating Apple users about how they can be mindful of their environmental impact. I wish Apple had paused advertising on Twitter sooner than it actually did. I also didn’t appreciate Tim Cook’s lackluster justification for why Apple was still advertising on the platform in the first place.”</p>
<p>Shelly Brisbin wrote: “I appreciate product changes that will get Apple to its stated carbon neutrality goals. Some of Apple’s virtue signaling was a bit ham-handed. I would always prefer that environmental claims could be independently audited, and that a focus on sustainability would also address the issue of how often Apple is expected to ship upgraded products. That’s also a challenge for Apple customers, when they consider how often a new phone, watch or pair of AirPods is needed.”</p>
<p>Alex Lindsay wrote: “I would measure Apple’s accessibility programs top notch and the company’s education initiatives near the bottom. Everything else falls in the middle.”</p>
<p>Brent Simmons wrote: “Apple’s commitments to accessibility and privacy remain stellar.”</p>
<p>Jessica Dennis wrote: “As usual, it feels like Apple could be doing more and better. They say not to let perfect be the enemy of good, but since I am not in charge of anything, I feel I can complain with impunity. Is Apple trying harder than many others in the areas of environmentalism, DEI, accessibility, etc.? Probably. Are they doing the most they reasonably could be? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Steven Aquino wrote: “As someone with a lifelong stutter that makes communication trying, it was heartening to see Apple put so much energy into speech-oriented accessibility features this year. The Personal Voice functionality (and accompanying THE LOST VOICE short film) is a standout.”</p>
<p>John Gruber wrote: “Another repeat comment, but another good year on this front: Climate/carbon is the societal area where a company like Apple can and should make the most difference, and I’m hard-pressed to think how they could be doing more than they are, practically. 2023 saw the launch of several entirely carbon-neutral Apple Watch configurations. We’re living in sensitive times on other social issues, and Apple seems to be managing that very astutely and honestly.”</p>
<p>Kirk McElhearn wrote: “Better than most, though they do their share of greenwashing (such as claiming that some Apple Watch models are carbon neutral). And I should ding another point for that dumb sketch they did in June about the environment.”</p>
<p>John Moltz wrote: “I grade on the capitalism curve. Apple certainly cares from a public perception standpoint — after all, Mother Nature helped introduce the iPhone 15 — but it does do better than probably any of its competitors in trying to be less hurtful to the environment. It still falls down horribly on labor relations, which is inexcusable for the richest company ever.”</p>
<p>Rich Mogull wrote: “I upped my score this year due to Apple’s strong security and privacy updates to iCloud and devices. I can finally lock my iCloud down and encrypt everything. That’s huge.”</p>
<p>Charles Arthur wrote: “The attempt to make the Watch carbon-neutral is laudable, though there are serious doubts about the way it’s achieved: “carbon offsets”, i.e. planting trees somewhere, is a business riddled with scams.”</p>
<p>Leo Laporte wrote: “Apple continues to have an outsized impact on the tech industry. Rightly so. They are careful in what they do, pay attention to their consumers, and make damn good products. Their commitment to diversity and accessibility is clear. Considering they’re in the business of filling landfills they do a decent job of keeping it green and I believe they’re trying to do better. Tim Cook gets credit for balancing social responsibility with padding profits. He’s walking a tightrope and I don’t think there’s a net, even if there is a three trillion dollar pot of gold on the other side.”</p>
<p>Ben Long wrote: “Overall they seem to back up their diversity/human rights work with real action. They’re so-so on their environmental efforts but better than most. But to my eye they are, without a doubt, a monopoly that needs to be broken up. We used to complain about Microsoft selling an OS and a browser? Hell, we used to complain about Apple selling an OS and a word processing and paint program. Now we’re fine with them selling the software, the hardware, and all the media you consume? That’s bad for consumers, creators, artists, and society at large.”</p>
<p>Allison Sheridan wrote: “I’m very pleased with their green initiatives, and while the textile bands didn’t work out to replace leather, at least they tried.”</p>
<p>Matt Birchler wrote: “No matter how many offsets they’re using to achieve their carbon neutral goals, it’s good to see the biggest consumer company in the world bragging about moving the right direction here and it will inspire (pressure?) other companies to do the same.”</p>
<p>Michael E. Cohen wrote: “Speaking as a rather wilted flower child, I see Apple as being more of a force for good than most huge corporations, but hardly perfect. I’m rather alarmed about Apple’s move to close down a San Diego office and move its employees to Texas, given that Texas is a hostile environment for women these days, especially those of child-bearing years.”</p>
<h2>Any other comments?</h2>
<p>Dan Seifert wrote: “For 2023, the vast majority of Apple’s products felt like they were in a holding pattern, waiting for the next big turn in their development. The tweaks to the iPhone and Apple Watch were overall pretty minor and the iPad just didn’t show up to school. The Mac is perhaps the only one that continued its forward trajectory this year, though 2023 was far from as impactful as prior recent years have been. Obviously 2024 has already brought more excitement with the launch of the Vision Pro, but I’m hoping we see some real movement in Apple’s other product lines too.”</p>
<p>Casey Liss wrote: “Apple definitely had some ups and some downs this year, but I reflect on the year as a whole as a solid year for Apple. The iPhone and Mac are boing doing extremely well. The Apple Watch isn’t exciting, but it’s carrying on. And Apple Vision Pro! A whole new platform! The only place where things took a turn for the worse was iPad. Just about everything else I think was either status quo or an improvement. My overall rating for this year would be a 4, if such a thing existed.”</p>
<p>Alex Lindsay wrote: “Overall, I think Apple head and shoulders above its competition. However, I think the company is on the verge of losing the elegant solution it once commanded. Every update seems to be more complex without always providing the proportionate benefits.”</p>
<p>Michael Gartenberg wrote: “Apple is Apple. No it’s not Apple days of the breathless Steve Jobs keynote. Yes, product launches post-Covid feel like slick two-hour infomercials that would go well on late night cable—but they do bring stability and mean there won’t be unexpected crashes. Tim Cook has shown to be excellent at what he does best: keeping the trains running toward trillion dollar valuations. Jobs wisely didn’t name someone like Ive as a successor. Apple hasn’t had a moonshot in a long time and I wonder if Vision Pro might be pushing the envelope a little too hard. Stilll, people are making predictions too fast. The 128k Macintosh (as they used to be called) was a flop. It took a Scully to make it work with Mac Plus and II. At the end of the day, Apple makes great products with stunning displays that Apple can’t wait to users to get their hands on. And get their hands on them they do.”</p>
<p>Rob Griffiths wrote: “Honestly, I don’t really care about anything Apple does outside the Mac and macOS. I have a phone, iPad and watch, but honestly don’t really care about them at all, other than that they work when I want them to work. I don’t use them for work, and have no need for the latest and greatest of any of them. New iPhones and iPads are always just some iteration of existing hardware with more better faster whatevers, but nothing that excites me. Another slab of generic metal and glass. The Vision Pro might have been exciting, but not at $3500.”</p>
<p>Brian Mattucci wrote: “I think of how far we’ve come from the four quadrant product grid. I realize things aren’t so simple anymore, but they also don’t need to be so messy. The Vision Pro is a nice example – it’s overpriced and few will buy one. Eight years from now, we’ll have six different models at various price points and feature sets. In an ideal world, Apple would care just a bit more about the user experience. I don’t mean just in each product, but also in how they roll them out. When the M4 Max is announced, wouldn’t it be better for customers to be able to buy whichever Mac works best for them with the new chip? Do we need a new M-series chip annually if the product line can’t keep up? Does the Vision Pro need to cost $3500? How much would it cost without the external screen? Are they out of touch? Apple products have always been priced juuuuust on the wrong side of comfortable. Vision Pro is about twice that amount.”</p>
<p>Dan Moren wrote: “Looking forward to the Vision Pro category in next year’s survey.”</p>
<p>Christina Warren wrote: “A very good year for Apple, largely led by Mac hardware. I look forward to seeing some hopefully beefy Mac minis in 2024!”</p>
<p>Andy Ihnatko wrote: “Super-excited about the Vision Pro. It could be Apple’s next iPhone. It could be their next Newton MessagePad.”</p>
<p>John Moltz wrote: “While Apple has made Watches that were ridiculously expensive and now makes the Vision Pro which is quite expensive but probably priced not that unfairly, I am constantly amazed at how it ships a $600 Mac and a $330 iPad, both of which are really solid devices. The company is a bit of an enigma even now.”</p>
<p>Charles Arthur wrote: “Obviously next year there will be a slot for the Vision Pro. There’s a lot of potential in this – personally I think it will settle down as an entertainment product, with spatial video from sports being a potentially huge attractor. But you need the entertainment apps on it… and that’s going to be one of the big challenges for the coming year: not antagonising developers, and perhaps even accepting less money in order to foster better long-term relations.”</p>
<p>Zac Hall wrote: “You ever think about the fact that Tim Cook could be the first Apple CEO to retire?”</p>
<p>Ben Long wrote: “Re-reading this, I realize I sound very negative. But I expect a lot from Apple and do hold them to a particular standard, and when you’re in the lead you <em>should</em> be held to a higher standard. At the end of the day, I never consider switching any of my devices to an Android/Windows alternative because Apple still far exceeds the user experience of those devices. Sometimes I look wistfully at Linux machines, because I’d love to not be tied to a huge corporation, and to have more control over when and how I upgrade, but we live in a world now where your computer life requires an entire ecosystem and, more than any single feature or product, it is the ‘whole is greater than the sum of its parts’ quality of the Apple ecosystem that keeps me on-board.”</p>
<p>Glenn Fleishman wrote: “This felt like the year of ‘no fuss.’ Despite my iCloud sync problems, I had to think the least about problems with Apple and felt the best about buying new hardware that I have since 2020?”</p>
<p>Federico Viticci wrote: “As we close the book on 2023 and look forward to 2024, a big question looms over Apple: are they really ‘late’ to AI, or were they waiting to release a more useful application of AI with LLM-powered iOS features that are going to benefit hundreds of millions of people in ways that go beyond texting with a chatbot? I want to believe that Apple’s rumored rethinking of iOS 18 around artificial intelligence will see Shortcuts take a prominent role and allow users to control their devices and apps in ways that aren’t possible today. iOS updates have been pretty iterative and unsurprising for the past few years, and iOS 17 was no exception. That’s not a bad thing (interactive widgets are great!), but I’m ready for something new and different.”</p>
