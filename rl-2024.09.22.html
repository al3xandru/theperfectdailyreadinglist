Since I built it completely myself, I made my own posting page and it was just a blank white page with a title and a big blank area for the content of a post and nothing more and I loved the focus and simplicity. I also loved doing custom stuff like having this top/bottom design where only my latest post was above the fold in the white area, with the rest of the page below (something Blogger couldn&#39;t do at the time). </p><p>Fast forward a few years and I was getting tired of maintaining my own code and I was loving <a href="https://movabletype.org/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">Movable Type</a> for every other blog I wrote on, so I created a hybrid site where Movable Type handled all my blogging entires, but it spit out files I could include in custom templates, letting me make my site do anything I wanted.</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1956" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 2184w"/></figure><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1994" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 2170w"/></figure><p>This 2004-era version of the site was probably my absolute favorite. I spent months working with various APIs to build the right sidebar dynamically. </p><p>This was the early era of Web 2.0 where anyone could finally create things on the internet by just clicking buttons and filling out forms on web apps. But as I used these services, I got kind of bummed when thinking how I was posting but not on my personal site. To combat this, I used all the data sharing features of Web 2.0  to pull in my recent music listens, upcoming events I was attending, longer essays I wrote, my daily photo, a blogroll, my Flickr photos, and even links to comments I made on <em>other</em> sites. </p><p><strong>I called this iteration &#34;The Temple of Ego&#34; and it felt like the ultimate expression of what a personal blog could do for the owner.</strong> If you wanted to know who I was, you could scroll down the sidebar and get a pretty complete picture of <em>every single thing</em> I was doing online at the time.</p><p><em>(plus: how cool was it to use old timey wallpapers on a modern blog?)</em></p><p>A year or so later, I got tired of fiddling with my own code again so I moved this site to <a href="https://www.typepad.com/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">TypePad</a>, which was a hosted version of Movable Type. This was huge for me, because it was the first time I ever used an outside service for hosting all my content. I still made my own custom templates at Typepad, but I didn&#39;t have to run my own server, and I instantly felt relieved.</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2133" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 2018w"/><figcaption><span>This site in 2007</span></figcaption></figure><p>Around 2010, I grew tired of Typepad&#39;s stagnant features and decided to finally go all-in on Wordpress. I&#39;d played with Wordpress since the early days but didn&#39;t move my personal site to it until I felt like it was miles ahead of everything else.</p><p>And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve used for the last 15 years to maintain this blog. Until today, as I&#39;ve moved to <a href="https://ghost.org/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">Ghost</a>.</p><h2 id="picking-a-blogging-system-in-2024">Picking a blogging system in 2024</h2><p>Blogging is in a pretty weird place these days and while there are a ton of small blogging engines on GitHub just a few giant players remain on the hosted side. I felt like Wordpress has grown long in the tooth, and I was no longer having fun with the extremely-locked-down nature of Wordpress.com so I began to look for other options.</p><p>You <em>could</em> say blogging is going through a bit of resurgence, in the form of newsletters. And while I would never touch a service like substack, or even move to only sending email newsletters, I <em>was</em> interested in finding tools that could combine blogging and email in modern ways as I admit there really isn&#39;t much difference between a blog post and a blog post delivered via email newsletter.</p><p>The big thing that made me slap down a credit card and spend three days importing 3,500 posts from the past 25 years was seeing their posting page, which looks like a modern version of the very same thing I built for myself in 2001.</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-10.07.04-PM-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1686" height="619" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-10.07.04-PM-1.png 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-10.07.04-PM-1.png 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-10.07.04-PM-1.png 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-10.07.04-PM-1.png 1686w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"/><figcaption><span>A screenshot of the new post page at Ghost</span></figcaption></figure><p>Today I finished importing all the old posts (thanks Greg and Mark) and got copies of every photo and image for all those posts. I also imported my old pieces from Medium.com, which you might spot in archives.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>If you want to follow along and get all my new posts over email, hit the subscribe link on the front page of this site.</p></div><p>Ghost so far has been fun and I like the design of most templates. I&#39;ll probably start working on my own custom layout that brings back archives and UI the way I like to see them, and somehow incorporates <a href="https://elk.zone/xoxo.zone/@mathowie?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">my Mastodon content</a>.</p><p>Fun new software means I&#39;m happy to write more often, so expect to see a more regular posting cadence here.</p>

IE they don&#39;t know or aren&#39;t sure if they don&#39;t know and any case don&#39;t want to appear as if they don&#39;t know certainly so they put in the least amount of effort to obscure ascertaition with some fancy distracting magicians hoodwink.</p><p>I think getting answers to nuanced/frontier or non-frontier problems can involve different sets of brain processes and behaviors.  For already solved problems with knowledge thats pervasive throughout society, the solution is simply observation and copying, OR recollection and re-execute from memory.</p><p>For other problems one can figure out through reasoning and extrapolation.</p><p>For other problems no amount of armchair reasoning and theorizing will figure out (frontier problems not yet solved by any humans or at least humans accessible ) it, and they will need to do some trial and error exploration within reality on the path to solving a problem. Thinking in language, recalling by search and retrieval isn&#39;t going to find a solution to the problem at hand in these situations, but humans will try and jam the square peg into the circular hole especially if thats easier to do (and it is) than expending a lot more trial and error energy to do reality based experiements instead of pure clean easy brain processes of keyword/descriptor search and retrieval.</p><p>Search and retrieval with or without words is a very quick and easy brain process, perhaps anything you do that solely involve those brain processes you perform excellently at.  Not all problems solely rely on these process such as analyzing new unsolved puzzles put on your doorstep.  Perhaps there&#39;s a habitual behavior where you&#39;re trying to over-rely on the quick processes and doing the magicians trick to obscure the lack of actual solution with the hopes of retaining social standing.  Instead of slowing things down attempting the slow bog down of actually finding the problem while communicating as such OR making use of human language for its actual purpose and networking for someone who has already solved the problem and deferring to their authority.</p><p>But all and all humans collectively are driven to collect (no, hoard greedily) solutions to problems at or not at the frontier and incorporate/encode those into their brain in a way that the solutions can be searched and retrieved in an efficient reflex like manner that&#39;s conducive to your ADHD speed.</p><p>I suck at language but am good at analytical stuff and because of that I&#39;m not going to put any more effort into reducing this lengthy TLDR literature rambling into a concise conducive to reading snippet.  My apologies to those that don&#39;t skip over this and trudge through this Thesis length reading.</p></div></td></tr>

If you asked me to choose a specific number, sure. But if the task really were just to imagine the concept of a number, unbound to anything, it wouldn&#39;t be a specific number until it needed to be.</p><p>Similarly, when thinking of a cup, unless I&#39;m explicitly trying to imagine a specific cup, as close to reality as possible, it is merely a cup. Not a red cup, or one with a tiny annoying handle that I can only fit one finger into.</p><p>There are two questions there. Select the properties of a randomly chosen cup, and relay them to me. At which point i&#39;d feel like im making it up as you ask for specific properties. Or just picture a cup, squashing, stretching, rotating. I think very much that these mental images are deeply baked into the ways we interact with the world (and are not literally seeing so much as attention to details of idealized concepts). It can&#39;t be a coincidence my mental image having transformations applied to it effortlessly is because of my work with 3d modelling and robotics.</p><p>If my mind wanders into those things, I could imagine the cup morphing between those scenarios, unreality forming into reality. Seeing with the minds eye is not seeing, in a literal sense.</p><p>I believe that there is a sense in which if we were forced to actually see the real world as it is, every detail of everything all at once, as a camera sees it, it would be far too much (consider things like optical illusions, human blind-spots in the visual field). Hence all sorts of mental shortcuts are taken where below the concious layer things are stiched together to make a false sense of cohesiveness out of a distinctly disconnected and incoherent stream of input data. Every sense even has varying time-lag, to the point the brain predicts nerve signals before they come in, hence phantom limb pain etc. It ends up that so little of you is actually the concious mind you.</p><p>Objects in the minds eye are similarly abstract objects. You cannot see every detail unless you decide upon what you choose to see. An apple, in my mind, has the blotchy, slightly coarse texture on the outside most apples have. But is it a red apple or a green apple? It&#39;s somewhere between the two. The digits of my number are a blur approximating all digits, the digits I expect to see, until I look closely. Similar to how the room in your peripheral vision is still the same. Probably.</p></div></td></tr>

Though they are not face-less horrors.)</p><p>This has been distressing, particularly when my mum died.</p><p>But then I discovered two really interesting things:</p><p>1) I can sometimes imagine a &#34;still&#34; face if I visualise a photograph of that person (maybe only slightly more if I took it)</p><p>2) I can bring someone&#39;s face to mind much more successfully if I associate it with an emotion or an action, and once I&#39;ve done that, as long as I keep them in motion I can visualise a lot more for longer.</p><p>A quarter of a century after she died, if I want to remember my mum, it&#39;s a real challenge. She hated being in photos so there aren&#39;t many. But it&#39;s possible to start by imagining her angry (sorry mum) or the annoyed look on her face when she was trying to solve a puzzle game on the computer. Then I might be able to keep her face in my mind for long enough.</p><p>My dad passed away a couple of years back and for this loss I was ready; I have some photos, but more importantly I had spent the previous years learning his face experiencing different emotions. My favourite route to imagining my Dad&#39;s face is to imagine a situation where he might show puzzled, half-smiling amusement or fascination when presented with something he didn&#39;t understand or didn&#39;t work quite the way he expected. I will be able to recall his face in motion, just as my face starts to leak around the eye sockets :-/</p><p>So on the one hand: even now I can&#39;t visualise still faces at all! I struggle to describe faces of people I don&#39;t really know well. As soon as a face is still, it goes.</p><p>On the other hand, I have taught myself a visualisation process that can conjure up meaningful animated recollections that are filled with emotion. I have to do it deliberately, but it&#39;s lovely to do.</p><p>One final quirk: despite all this, I appear to potentially be a super-recogniser. I can&#39;t visualise a still face, but I do not &#34;forget a face&#34;; I can tell you with eerie accuracy whether I&#39;ve seen someone before and where. And I do rather well with the &#34;which of these faces did you see in this clip&#34; type test, and very well at the tests like &#34;which of these faces is this face from another angle&#34;.</p></div></td></tr>

The epistemic integrity of psychological research reads to me as basically castles built on sand, where people get excited about results that seem <i>super weakly supported</i> based on reading the paper, which is often itself laden with a ton of assumptions that don&#39;t seem justified, but people who cite them just take the conclusions the authors drew as established, build their own studies with those assumptions baked in, ad nauseum. I was not shocked at all when the replication crisis hit this field as hard as it did, and since the issue is often in the way the hypotheses are operationalized in the first place, there are inherently going to be tons of flawed studies that are hard to even detect through the heuristic of replicability.</p><p>As far as the Likert scale nonsense, I am right there with you, all these psychological instruments are pretty poorly framed from my perspective, and while there&#39;s some discourse deep in academia about the rigor of various experimental methodologies even in the most broken of social sciences, in practice they don&#39;t seem to care much because it&#39;s publish or perish baby!</p><p>It really doesn&#39;t seem like most sciences are quite this broken, though some are clearly trying. Obviously there are people in psychology trying to do good rigorous science, it seems like institutional pressures are not working to support them, and certainly won&#39;t amplify rigor over making bold claims that get a lot of press</p><p>Like, all this to say that it&#39;s definitely worth taking these things with a massive grain of salt, but if you do that, it can still be pretty interesting.</p></div></td></tr>

In a community of hominins on the verge of developing a language, would they not need, as a prerequisite, some non-linguistic ability to consciously grasp that at least some of the vocalizations of their peers represented feelings that they recognized in themselves? But that, by itself, would not be enough for them to develop a language; in addition, I feel, it would take both a desire to communicate their thoughts and feelings to others (motivated in part, I would guess, by recognizing that it would be useful to do so) and the recognition that this might be accomplished through artificial sounds and/or gestures with arbitrarily-allocated yet specific meanings. I feel that there&#39;s a bootstrap problem in regarding language as primarily a means of thinking that was found to be useful in communicating.</p><p>Like you (and, apparently, the survey compilers) I am surprised to learn that a sizable minority of people report frequently visualizing words as text. On reflection, however, that sounds somewhat like a form of synesthesia, and I occasionally get enough of a hint of that to put it just barely in range of my personal experience - but then, I don&#39;t regard people whose experiences differ markedly from mine as wierdos.</p></div></td></tr>

And now I am not sure if I did a mistake so I go verify that on the calculator.</p><p>I do multiplication in my head similarly, just strip out the words, the numbers just flickers through and operations happens by themselves and I&#39;m done in a second or two when I&#39;m not rusty. Now that I&#39;m rusty I do it more like (60x60=3600, 2x2=4, 60x2=120, 3600 + 4 + 120 + 120 = 3844), without doing any words, I just did that in my head right now and I am 100% sure not a single word, just the steps, I do sometimes verbalize the numbers so what I wrote in those parentheses is the most verbal my process for mathing that out gets.</p><p>Edit: Looking at that, I think it might be easier for someone to correct your thinking if you think in words, but thinking without words is way faster and way more creative since it removes the restriction of only thinking about concepts you have words for.</p><p>Edit2: I think your verbalization there is a ritual for the concepts to get to you. For me all I need to do is see 62x62 and imagine I want to solve it and all those thoughts flow to me automatically, basically a shortcut instead of having a large verbal ritual to piece together the concepts. I never did math verbally the way it is taught, so I am not sure how people think that way, to me this was always automatically this way.</p></div></td></tr>

But most people wouldn&#39;t even try to multiply this top of their head.</p><p>Also this multiplying of two digit numbers I was never taught, I just came to a strategy that I explained with my thoughts. And I used to do these for fun as a kid. But I would only get faster than that if it was something I had memorized, but not numbers from scratch. And I had to constantly try to repeat numbers in my head that I had stored for addition down the road.</p><p>What is usually tougher top of my head and especially if I am tired at all, is something like 68 x 68. Then here first I have to decide whether I go from 60 x 60 or 70 x 70. Since it&#39;s that close to 70, I think 70 is more likely be easier. So I think okay 4900 - that&#39;s from memory right. Then I start to think what I have to take off from 4900 and what is 68 x 68 lacking compared to 70 x 70. So I will think that if I add 2 x 68, it will make it 68 x 70 and then I have 2 x 70 missing. So I need to deduct 140 and 136. So now at this point, this is much easier done in writing but here I frequently have to repeat numbers or redo some steps because I am not certain or I forget. But otherwise 4900 - 140, this comes easily instantly 4760 - maybe that&#39;s how it is for you with 62 x 62. And then now I take 100 off, it&#39;s 4660, and further 36 it would be 4624.

A decade ago each of those would take a fraction of a second and it takes about the same time to calculate as to write it, I tend to calculate the numbers left to right instead of right to left as you are taught since you write it left to right, also more useful when calculating approximations since I just do what I normally do but stop earlier.</p><p>&gt; Not in a doubting way, I just have no idea how I could do it in 2 seconds</p><p>Words are just slow.

In order to get through my college degree, I taught myself speed reading. Now, I just naturally do it. My eye flicks to the middle of every 5-10 word chunk and flies though the text. If you did speech synthesis at that speed, it&#39;d be a incomprehensible chipmunk. So I don&#39;t subvocalize at all. It&#39;d be way too slow. To suppress subvocalization I used to hum (in my mind) instead, but I don&#39;t need to anymore. If something is hard to understand I will slow way down, then the subvocalization might kick in. When typing, I do subvocalize everything, since I can&#39;t write that fast.</p><p>I think this post/paper was more about your personal thought process rather than reading though. I very rarely have any internal monologue. In fact, the rare times I do have one are usually very awkward social situations where I wanted to say something but don&#39;t. Otherwise never. My whole life has been that way. An internal monologue sounds like a nightmare to be honest. Constant talking that nobody else can hear? No thank you.</p></div></td></tr>

For example, autistics generally experience thought differently from neurotypicals.</p><p>This happens, in part, because autistics have a different distribution of synaptic connections, which are shorter on average than is neurotypical. This typically results in an experience of disorganized thought, where multiple different parts of the brain contain independent thought, because there aren&#39;t enough connections directly between them to enforce synchronization. There are enough localized connections to allow general thoughts to happen and be operated on, but they are exactly that; localized.</p><p>Detail-oriented thinking is another well-known side effect of this, because each individual detail can easily be fit somewhere without being lost in the &#34;big picture&#34;. Autistics are usually who you&#39;ll find sweating details that most people wouldn&#39;t necessarily care about, but they&#39;re also who you&#39;ll find sometimes getting lost in those details rather than sticking to a single clear vision. Neurotypicals, on the other paw, can miss those details if the picture as a whole looks okay to them, but they also usually won&#39;t get stuck on them in the process of executing their vision.</p><p>Note that every person is different, whether autistic or non-autistic, so there are autistics who are good at thinking in terms of the big picture and neurotypicals who are good at considering every detail. The fact that the physical mode of thinking differs doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that another can&#39;t be emulated - it just means that even if two people appear to be doing or thinking the same thing, the way it&#39;s actually implemented &#34;in hardware&#34; (meatware?) can differ greatly depending on neurotype, even from autistic to autistic and neurotypical to neurotypical, as the brain has no single switch between fully autistic and fully neurotypical.</p><p>Some of the statements in this comment are based on my personal experience as an autistic, some are based on anecdotes from others, and some are based on this article: <a href="https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-disorganized-thoughts/" rel="nofollow">https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-disorganized-thoughts/</a></p><p>I&#39;ve been informed that the author of the article doesn&#39;t generally do good work, but I&#39;ve personally reviewed the article and believe it to still be sufficiently accurate. Additionally, this particular description of autistic disorganized thought is what originally tipped me off to the fact that the way I think is different from others. If you&#39;re not autistic and/or it doesn&#39;t describe you, please know that it perfectly describes me, which should be enough to understand how exactly the experience of thought can differ from brain to brain.</p><p>Also, psychedelics can significantly change one&#39;s mode of thinking. I use them recreationally from time to time. Somehow, they give me better executive function than my ADHD meds do.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Something to keep in mind is that according to Wikipedia, Helen Keller met Anne Sullivan, her caretaker and the person who introduced her to language, at around 7, which is probably around the age many people with normal language acquisition would start to have the kinds of changes in cognition that Keller attributes to learning language.</p>

The existence of “rubber duck debugging”, and a whole bunch of studies on verbally explaining a concept indicate that language is essential for thought. In rubber duck debugging, programmers tell their problem to an object and this is beneficial in finding the solution. There are studies that show when we verbally teach material to someone we remember it better. Also the act of taking a test increases learning and memory, but why should this be if learning is secondary?</p><p>2. Everything we know about memory tells us that externality is essential for memorizing something. If there’s nothing visual, aural, or sensory then it is unlikely to be remembered. Language acts as an externality even as inner speech, meaning that thoughts can be said in language (ascribed onto the words) and remembered for short-term and long-term memory. A thought without externality seems more like a passing whim, unrooted in any more permanent mode of cognition and thus liable to be forgotten. I can imagine thinking in visuals, melodies, words, but if there is a kind of thought that isn’t occurring based off of these then it probably can’t be sophisticated.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Helen Keller wrote about having memories of being something like a stimulus-response automata before language enabled her to be conscious and think.

I just want to point why your takes are not enough to make me to believe that language is a necessary prerequisite for a thought.</p><p>1. Rubber duck maybe just help with attention issues. All the studies I heard of do not try to untangle the mechanism. People tend to use language for a multi-brain thinking, and in this mode people do not think their thoughts fully, they propose ideas allowing other to support them or dismiss them. In this way they&#39;ve got combined knowledge and experience to do the work, simplifying the early rejection of bad ideas. And I&#39;m sure this mode of thinking shapes mind and in particular attention processes. You need to track which bits of information you told already and which you didn&#39;t, and you trained for that. Rubber duck can be just a trigger for that mode of attention.</p><p>2. I didn&#39;t hear about externalities, but to my mind what really helps to remember it is a number of associated details. I believe that ideas extracted from the memory when some of these details is popped up in your thought. It serves like a key in an associative map. When you name a concept with a word, and then use this word in different combinations with other words building associations, then sometimes your mind just like LLM will suggest the first word when you used words associated with it. It seems like externalities you talk about. Language plays its role with this, but you can achieve the same result without a language but thinking about all connected concepts of a concept you are trying to remember. You can build associations this way.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I surprised my freshman-year Spanish teacher on the last day of classes when he did an AMA. I asked &#34;do you think in Spanish&#34;? This question was nonsense to him—another student got it, but he was baffled by what I was asking. It wasn&#39;t until years later when I found out that some people didn&#39;t have an internal monologue that his confusion made sense.</p>

                  <p>Here is my explanation why language seems to be, while not necessary, so useful for abstract thought: Thinking thoughts with abstract concepts takes up a lot of working memory. We can&#39;t hold many of those in mind at once. But if they are expressed in words they take very little memory. So we can have long winding and abstract thoughts because language compresses the parts of the thought complex we are not currently focusing on, so we can hold more of it in short term memory. In effect it increases our thinking cache.</p>

                  <p>I&#39;m not so much talking about &#34;reasoning using language&#34;, I mean that if you have intermediate reasoning results, you can mentally express them in language, which means you can still remember them after you have focused on something else for a minute.

Some natural languages support grammatical features like sub-clauses but that&#39;s only &#34;recursive&#34; in the sense that attempts to describe such features (using formal language grammars) use recursion when in fact and in practice nesting sub-clauses do not &#34;go on forever&#34;.</p><p>An analogy with computer programming languages - programming languages exist that do NOT support recursion (pre-Algol) but nonetheless require recursion to define their formal grammar.

But don’t you see where he’s coming from by calling the former “the biological study of language production” and the latter “the anthropological study of language usage”?</p><p>I’m interested to see you usually loose points! That brings me joy as a (non-academic, self-employed) chomskian, even tho it’s obviously infuriating people are still downvoting based on differences of opinion in 2024. My view is the opposite of yours: almost every corner of the internet has dismissed Chomsky as unempirical and also disproven by recent cross-cultural studies (??) and LLMs, from Hinton to the Stanford Phil page on linguistics to the Wiki and Britannica articles. I frequently see anti-Chomsky papers on HN and in my lit reviews from the connectionist/positivist camp in general, but that’s obviously a terribly biased survey. Perhaps we all have confirmation bias to see our “team” as the underdogs…</p><p>In terms of debating specifics (no pressure to respond, your outlook is very valid):</p><p>He’s still being cited a lot (160K in 2023 compared to recent peak of 210K in 2017), but of course that could all be refutations and/or non-linguists. Ultimately I absolutely agree that applied linguistics has far more practitioners in the US (the “west”?) today, but I don’t think that’s necessarily any kind of refutation of the merits of theoretical work.</p><p>I’m currently engaged in implementing general ideas of Chomsky’s into a cognitive model for AI, and I definitely think it’s a more productive theory than you’re giving it credit for. For one, the two basic observations “basically all linguistic inference is done by procedurally merging symbols and signs” and “what separates humans from animals is the ability to introspectively index and merge symbols and signs effectively” are essential pillars of my whole paradigm — without them I wouldn’t event know where to start! I think it’s much better than some competing “grand narratives” for human sciences like Behaviorism or Postmodern Relativism, but of course it’s far from perfect and surely has discouraged some valuable work over the years. I agree that it isn’t empirical, but only because it’s a guiding idea/standpoint/perspective and not what Chomsky would call a “scientifically defined term”. UG/nativism/minimalism gradually loose or gain parsimony in relation to our body of evidence over time, but they’re not consistent or specific enough to be fundamentally proven or disproven anytime soon IMO</p></div></td></tr>

First, LLMs don&#39;t seem to be thinking or reasoning if they&#39;re only doing next-word-prediction based on a large training set - so a step towards real AGI might be a system that had an internal map of reality that it was constantly updating with new sensory information, with the LLM as a layer above it that allowed it to communicate the relevant details of that internal map to others?</p><p>Personally, every time I &#39;think in words&#39; it always begins with &#39;how can this be explained&#39; and the actual thinking that precedes that is done with images, diagrams, graphs, etc.</p></div></td></tr>

Ants are another species that collaborate well and are successful. But, arguably, ants neither think nor speak. Unless you want to call leaving a pheromone trail &#34;speaking&#34;? And why not? So now we can consider the issue of from another perspective - what constitutes a language? Sapir Whorf says our language affects if not determines what we think. Perhaps we need to look at language not as what we think it is but instead that language is any system that provides collaboration. And then we start going down an interesting rat hole. &#34;Twitter and Teargas&#34; argues that that extwitter does &#34;affords&#34; people ways to do some things but not others.</p><p>It is a complex and interesting issue.

representations need not be specifically linguistic: they could 
be symbolic but non-linguistic (for example, ‘9’), and the use of 
symbolic non-linguistic representations does not engage linguistic 
resources (for example, mathematical reasoning elicits no response 
in the language brain areas and is preserved in individuals with 
severe aphasia&#34;. Why not go back and question the initial assumption that all language depends on those specific parts of the brain? Why are symbols not language?</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Language is for both. Every concept is tied to a label that is a word. We identify pieces of reality by their common attributes while omitting their specific measurements, and attach these identifications to a label which is a word. It is a unique ability that we have as humans, which no other animal shares. It is essential for rational thought. Communication may have been an evolutionary forcing function on our ability to <i>conceive</i> generally (rather than simply perceive), but communication is still downstream from having concepts to communicate.</p>

A serialized version of language is too slow to capture parallel complex ideas that can race through your brain in an emergency and save your life. Learning how to use words is useful but there are not enough combinations of words in the world for the richness of thought you can experience in a single morning, in a single breath. We have way too many smell receptors in our genome and way too few words formed for the smell combinations we experience daily. We can recollect experiences, or we can visualize generate experiences in our mind; I dont see a reason we would label every internal or external experience and we certainly dont have to forget or not imagine all the parts we havent labeled yet.</p>

The output - or actualization of the token - is simply just the form of communication used to convey the &#39;thought&#39;.</p><p>I guess you could say its inappropriate of an analogy since the LLM must use generated tokens to feed into itself in order to &#39;think&#39; over time beyond a single token. But I would argue that&#39;s simply because we enforce the communication method.</p><p>One does not need language to have a known concept for &#34;objects fall to the ground when let go&#34;. Babies learn this without language. They do not have words for the particular concepts such as &#34;object&#34;, &#34;fall&#34;, &#34;ground&#34;, but as concepts they are learned all the same.</p><p>For thought, all there really is, are concepts, or forms in platonic terms. In our case, learned patterns in the world which correspond to particular sense perceptions. Imagination, or the latent space between the forms, is our initial (and only, I&#39;d argue) mode of thinking. These forms, encoding both logical and sensory - of which they are inseparably bound - can be strung together to form thought. They agree to a type of logic, affording the capacity to extract meaning out of the world.</p><p>It is an embodied logic, not boolean algebra. The logic is grounded in the ground, the earth underneath your feet. It is grounded in the sun, in its heat and light. It is grounded in the logos, or the intelligible unfolding of the universe. The intelligibility is afforded because of its own nature - that it is built up out of real patterns, patterns all the way down. But it also requires the appearance of the patterns in our sense perceptions in order to be &#39;seen&#39; and thus known.</p><p>As such, logic of this sort is found to be based off of the learned patterns of how the world appears to us so as to make it intelligible, affording our ability to live within it. Then you get sensory being mapped into grounded logic and vise versa, so as to experience the unfolding of the logic with imagination, and I suppose the affective state changes it produces are then fed back into the logic. So emotions seem necessary in order to &#39;react&#39; to sense perceptions, so that the logic is grounded in caring about what happens, like a mother does with  a child. Otherwise there is just appearance, which has no qualia in and of itself, and so the patterns that can be discovered in the world have no ground.</p><p>Determining the necessity of the ground of appearances is probably what will determine if we can have AGI or not. We&#39;d like to think computation alone will get us there, or even embodied cognition, but without the transcendentals, its dimensionality of knowing will always exclude this ground, so it cannot know what patterns are most relevant or salient, so it cannot perform relevance realization and overcome combinatorial explosion. So AI cannot be a temporal embodied agent, since the logos of the world is incomprehensible, except through itself, of which we Beings are made out of. We rely on lower order logic, such as math, for our AI. It is how we make sense of the real patterns we see in the world, but they are an abstraction over the thing itself. So a machine is confined by boolean algebra, while we are confined by the logos itself. Sounds  nice anyhow.</p></div></td></tr>

<p>Somewhere, right now, a technology executive tells their directors: “we
    need a way to measure the productivity of our engineering teams.” A working
    group assembles to explore potential solutions, and weeks later, proposes
    implementing the metrics: lead time, deployment frequency, and number of
    pull requests created per engineer.</p>

<p>Soon after, senior engineering leaders meet to review their newly created
    dashboards. Immediately, questions and doubts are raised. One leader says:
    “Our lead time is two days which is ‘low performing’ according to those
    benchmarks – but is there actually a problem?”. Another leader says: “it’s
    unsurprising to see that some of our teams are deploying less often than
    others. But I’m not sure if this spells an opportunity for improvement.”</p>

<p>If this story arc is familiar to you, don’t worry – it&#39;s familiar to
    most, including some of the biggest tech companies in the world. It is not uncommon
    for measurement programs to fall short when metrics like DORA fail to provide
    the insights leaders had hoped for.</p>

<p>There is, however, a better approach. An approach that focuses on
    capturing insights from developers themselves, rather than solely relying on
    basic measures of speed and output. We’ve helped many organizations make the
    leap to this human-centered approach. And we’ve seen firsthand the
    dramatically improved understanding of developer productivity that it
    provides.</p>

<p>What we are referring to here is <i>qualitative measurement</i>. In this
    article, we provide a primer on this approach derived from our experience
    helping many organizations on this journey. We begin with a definition of
    qualitative metrics and how to advocate for them. We follow with practical
    guidance on how to capture, track, and utilize this data.</p>

<p>Today, developer productivity is a critical concern for businesses amid
    the backdrop of fiscal tightening and transformational technologies such as
    AI. In addition, developer experience and platform engineering are garnering
    increased attention as enterprises look beyond Agile and DevOps
    transformation. What all these concerns share is a reliance on measurement
    to help guide decisions and track progress. And for this, qualitative
    measurement is key.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> when we say “developer productivity”, we mean the degree to which
    developers&#39; can do their work in a frictionless manner – not the individual
    performance of developers. Some organizations find “developer productivity”
    to be a problematic term because of the way it can be misinterpreted by
    developers. We recommend that organizations use the term “developer
    experience,” which has more positive connotations for developers.</p>

<section id="WhatIsAQualitativeMetric">
<h2>What is a qualitative metric?</h2>

<p>We define a qualitative metric as a measurement comprised of data
      provided by humans. This is a practical definition – we haven’t found a
      singular definition within the social sciences, and the alternative
      definitions we’ve seen have flaws that we discuss later in this
      section.</p>

<div id="qualitative-metrics.png"><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/measuring-developer-productivity-humans/qualitative-metrics.png"/></p><p>Figure 1: Qualitative metrics are measurements derived from humans</p>
</div>



<p>The definition of the word “metric” is unambiguous. The term
      “qualitative,” however, has no authoritative definition as noted in the
      2019 journal paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11133-019-9413-7">What is Qualitative in
      Qualitative Research</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many definitions of qualitative research, but if we look for
      a definition that addresses its distinctive feature of being
      “qualitative,” the literature across the broad field of social science is
      meager. The main reason behind this article lies in the paradox, which, to
      put it bluntly, is that researchers act as if they know what it is, but
      they cannot formulate a coherent definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An alternate definition we’ve heard is that qualitative metrics measure
      quality, while quantitative metrics measure quantity. We’ve found this
      definition problematic for two reasons: first, the term “qualitative
      metric” includes the term <i>metric</i>, which implies that the output is a
      <i>quantity</i> (i.e., a measurement). Second, quality is typically measured
      through ordinal scales that are translated into numerical values and
      scores – which again, contradicts the definition.</p>

<p>Another argument we have heard is that the output of sentiment analysis
      is <i>quantitative</i> because the analysis results in numbers. While we agree
      that the data resulting from sentiment analysis is quantitative, based on
      our original definition this is still a qualitative <i>metric</i> (i.e., a quantity
      produced qualitatively) unless one were to take the position that
      “qualitative metric” is altogether an oxymoron.</p>

<p>Aside from the problem of defining what a qualitative metric is, we’ve
      also encountered problematic colloquialisms. One example is the term “soft
      metric”. We caution against this phrase because it harmfully and
      incorrectly implies that data collected from humans is <i>weaker </i>than “hard
      metrics” collected from systems. We also discourage the term “subjective
      metrics” because it misconstrues the fact that data collected from humans
      can be either objective or subjective – as we discuss in the next
      section.</p>

<table>
<caption>Qualitative metrics: Measurements derived from humans</caption>

<tr><td>Attitudinal metrics</td><td>Subjective feelings, opinions, or attitudes toward a specific subject.</td><td>How satisfied are you with your IDE, on a scale of 1–10?</td></tr>

<tr><td>Behavioral metrics</td><td>Objective facts or events pertaining to an individual&#39;s work experience.</td><td>How long does it take for you to deploy a change to production?</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Later in this article we provide guidance on how to collect and use
      these measurements, but first we’ll provide a real-world example of this
      approach put to practice</p>

<p>Peloton is an American technology company
      whose developer productivity measurement strategy centers around
      qualitative metrics. To collect qualitative metrics, their organization
      runs a semi-annual developer experience survey led by their Tech
      Enablement &amp; Developer Experience team, which is part of their Product
      Operations organization.</p>

<p>Thansha Sadacharam, head of tech learning and insights, explains: “I
      very strongly believe, and I think a lot of our engineers also really
      appreciate this, that engineers aren&#39;t robots, they&#39;re humans. And just
      looking at basic numbers doesn&#39;t drive the whole story. So for us, having
      a really comprehensive survey that helped us understand that entire
      developer experience was really important.”</p>

<p>Each survey is sent to
      a random sample of roughly half of their developers. With this approach,
      individual developers only need to participate in one survey per year,
      minimizing the overall time spent on filling out surveys while still
      providing a statistically significant representative set of data results.
      The Tech Enablement &amp; Developer Experience team is also responsible for
      analyzing and sharing the findings from their surveys with leaders across
      the organization.</p>

<section id="AdvocatingForQualitativeMetrics">
<h2>Advocating for qualitative metrics</h2>

<p>Executives are often skeptical about the reliability or usefulness of
      qualitative metrics. Even highly scientific organizations like Google have
      had to overcome these biases. Engineering leaders are inclined toward
      system metrics since they are accustomed to working with telemetry data
      for inspecting systems. However, we cannot rely on this same approach for
      measuring people.</p>

<p>Avoid pitting qualitative and quantitative metrics against each other.</p>

<p>We’ve seen some organizations get into an internal “battle of the
      metrics” which is not a good use of time or energy. Our advice for
      champions is to avoid pitting qualitative and quantitative metrics against
      each other as an either/or. It’s better to make the argument that they are
      complementary tools – as we cover at the end of this article.</p>

<p>We’ve found that the underlying cause of opposition to qualitative data
      are misconceptions which we address below. Later in this article, we
      outline the distinct benefits of self-reported data such as its ability to
      measure intangibles and surface critical context.</p>

<section id="MisconceptionQualitativeDataIsOnlySubjective">
<h3>Misconception: Qualitative data is only subjective</h3>

<p>Traditional workplace surveys typically focus on the subjective
      opinions and feelings of their employees. Thus many engineering leaders
      intuitively believe that surveys can only collect subjective data from
      developers.</p>

<p>As we describe in the following section, surveys can also capture
      objective information about facts or events. Google’s <a href="https://dora.dev/">DevOps Research and
      Assessment (DORA)</a> program is an excellent concrete
      example.</p>

<p>Some examples of objective survey questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How long does it take to go from code committed to code successfully
        running in production? </li>

<li>How often does your organization deploy code to production or
        release it to end users?</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="MisconceptionQualitativeDataIsUnreliable">
<h3>Misconception: Qualitative data is unreliable</h3>

<p>One challenge of surveys is that people with all manner of backgrounds
      write survey questions with no special training. As a result, many
      workplace surveys do not meet the minimum standards needed to produce
      reliable or valid measures. Well designed surveys, however, produce
      accurate and reliable data (we provide guidance on how to do this later in
      the article).</p>

<p>Some organizations have concerns that people may lie in surveys. Which
      can happen in situations where there is fear around how the data will be
      used. In our experience, when surveys are deployed as a tool to help
      understand and improve bottlenecks affecting developers, there is no
      incentive for respondents to lie or game the system.</p>

<p>While it’s true that survey data isn’t always 100% accurate, we often
      remind leaders that system metrics are often imperfect too. For example,
      many organizations attempt to measure CI build times using data aggregated
      from their pipelines, only to find that it requires significant effort to
      clean the data (e.g. excluding background jobs, accounting for parallel
      jobs) to produce an accurate result</p>

<section id="TheTwoTypesOfQualitativeMetrics">
<h2>The two types of qualitative metrics</h2>

<p>There are two key types of qualitative metrics:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Attitudinal metrics</b> capture subjective feelings, opinions, or
        attitudes toward a specific subject. An example of an attitudinal measure would
        be the numeric value captured in response to the question: “How satisfied are
        you with your IDE, on a scale of 1-10?”.</li>

<li><b>Behavioral metrics</b> capture objective facts or events pertaining to an
        individuals’ work experiences. An example of a behavioral measure would be the
        quantity captured in response to the question: “How long does it take for you to
        deploy a change to production?”</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve found that most tech practitioners overlook behavioral measures
      when thinking about qualitative metrics. This occurs despite the
      prevalence of qualitative behavioral measures in software research, such
      as the Google’s DORA program mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>DORA publishes annual benchmarks for metrics such as lead time for
      changes, deployment frequency, and change fail rate. Unbeknownst to many,
      DORA’s benchmarks are captured using qualitative methods with the survey
      items shown below:</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Lead time</p>

<p>For the primary application or service you work on,
          what is your lead time for changes (that is, how long does it take to go
          from code committed to code successfully running in production)?</p>

<div>
<p> More than six months</p>

<p> One to six months</p>

<p> One week to one month</p>

<p> One day to one week</p>

<p> Less than one day</p>

<p> Less than one hour</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>Deploy frequency</p>

<p>For the primary application or service you
          work on, how often does your organization deploy code to production or
          release it to end users?</p>

<div>
<p>Fewer than once per six months</p>

<p>Between once per month and once every six months</p>

<p>Between once per week and once per month</p>

<p>Between once per day and once per week</p>

<p>Between once per hour and once per day</p>

<p>On demand (multiple deploys per day)</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>Change fail percentage</p>

<p>For the primary application or service you work on, what
          percentage of changes to production or releases to users result in
          degraded service (for example, lead to service impairment or service
          outage) and subsequently require remediation (for example, require a
          hotfix, rollback, fix forward, patch)?</p>

<div>
<p>0–15%</p>

<p>16–30%</p>

<p>31–45%</p>

<p>46–60%</p>

<p>61–75%</p>

<p>76–100%</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>Time to restore</p>

<p>For the primary application or service you work on, how long
          does it generally take to restore service when a service incident or a
          defect that impacts users occurs (for example, unplanned outage, service
          impairment)?</p>

<div>
<p>More than six months</p>

<p>One to six months</p>

<p>One week to one month</p>

<p>One day to one week</p>

<p>Less than one day</p>

<p>Less than one hour</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We’ve found that the ability to collect attitudinal and behavioral data
      <i>at the same time</i> is a powerful benefit of qualitative measurement.</p>

<p>For example, behavioral data might show you that your release process
      is fast and efficient. But only attitudinal data could tell you whether it
      is smooth and painless, which has important implications for developer
      burnout and retention.</p>

<p>To use a non-tech analogy: imagine you are feeling sick and visit a
      doctor. The doctor takes your blood pressure, your temperature, your heart
      rate, and they say “Well, it looks like you’re all good. There’s nothing
      wrong with you.” You would be taken aback! You&#39;d say, “Wait, I’m telling
      you that something feels wrong.”</p>
</section>

<section id="TheBenefitsOfQualitativeMetrics">
<h2>The benefits of qualitative metrics</h2>

<p>One argument for qualitative metrics is that they avoid subjecting
      developers to the feeling of “being measured” by management. While we’ve
      found this to be true – especially when compared to metrics derived from
      developers’ Git or Jira data – it doesn’t address the main objective
      benefits that qualitative approaches can provide.</p>

<p>There are three main benefits of qualitative metrics when it comes to
      measuring developer productivity:</p>

<section id="QualitativeMetricsAllowYouToMeasureThingsThatAreOtherwiseUnmeasurable">
<h3>Qualitative metrics allow you to measure things that are otherwise
      unmeasurable</h3>

<p>System metrics like lead time and deployment volume capture what’s
      happening in our pipelines or ticketing systems. But there are many more
      aspects of developers’ work that need to be understood in order to improve
      productivity: for example, whether developers are able to stay in the flow
      or work or easily navigate their codebases. Qualitative metrics let you
      measure these intangibles that are otherwise difficult or impossible to
      measure.</p>

<p>An interesting example of this is technical debt. At Google, a study to
      identify metrics for technical debt included an analysis of 117 metrics
      that were proposed as potential indicators. To the disappointment of
      Google researchers, no single metric or combination of metrics were found
      to be valid indicators (for more on how Google measures technical debt,
      <a href="https://getdx.com/podcast/developer-productivity-at-google/">listen to this interview</a>). </p>

<p>While there may exist an undiscovered objective metric for technical
      debt, one can suppose that this may be impossible due to the fact that
      assessment of technical debt relies on the comparison between the current
      state of a system or codebase versus its imagined ideal state. In other
      words, human judgment is essential.</p>
</section>

<section id="QualitativeMetricsProvideMissingVisibilityAcrossTeamsAndSystems">
<h3>Qualitative metrics provide missing visibility across teams and
      systems</h3>

<p>Metrics from ticketing systems and pipelines give us visibility into
      some of the work that developers do. But this data alone cannot give us
      the full story. Developers do a lot of work that’s not captured in tickets
      or builds: for example, designing key features, shaping the direction of a
      project, or helping a teammate get onboarded.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to gain visibility into all these activities through
      data from our systems alone. And even if we could theoretically collect
      all the data through systems, there are additional challenges to capturing
      metrics through instrumentation.</p>

<p>One example is the difficulty of normalizing metrics across different
      team workflows. For example, if you’re trying to measure how long it takes
      for tasks to go from start to completion, you might try to get this data
      from your ticketing tool. But individual teams often have different
      workflows that make it difficult to produce an <i>accurate</i> metric. In
      contrast, simply asking developers how long tasks typically take can be
      much simpler.</p>

<p>Another common challenge is cross-system visibility. For example, a
      small startup can measure TTR (time to restore) using just an issue
      tracker such as Jira. A large organization, however, will likely need to
      consolidate and cross-attribute data across planning systems and deployment
      pipelines in order to gain end-to-end system visibility. This can be a
      yearlong effort, whereas capturing this data from developers can provide a
      baseline quickly.</p>
</section>

<section id="QualitativeMetricsProvideContextForQuantitativeData">
<h3>Qualitative metrics provide context for quantitative data</h3>

<p>As technologists, it is easy to focus heavily on quantitative measures.
      They seem clean and clear, afterall. There is a risk, however, that the
      full story isn’t being told without richer data and that this may lead us
      into focusing on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>One example of this is code review: a typical optimization is to try to
      speed up the code review. This seems logical as waiting for a code review
      can cause wasted time or unwanted context switching. We could measure the
      time it takes for reviews to be completed and incentivize teams to improve
      it. But this approach may encourage negative behavior: reviewers rushing
      through reviews or developers not finding the right experts to perform
      reviews.</p>

<p>Code reviews exist for an important purpose: to ensure high quality
      software is delivered. If we do a more holistic analysis – focusing on the
      outcomes of the process rather than just speed – we find that optimization
      of code review must ensure good code quality, mitigation of security
      risks, building shared knowledge across team members, as well as ensuring
      that our coworkers aren’t stuck waiting. Qualitative measures can help us
      assess whether these outcomes are being met.</p>

<p>Another example is developer onboarding processes. Software development
      is a team activity. Thus if we only measure individual output metrics such
      as the rate new developers are committing or time to first commit, we miss
      important outcomes e.g. whether we are fully utilizing the ideas the
      developers are bringing, whether they feel safe to ask questions and if
      they are collaborating with cross-functional peers.</p>
</section>

<section id="HowToCaptureQualitativeMetrics">
<h2>How to capture qualitative metrics</h2>

<p>Many tech practitioners don’t realize how difficult it is to write good
      survey questions and design good survey instruments. In fact, there are
      whole fields of study related to this, such as psychometrics and
      industrial psychology. It is important to bring or build expertise here
      when possible.</p>

<p>Below are few good rules for writing surveys to avoid the most common
      mistakes we see organizations make:</p>

<ul>
<li>Survey items need to be carefully worded and every question should only ask
        one thing.</li>

<li>If you want to compare results between surveys, be careful about changing
        the wording of questions such that you’re measuring something different.</li>

<li>If you change any wording, you must do rigorous statistical tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>In survey parlance, ”good surveys” means “valid and reliable” or
      “demonstrating good psychometric properties.” Validity is the degree to
      which a survey item actually measures the construct you desire to measure.
      Reliability is the degree to which a survey item produces consistent
      results from your population and over time.</p>

<p>One way of thinking about survey design that we’ve found helpful to
      tech practitioners: think of the survey response process as an algorithm
      that takes place in the human mind.</p>

<p>When an individual is presented a survey question, a series of mental
      steps take place in order to arrive at a response. The model below is from
      the seminal 2012 book, <i><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/psychology-of-survey-response/46DE3D6F7C1399BCDC78D9441C630372">The Psychology of Survey
      Response</a></i>:</p>

<table>
<caption>Components of the Response Process</caption>

<tbody><tr><th>Component</th><th>Specific Processes</th></tr>

<tr><td>Comprehension</td><td>
<p>Attend to questions and instructions</p>

<p>Represent logical form of question</p>

<p>Identify question focus (information sought)</p>

<p>Decomposing the survey response process and inspecting each step
      can help us refine our inputs to produce more accurate survey results.
      Developing good survey items requires rigorous design, testing, and
      analysis – just like the process of designing software!</p>

<p>But good survey design is just one aspect of running successful surveys.
      Additional challenges include participation rates, data analysis, and knowing
      how to act on data. Below are some of the best practices we’ve
      learned.</p>

<section id="SegmentResultsByTeamAndPersona">
<h3>Segment results by team and persona</h3>

<p>A common mistake made by organizational leaders is to focus on companywide
      results instead of data broken down by team and persona (e.g., role, tenure,
      seniority). As previously described, developer experience is highly contextual
      and can differ radically across teams or roles. Focusing only on aggregate
      results can lead to overlooking problems that affect small but important
      populations within the company, such as mobile developers.</p>
</section>



<section id="CompareResultsAgainstBenchmarks">
<h3>Compare results against benchmarks</h3>

<p>Comparative analysis can help contextualize data and help drive action. For
      example, developer sentiment toward code quality commonly skews negative, making
      it difficult to identify true problems or gauge their magnitude. The more
      actionable data point is: “are our developers <i>more</i> frustrated about code
      quality than other teams or organizations?” Teams with lower sentiment scores
      than their peers and organizations with lower scores than their industry peers
      can surface notable opportunities for improvement.</p>
</section>

<section id="UseTransactionalSurveysWhereAppropriate">
<h3>Use transactional surveys where appropriate</h3>

<p>Transactional surveys capture feedback during specific touchpoints or
      interactions in the developer workflow. For example, platform teams can use
      transactional surveys to prompt developers for feedback while they are in the midst of
      creating a new service in an internal developer portal. Transactional surveys can
      also augment data from periodic surveys by producing higher-frequency feedback and
      more granular insights.</p>
</section>

<section id="AvoidSurveyFatigue">
<h3>Avoid survey fatigue</h3>

<p>Many organizations struggle to sustain high participation rates in surveys
      over time. Lack of follow-up can cause developers to feel that
      repeatedly responding to surveys is not worthwhile. It is therefore
      critical that leaders and teams follow up and take meaningful action after surveys.
      While a quarterly or
      semi-annual survey cadence is optimal for most organizations, we’ve seen some
      organizations be successful with more frequent surveys that are integrated into
      regular team rituals such as retrospectives.</p>
</section>

<section id="SurveyTemplate">
<h3>Survey Template</h3>

<p>Below are a simple set of survey questions for getting started. Load the questions
        below into your preferred survey tool, or get started quickly by making a copy of our ready-to-go
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ODvYtgE6AQ6EFmAvdYJWofzDNqg9NH6-kyeH2IHBSWc/template/preview">Google Forms template</a>.</p>

<p>The template is intentionally simple, but surveys often become quite sizable as your measurement
        strategy matures. For example, <a href="https://getdx.com/podcast/shopify-developer-happiness-survey/">Shopify&#39;s developer survey</a> is 20-minutes
        long and <a href="https://getdx.com/podcast/developer-productivity-at-google/">Google&#39;s </a>is over 30-minutes long.</p>

<p>After you&#39;ve collected responses, score the multiple choice questions
        using either mean or top box scoring. Mean scores are calculated by
        assigning each option a value between 1 and 5 and taking the average.
        Top box scores are calculated by the percentages of responses that
        choose one of the top two most favorable options.</p>

<p>Be sure to review open text responses which can contain great
        information. If you&#39;ve collected a large number of comments, LLM tools
        such as ChatGPT can be useful for extracting core themes and
        suggestions. When you&#39;ve finished analyzing results, be sure to share
        your findings with respondents so their time filling out the survey
        feels worthwhile.</p>

<section id="UsingQualitativeAndQuantitativeMetricsTogether">
<h2>Using qualitative and quantitative metrics together</h2>

<p>Qualitative metrics and quantitative metrics are complementary approaches
      to measuring developer productivity. Qualitative metrics, derived from
      surveys, provide a holistic view of productivity that includes both subjective
      and objective measurements. Quantitative metrics, on the other hand, provide
      distinct advantages as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Precision. </b>Humans can tell you whether their CI/CD builds are generally
        fast or slow (i.e., whether durations are closer to a minute or an hour), but
        they cannot report on build times down to millisecond precision. Quantitative
        metrics are needed when a high degree of precision is needed in our
        measurements.</li>

<li><b>Continuity.</b> Typically, the frequency at which an organization can survey
        their developers is at most once or twice per quarter. In order to collect more
        frequent or continuous metrics, organizations must gather data
        systematically.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, it is through the combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics – a <i>mixed-methods approach</i> –
      that organizations can gain maximum visibility into the productivity and
      experience of developers. So how do you use qualitative and quantitative
      metrics together?</p>

<p>We’ve seen organizations find success when they start with qualitative
      metrics to establish baselines and determine where to focus. Then, follow with
      quantitative metrics to help drill in deeper into specific areas.</p>

<p>Engineering leaders find this approach to be effective because qualitative
      metrics provide a holistic view and context, providing wide understanding of
      potential opportunities. Quantitative metrics, on the other hand, are
      typically only available for a narrower set of the software delivery
      process.</p>

<p>Google similarly advises its engineering leaders to go to survey data first
      before looking at logs data for this reason. Google engineering researcher
      Ciera Jaspan explains: “We encourage leaders to go to the survey data first,
      because if you only look at logs data it doesn&#39;t really tell you whether
      something is good or bad. For example, we have a metric that tracks the time
      to make a change, but that number is useless by itself. You don&#39;t know, is
      this a good thing? Is it a bad thing? Do we have a problem?”.</p>

<p>A mixed methods approach allows us to take advantage of the benefits of
      both qualitative and quantitative metrics while getting a full understand of
      developer productivity:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with qualitative data to identify your top opportunities</li>

<li>Once you know what you want to improve, use quantitative metrics to
        drill-in further</li>

<li>Track your progress using both qualitative and quantitative metrics</li>
</ol>

<p>It is only by combining as much data as possible – both qualitative and
      quantitative – that organizations can begin to build a full understanding of
      developer productivity.</p>

<p>In the end, however, it’s important to remember: organizations spend a lot
      on highly qualified humans that can observe and detect problems that log-based
      metrics can’t. By tapping into the minds and voices of developers,
      organizations can unlock insights previously seen as impossible.</p>
