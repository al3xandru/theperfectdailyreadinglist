<p>I never thought I’d be a watch person. (Or that I’d wear blue shorts.)</p>

<p>I didn’t need a watch. I had a phone and a computer to tell me the time.</p>

<p>But I got the Apple Watch on day one, because I’m a responsible iPhone app developer and I knew I’d need to port <a href="https://overcast.fm/">my app</a> to it. I wore it almost every day for the next eight months.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch is a confused product, designed like a tiny iPhone, which is as misguided as it would’ve been to design the iPhone with the Mac’s UI and app structure. The result is promising, but clunky and slow. It could be so great at its three most useful functions — notifications, activity tracking, and timekeeping with robust complications — if only they were more reliable and better executed. Someday, I hope they are.</p>

<p>To be great, the Apple Watch needs to be rethought to <em>do less, better</em>. I see no signs that Apple is heading in this direction, but never say never.</p>

<p>Despite its flaws, owning the Apple Watch has a lot of upsides. The activity tracking, when it worked reliably, <a href="https://marco.org/2015/05/24/filling-the-green-circle">encouraged me to exercise regularly</a> and improve my health. The notifications, when they’re delivered reliably, save many cumulative seconds pulling my phone out to see why it vibrated.</p>

<p>And, actually, it’s pretty nice to have the time on your wrist. Who knew?</p>



<p>As it turns out, some people had already discovered this.</p>

<p>Timekeeping on the Apple Watch is especially frustrating: it gets you hooked on having the time always shown on your wrist, but like most of the Watch’s features, it’s unreliable. The screen stays off unless you tap it or twist your wrist, and if it doesn’t recognize the motion properly, you’re just staring at a blank screen until you get impatient and perform a second, exaggerated wrist motion, hoping nobody’s watching.</p>

<p>Even when it works perfectly, there’s a delay of about a second between when you raise your wrist and when the screen turns on. This is fast and convenient compared to checking the time on your phone, but feels like an eternity if you’re accustomed to glancing at a regular watch and having the time <em>already</em> being displayed, <em>every</em> time. Fortunately, I wasn’t.</p>

<p>I was happy enough with its almost-greatness not to look around for a while, except for one problem that I blame Apple entirely for:</p>

<p>The Apple Watch got me to care about watch fashion.</p>



<p>Apple did an excellent job with the Watch’s materials and finishes, and for a wrist computer, it doesn’t look bad, especially in stainless steel. I haven’t found anything else in the watch world that looks and feels as nice as a steel Apple Watch for under $1000.</p>

<p>Most impressively, Apple’s watchbands are truly world-class: the quality, comfort, and versatility of <em>every</em> Apple band completely outclasses everything else I’ve seen and tried in the watch world.</p>

<p>When I first started wearing my steel Apple Watch with the black leather strap, I kept looking at my wrist and thinking, “Damn, that looks nice.”</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>Nobody ever wears one watch, thinks “Damn, that looks nice”, and never wants another watch again.</p>

<p>I was starting to understand fashion. This was going to be bad.</p>

<p>Apple has aggressively pushed the Apple Watch as high fashion, but it’s simply not. It’s a utility watch, much like quartz watches, that has many useful functions and can be made to look very nice but won’t ever be a prestigious fashion item. There’s no shame in that. The sooner Apple realizes this and lets the Watch be what it really is, the better.</p>

<p>Shortly before Christmas, I accidentally found the first mechanical watch that infected my mind so much that I actually wanted — quite badly — to own it. I had many doubts: Would I look ridiculous wearing it? Would I hate setting or winding it? Would I miss notifications, activity tracking, and weather on my watch? Would I wear it briefly but then run back to my Apple Watch and let the mechanical rot in a drawer?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>

<p>I got that watch for Christmas (because <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffanyarment">my wife</a> is awesome), and I’ve only worn my Apple Watch twice since then (while baking, so I could set timers by voice, and clearing snow, since my phone would be inaccessible). All of my concerns were unfounded.</p>

<p>I <em>love</em> wearing a mechanical watch. They’re functional jewelry: fantastic works of art that I feel great wearing, but also serve a very useful purpose.</p>

<p>Logically, I shouldn’t like these. I’m a usually-rational software developer and computer geek. Mechanical watches are ancient technology that’s outclassed in every objective metric — accuracy, reliability, simplicity, cost — by any inexpensive quartz watch, let alone the high-precision timekeeping and unmatchable connected-computer features on the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>I laughed at the TAG Heuer CEO when <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/03/19/tag-heuer-tags-intel-and-google-create-real-smartwatch-tackle-apple-watch">he speculated</a>, “Apple will get young people used to wearing a watch and later maybe they will want to buy themselves a real watch.” I even wrote an entire article about <a href="https://marco.org/2015/03/20/dumbwatch-future">the “dumbwatch” being doomed for anyone who tries an Apple Watch</a> because I was an idiot.</p>

<p>But I simply like mechanical watches more. I’ve completely converted, and I don’t foresee myself wearing the Apple Watch much in the future — the additional functionality it offers isn’t useful enough <em>to me</em> (your needs may vary) to overcome the far greater joy I get out of wearing a nice mechanical watch.</p>



<p>A big part of that joy, for me, is that this <em>isn’t</em> like anything else in my life, and the difference is refreshing.</p>

<p>Most of my work and hobbies involve technologically cutting-edge digital electronics reliant on complex, inconsistent software, with a typical lifetime of a few years at most. Almost everything else I use and make is effectively disposable.</p>

<p>As software creeps into ever more objects in my daily life and makes them more capable yet more disposable and less reliable than ever, it’s nice to have something that does less, always works, never needs a software update, requires no cables, doesn’t need to be charged, and whose useful life will probably be longer than mine.</p>

                                <p>Like many success stories at Amazon, this one begins with a customer anecdote.</p><p>One evening a few months ago, my wife and I, like millions of other people, were casually flipping between different streaming services and trying to decide what to watch. Neither one of us was particularly invested in the outcome. We idly scrolled, clicked a bit, and we’d sporadically say “meh” at each other’s half-hearted suggestions.</p><p>On the Prime Video application, my wife suddenly became annoyed and asked: “Why are there so many duplicates? Look! I scroll down and there are the same titles, again and again. Let me count! This one shows up three times! This one shows up four times! Why can’t you fix this, Mr. Fancy Principal Engineer?”</p><p>This was a decidedly different tone to the other “mehs” because my wife was genuinely frustrated about this duplication of titles. Fortunately, I work at Prime Video. I could figure this out. I could find out why this happens and then maybe do something about it.</p><h3>Finding the problem</h3><p>The Prime Video storefront works by loading carousels in “page” size chunks. A page is a list of carousels (for example, the page with the “home” ID is what customers see when they start up the application). On the first page, customers see ten carousels and then, as they scroll down, we load the next ten. The first chunk of ten is page one and the second chunk is page two. Every carousel’s content is personalized. Not just personalized to a cohort but personalized for every customer. Even for a given customer, they’ll see different carousels depending on what device they’re on and where they are in the world. Of course, this will make any self-respecting cache burst into tears of rage and indignation. The key space is way too large for any kind of caching or precalculating solution.</p><p>The next important factor is that at Prime Video’s scale, we work pretty hard to avoid holding session state. For example, we don’t store anything server-side for what the customer saw on page one. Instead, any information we need to build page two from page one must be in the paging request. Clients use an opaque page state token they receive in every page response in subsequent paging requests.</p><p>The unfortunate side effect of this stateless approach is that each page showed customers its “best” content. Great titles on page one that are in carousels on page two are still the best and will show up again. This means that customers end up with too much of a good thing.</p><p>A naive approach would be to ask the clients (devices) to remove duplicates. They have all the content, so why can’t they remove them? Well, Prime Video has nine different clients and each client organization has multiple teams. Coordinating this business logic across all these teams would mean that customers will experience divergent content across their devices. The logic is also fiddly (for example, in some factual cases like a top ten list, we might not want to remove duplicates), so replicating it across clients will be met with a lot of angry, disappointed looks and “How could you?” from our future selves when we looked back at this decision. Even if we didn’t mind this, we’d also have to wait for all customers to upgrade their devices.</p><h3><b>Building the solution</b></h3><p>To remove these pesky duplicates without client work, we needed a way to tell page two about the awesome things that happened on page one. We could persist them server-side all in a store or a cache, but the cost becomes mind-bogglingly high at our scale. It also means that by the time a customer is on page ten, we’re checking hundreds of titles against thousands of titles for duplicates.</p><p>I needed a data structure that was size-bounded (so that things don’t get worse as customers keep scrolling) and small enough to pass back-and-forth with every request. I could use the existing opaque paging state token to stuff this data in to avoid any new device-side logic. Most importantly, I didn’t need to find a perfect solution, I just needed to make the problem less awful. Enter bloom filters.</p><p>A bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure. You can put a lot of “Things” in it, and then ask if it’s seen a “Thing” before. The space efficiency comes from the filter storing a small hash of the Thing, as long as you don’t mind the odd false positive. If you’re curious about the implementation details, there’s a wealth of information about this available on the internet.</p><p>For my purposes I didn’t need anything particularly clever. I chose to use Guava’s built-in Bloom Filter class. Over a few days I took this up as a hobby project, adding the filter, and passing it through to an encoded token to devices, which then dutifully returned it back in their paging requests so I could reconstruct the filter and check for Things, and throw in new Things (up to a configured limit, beyond which the filter becomes “full” and the false-positive rate shoots up). Selecting the “right” size for the filter is, as everything, a tradeoff. The more accurate the filter is (more items, lower false positive rate), the larger the payload increase. The larger the payload, the bigger the impact to end to end latency.</p><h3>Testing it out</h3><p>After I wrote the code, the next step was to send it into production and see what happens. Of course, I had to verify that the new experience was better for customers. I needed an A/B test to verify whether my changes were better in some measurable way.</p><p>To run my test, I used our internal version of <span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0">Amazon CloudWatch Evidently</a></span>. I knew that the customer experience must become nicer. Heeding the stern warnings of my Fourth Grade English teacher that you must never use “nice” to describe anything, I now needed to somehow quantify content “nice.” But was that 10% nicer? Six absolute “nices?”</p><p>At Prime Video, we have many output metrics. These are metrics that we can measure for how customers interact with our service, things we can’t directly control. Input metrics are the things under our control, so if we select the right input metrics to optimize then hopefully we would see a bump in output metrics.</p><p>The challenge here was choosing the correct output metric. Reducing duplicates isn’t going to increase Amazon Prime signups, so clearly that’d be a poor success metric to pick. We finally landed on converted coverage as the right metric. Converted coverage is the average number of unique TV show seasons or movie titles watched by a thousand customers across a locale. The theory is that if customers see more unique titles and less duplicates, the number would go up and customers would watch a wider variety of titles.</p><p>After I chose my success metric and put in the A/B allocation code, I launched my bloom filter and waited anxiously for the results to start rolling in. I had two treatments for different filter sizes. One treatment would deduplicate across four pages and the other treatment across six pages. I chose the two treatments based to minimize the increase in payload size, to get some benefit from the deduplication without impacting customer perceived latency.</p><p>The experiment ran for a month; a shorter duration would risk not getting statistically significant data on certain customer groupings (such as occasional customers, or customers that haven’t streamed anything in three months), and I was in no particular rush (this was a hobby project after all). The results were surprising. It turns out that customers don’t mind some duplication if its sufficiently spaced out. The treatment that won out was the four page one. What was more surprising was how much of a win this seemingly trivial change delivered. It drove millions of new title discovery streams and significantly impacted the converted coverage metric that I’d chosen as the launch criteria.</p><h3>Lessons learned</h3><p>So, what’s the lesson of this story? For me, it’s that you should take all customer anecdotes seriously. A late-evening quibble with my wife led to an awful lot of fun puttering about in codebases that I was not intimately familiar with. Mostly though, I was reminded that no matter how big, complex, or daunting your space is, curiosity and bias for action can still be massively impactful!</p>

<p><span>Several years ago on my 68th birthday I wrote up 68 bits of advice for my adult children, and posted them here. </span><span>The bits were extremely popular, and they were widely shared by others. I was encouraged to write up more bits of wisdom on my following two birthdays. On my 70th birthday I wrote up 103 bits of advice I wish I had known earlier, which were also widely shared. The first six bits are here:</span></p>
<p>• About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.</p>
<p>• No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.</p>
<p>• Don’t ever work for someone you don’t want to become.</p>
<p>• Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.</p>
<p>• Don’t keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.</p>

<p><span>The full set of advice was such a hit that Viking Penguin books thought they should be in a book, and I thought so too.

This book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3tTKAlc">Excellent Advice for Living</a>, is designed to be the perfect gift.  I already know it makes a fantastic graduation gift. You can order it on Amazon <a href="https://amzn.to/3tTKAlc">here</a>.</span></p>
