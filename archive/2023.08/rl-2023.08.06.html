<p id="p2">This article wasn’t supposed to go like this.</p>
<p id="p3">iPadOS 16 is launching to the public today, and it carries a lot of expectations on its shoulders: for the first time since the introduction of the original iPad in 2010, Apple is embracing a Mac-like windowing system that lets you use up to four windows at the same time on the iPad’s screen. You can even resize them and make them overlap. If you’ve been following the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ipad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">evolution of the iPad</a> for a while, you know that’s <em>very</em> unusual.</p>
<p id="p4">But the reason this story was meant to be different isn’t to be found in Apple’s design philosophy for iPadOS 16. Typically, MacStories readers would expect a full-blown ‘The MacStories Review’ to go alongside a new version of iPadOS. That’s what <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/iOS-reviews/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’ve been doing for over seven years</a> at this point, and I don’t like breaking my writing patterns. When something works, I want to keep writing. That’s precisely why I had to <strong>stop</strong> writing about iPadOS <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1560342334327427077" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier in the summer</a> and until last week.</p>
<p id="p5">Stage Manager, the marquee addition to iPadOS that lets you multitask with floating windows, started crashing on my M1 iPad Pro in mid-July and it was only fixed in early October. When I say “crashing”, I mean I couldn’t go for longer than 10 minutes without <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1572294229514420230" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPadOS kicking me back to my Lock Screen</a> and resetting my workspaces. And that was only the tip of the iceberg. For nearly two months, I couldn’t type with Apple’s Magic Keyboard or use keyboard shortcuts <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1579889720909520896" rel="noopener noreferrer">when Stage Manager was active</a>. Before it was pulled by Apple and <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1574813313929822213" rel="noopener noreferrer">delayed</a> to a future release, external display support in Stage Manager was <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1570139539926294528" rel="noopener noreferrer">impossible to rely on for production work</a>. The list <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=From%3Aviticci%20Stage%20Manager%20&amp;src=typed_query" rel="noopener noreferrer">goes on and on and on</a>.</p>
<p id="p6">Normally, I would use the introduction of my iOS and iPadOS reviews to tell you how I’ve been living and working with the new operating system every day for the past three months. I’ve always tried to publish annual OS reviews that are informed by practical, consistent usage of a new operating system which, I hope, has led to highly opinionated, well-researched stories that can stand the test of time. That kind of story hasn’t been possible for me to produce with iPadOS 16 yet.</p>
<p id="p7">Effectively, I’ve only been able to <em>sort-of</em> use iPadOS 16 with Stage Manager on my M1 iPad Pro again for the past two weeks. Before that, it’s not that I didn’t want to use iPadOS 16 and Stage Manager because I hate progress; I <em>literally</em> couldn’t unless I was okay with my iPad crashing every 10 minutes. So, at some point over the summer, I made the call to <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1560342334327427077" rel="noopener noreferrer">revert to Split View and Slide Over</a> – which are still the iPad’s default multitasking mode in iPadOS 16 – and I’d check back in on Stage Manager on each beta of iPadOS 16. It was only around two weeks ago that, despite some lingering bugs I’ll cover later, I was able to finally leave Stage Manager enabled and go back to where I was when I published my <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-16-impressions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPadOS 16 first impressions article</a> <em>in July</em>.</p>
<p id="p9">Think about my position this way: there’s a hole from early August to early October in my typical “reviewer summer” during which I couldn’t use the biggest addition to iPadOS 16 at all. The fact that Apple delayed, slimmed down, and kept iterating on Stage Manager until the very last minute seems to suggest I wasn’t the only one desperately trying to make it work.</p>
<p id="p10">I started using iPadOS 16 and Stage Manager again two weeks ago; what kind of “review” should this be?</p>

<p id="p13">It’s important for me to offer this context upfront for two reasons: <strong>this is not the complete MacStories review of iPadOS 16</strong> I wanted to publish today; and, equally important, I also know that the majority of people haven’t been testing Stage Manager for nearly five months like I did.</p>
<p id="p14">See, this is the tricky part for me here: despite the many design flaws of Stage Manager, its plethora of technical issues, and in spite of the features that were cut from it, when I had to get work done over the past two weeks on my iPad Pro and Stage Manager performed as intended, windowing on iPadOS felt <em>nice</em>. I felt like I was back in July, just before the public beta of iPadOS 16 came out, and I – ever the optimist – looked at Stage Manager as the beginning of something new that Apple would <em>surely</em> refine and polish over the coming months.</p>
<p id="p15">All this to say: I’m fully aware that many of you are going to upgrade to iPadOS 16 today, use it for 10 minutes, think it’s mostly okay, and wonder <em>“why was Viticci so upset about this”</em>?</p>
<p id="p16">That leaves me with two options. I could tell you how bad Stage Manager was this summer, how testing it and repeatedly running into bugs and roadblocks nearly drained my enthusiasm for the iPadOS platform, and how much feedback I reported to Apple about it. But that wouldn’t be an interesting or useful story. Or I could just accept the hand I was dealt and write about the experience I’ve had with Stage Manager (again) for the past two weeks – bugs, missing features, flawed foundation, and all.</p>
<p id="p17">I chose the latter: it’s in my nature to optimistically look forward at what’s coming next without dwelling on the past; I also think it’s the more nuanced and useful approach that, hopefully, MacStories readers will appreciate.</p>
<p id="p18">For better or worse, Stage Manager is showing us the trajectory Apple has chosen for the future of the iPadOS platform, and it’s one designed for modularity, power users, and multiple input methods. Plus a whole lot of weirdness. And bugs.</p>
<p id="p19">Let’s dive in.</p>

<p id="p21">Stage Manager is an <strong>optional new multitasking mode</strong> for iPadOS 16 that is <em>disabled</em> by default and not as extensive as Apple originally demoed it at WWDC earlier this year.</p>
<p id="p22">Also available on macOS Ventura, Stage Manager is a windowing environment that lets you use up to four app windows on your iPad’s screen at once, with the ability to organize those windows into workspaces. Windows can overlap, and you can even resize them. Stage Manager looks similar to traditional macOS windowing and multitasking, but there are several limitations in place to – according to Apple – “get things done with ease”. For instance, you’re limited to four windows in the same workspace, and there’s no real free-form resizing. Stage Manager does not replace Split View and Slide Over. Instead, it’s a specific mode you need to enable yourself, and when it’s active, classic Split View and Slide Over are not available.</p>

<p id="p24">That’s Stage Manager in a nutshell: it’s an optional mode of iPadOS designed to let you work with more apps at the same time with a windowing system that resembles macOS, but that’s also fundamentally different from it. As I’ll explain later, depending on what you want from a laptop that supports windowing, this approach has its long list of pros and cons.</p>
<p id="p25">You can activate Stage Manager in two ways. The first is to head over to Settings ⇾ Home Screen &amp; Multitasking and flip the Stage Manager switch under the Multitasking section. Opening this section immediately reveals the structure of Stage Manager with a preview of a sample workspace that shows you two elements you can customize.</p>

<p id="p27">By default, a Stage Manager workspace is comprised of three distinct parts: the actual workspace with your app window(s) in it; the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/16/#the-dock" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic iPadOS dock</a> at the bottom; and a vertical strip of recently used apps and workspaces displayed as live thumbnails on the left edge of the screen. The strip is, along with overlapping windows, one of the defining visual characteristics of Stage Manager, acting as an extension of the regular app switcher (which is still around in iPadOS 16) to give you fast access to up to four recently used apps/workspaces.</p>

<p id="p30">Both the dock and strip can be individually disabled in iPadOS 16 when Stage Manager is active. When you do that, you gain more screen real estate for your windows, and you can invoke both elements by “bumping” the pointer into their respective edges of the screen, but you lose the ability to have persistent “quick launchers” for apps. Keep in mind that if the strip and dock are shown and you resize one of your windows to cover them, they’ll be hidden from view in that case as well.</p>

<p id="p32">The second way to enable Stage Manager is from a new toggle in Control Center – the one that looks like a rectangle with three dots next to it.</p>

<p id="p34">You can use this button to switch back and forth between “classic iPadOS” and Stage Manager, which can be helpful for those times when you’re grabbing the iPad from the Magic Keyboard to use it as a tablet and may want to simplify interactions with iPadOS. When doing that, iPadOS will try its best to rearrange overlapping windows as Split View instances; it should also maintain a record of your previous Slide Over configuration when alternating modes.</p>


<p id="p37">The button also supports a hidden gesture: long-press it, and it’ll expand into a configuration tile that lets you toggle the dock and strip without having to open the Settings app.</p>

<p id="p39">The other key elements of Stage Manager are, of course, the app windows themselves. This is where Apple’s approach differs most from macOS’ existing windowing environment and where, ultimately, you’ll have to draw the line as to whether you like working with Stage Manager or not.</p>
<p id="p40">When Stage Manager is active, iPad apps do not gain any new UI chrome around them to, say, display a fixed title bar or ‘traffic light’ buttons <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/presentation/windows/" rel="noopener noreferrer">like on the Mac</a>. Instead, they get rounded corners, keep the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/6/#multitasking" rel="noopener noreferrer">multitasking menu</a> (the three dots) at the top of the window, and start floating above a blurred version of your Home Screen wallpaper. Unlike macOS, you do not see your ‘desktop’ underneath nor are the windows floating atop the Home Screen because you can grab a file from it and drop it into a window, or vice versa. Windows simply float and overlap because they’re resizable, and because Apple decided this was the way to accommodate more than two active windows onscreen at the same time. If you’re using one window in a workspace and make it extra small, you’ll get a fog of blurred emptiness behind it.</p>


<p id="p43">The floating and overlapping nature of windows in Stage Manager is entirely disjointed from the layer underneath them, which is one of the key differences to understand when comparing Stage Manager itself between macOS Ventura and iPadOS. But there’s more.</p>
<p id="p44">In recent years, Apple has historically shown a penchant for bringing <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/14/#files" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-a-new-breed-of-laptop/" rel="noopener noreferrer">macOS</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/21/#multitasking-and-multiwindow" rel="noopener noreferrer">features</a> to iPadOS and adapt them to the platform with a unique twist. Think of this as the “gimmick” that defines each generation of iPadOS – a unique adaptation that, when Apple does the job well, blends the tradition of macOS and the novelty of iPadOS into something new that is greater than the sum of its parts. If you’re a Pokémon fan, it’s useful to think of these adaptations (the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/14/#files" rel="noopener noreferrer">Files</a> app; <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/21/#new-slide-over" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slide Over</a> before real floating windows; the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/#the-new-pointer" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointer</a>; the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/8/#keyboard-shortcuts-and-navigation" rel="noopener noreferrer">keyboard cheat sheet</a>, etc.) as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dviSbbD1iRU" rel="noopener noreferrer">generational battle gimmicks</a> Game Freak is well known for adding to each of their games.</p>
<p id="p45">This time around, the unique twist of Stage Manager is twofold. The first part is about how you bring in new app windows onto a workspace. Unlike classic macOS, where clicking an app (or launching it from Spotlight) to open it usually spawns a new window somewhere onscreen, in Stage Manager you have to <em>intentionally</em> create workspaces of multiple windows. Stage Manager doesn’t want you to manage windows too much by constantly piling new ones onto the same workspace as soon as you click an app icon; instead, you have to manually add each window to a workspace, signaling your intention to work with specific app windows one at a time.</p>
<p id="p46">This is what I meant by “drawing a line” in terms of whether you like Stage Manager’s design ethos or not. Stage Manager is <strong>all about creating discrete workspaces across the system</strong>. By default, when you click an icon in the dock or launch an app from Spotlight, it doesn’t get added to your existing workspace in iPadOS 16. Instead, Stage Manager creates a standalone, single-window workspace for it; if you want, you’ll have to add that window to another workspace later.</p>

<p id="p48">At first, this seems like a clever way to create a self-organizing system that doesn’t stack windows upon windows for you to manage constantly; on the other, it adds friction for users who <em>do</em> want to create a mess of windows that they understand. Stage Manager’s workspace-oriented design doesn’t fix the underlying problem of managing windows: it merely swaps it. Now instead of managing windows, you’ll be managing a long list of separate workspaces.</p>
<p id="p50">There are ways to circumvent this limitation, which I’ll explain in a bit, but they’re not enough; Stage Manager’s fixation on creating standalone workspaces is one of my biggest frustrations with it. For now, you should keep in mind that Stage Manager supports up to four windows at the same time; as soon as you bring in a fifth one, the “oldest” one in the workspace gets removed and thrown back into the strip/app switcher as a standalone workspace.</p>



<p id="p54">The second part of Stage Manager’s twist on multiwindowing is about resizing and placing windows. For multiple decades now, any desktop OS that offers a windowing environment has offered free-form placement and resizing of your app windows. You usually grab a window, place it wherever you want, and make it as big or small as you want within a threshold of minimum and maximum sizes. As <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/rediscovering-the-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote in the past</a>, I’ve never been a fan of manually resizing overlapping windows myself: after a while, I always find that grabbing and resizing windows becomes a chore – yet another thing I need to manage on my computer. That’s why I’ve long <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1572560178268213250" rel="noopener noreferrer">preferred tiling systems</a> for multitasking or, alternatively, using <a href="https://www.raycast.com/extensions/window-management" rel="noopener noreferrer">launchers</a> and automations that let me resize windows to preset sizes with one keystroke.</p>
<p id="p55">Apple seems to agree that managing overlapping windows is a layer of complexity most people shouldn’t need to fret over, but their proposed solution with Stage Manager is an odd hybrid of free-form resizing and presets that, in my opinion, will require months of refinements in the future.</p>
<p id="p56">Stage Manager is windowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Rail_shooters" rel="noopener noreferrer">on rails</a>. First, there’s no pixel-based resizing of windows: when you grab a window from any of its edges or the pull indicator displayed at the bottom of a window, you can only resize it based on a predetermined set of dimensions based on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Size-ClassSpecificLayout.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">size classes</a>. You cannot precisely control the exact size of a window; you can only move it along a scale of fixed smaller or bigger sizes. A video explains this well:</p>

<p id="p58">As someone who’s gotten used to working with two sizes of Split View for several years, even though I’m surprised by Apple’s decision, I can live with it. The visual effect you get when resizing iPad windows isn’t as jarring as it used to be in earlier betas of Stage Manager; it’s just a bit odd to realize you’re forced to choose between preset sizes that are a byproduct of how iPad apps are written. On a 12.9” iPad Pro, windows tend to support up to 7 sizes on the horizontal axis and 5 vertically, but the numbers may change depending on the combination of the two and type of app you’re using.</p>
<p id="p59">Where Stage Manager’s…<em>opinionated</em> design comes up as a sticking point is in how you make multiple windows overlap in the same workspace. You see, the reason it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1582051126824034304" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a><sup id="fnref-70767-1"><a href="#fn-70767-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup> Stage Manager is that in addition to managing how many windows go into a workspace, it also wants to manage the placement of windows on the, <em>well</em>, stage. In practice, this means that Stage Manager does not offer you real, entirely user-controlled free-form window placement: rather, you can signal your <em>intention</em> as to where, more or less, you’d like a window to go, but Stage Manager will always intervene and adjust the position of overlapping windows based on its own criteria.</p>
<p id="p60">Basically: the thing <strong>moves windows around on your behalf</strong>.</p>


<p id="p63">According to Apple, Stage Manager was designed like this to remove friction from users so they don’t have to think about carefully placing windows onscreen. The problem is that I believe there’s a fundamental misalignment between Stage Manager’s design and the users it’s been designed <em>for</em>. The people who are going to enable Stage Manager to use overlapping windows are, by and large, the kind of folks who <em>want</em> to carefully place windows onscreen. My concern is that Stage Manager dangles the allure of free-form window placement in front of you, only to take control away from you as soon as you try to arrange a workspace in a particular way you like that may not match Apple’s “guidelines”.</p>
<p id="p64">There <em>are</em> instances in which Stage Manager’s “automatic” window placement feels nice because it tries to keep as many windows visible as possible. However, after five months spent testing it in some form or another, I feel like Stage Manager gets in the way of getting work done more than it actually helps. In many ways, Stage Manager’s windowing behavior feels like the multitasking equivalent of the <a href="https://youtu.be/yRj4lxJYGP4" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPod shuffle without buttons</a>: a sleek idea in theory, but a poor experience in everyday life.</p>
<p id="p66">As I’ll explore in the next sections, this is the most controversial aspect of this first version of Stage Manager: it seems to be designed for a middle segment of the professional iPad user base – people who want overlapping windows, but only just a <em>smidge</em> of them – that I’m not sure exists. But at the same time, if you learn how to cope with Stage Manager and take advantage of its core idea alone (four apps at once!) it <em>can</em> be useful and save you a time when jumping around between apps.</p>
<p id="p67">So, now that we’ve established what Stage Manager is, what does working with it actually feel like, and where does its implementation fall short?</p>
<h2 id="working-with-stage-manager">Working with Stage Manager</h2>
<p id="p68">When it comes to discussing Stage Manager’s potential for iPad productivity, it’s important to note how much this feature was designed to take advantage of iPadOS 16’s new display scaling tech.</p>
<p id="p69">On supported models, display scaling lets you increase your iPad’s virtual pixel density so you end up with smaller text and UI elements, but also more space onscreen for apps and content. Available in Settings ⇾ Display &amp; Brightness ⇾ View, the option is indeed labeled ‘More Space’ and is reminiscent of the functionality <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-your-displays-resolution-mchl86d72b76/mac" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macs have offered for decades</a>.</p>


<p id="p72">Display scaling can be used with regular Split View as well<sup id="fnref-70767-3"><a href="#fn-70767-3" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></sup>, but I think it shines with Stage Manager given that you’re going to be placing multiple windows onscreen and thus will benefit from a larger content area. Let me break down some interesting numbers and details of Apple’s implementation.</p>
<p id="p73">When display scaling is enabled on a 12.9” iPad Pro, its resolution increases from 2732x2048 pixels in landscape mode to 3180x2384.<sup id="fnref-70767-4"><a href="#fn-70767-4" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></sup> That’s 16% more space on either side of the device, allowing you to fit more and denser elements along the horizontal and vertical edges of the screen. Here’s where it gets fun. Consider a workspace in Stage Manager with a single app window that’s resized to be as big as it can without covering the strip and dock, like this:</p>

<p id="p75">This is the default size that new windows will use when they’re opened in a new workspace. When display scaling is set to ‘More Space’, the default size of an app window is 2732x2064 – almost exactly the native resolution of the iPad’s entire display. This means that in Stage Manager with display scaling enabled, it’s almost as if a stage contains the iPad’s entire display, with additional content surrounding it on four sides. This is some nice math on Apple’s part and I find how these numbers work together quite pleasing.</p>
<p id="p76">I enabled display scaling on my iPad Pro months ago and I haven’t looked back. Regardless of Stage Manager, if your eyesight allows you to use smaller and denser interface elements, my recommendation is to try the ‘More Space’ setting and see how you like it. I recently disabled display scaling to take screenshots for this story, and I was shocked by how large and wasteful apps looked when set at the iPad’s native resolution.</p>
<hr id="hr77"/><p id="p78">When working with Stage Manager on my iPad Pro, the action I find myself repeating most often on a daily basis is adding windows to an existing workspace. There are multiple ways to do this but, unfortunately, the one method I would have liked to use isn’t supported. There are also some odd inconsistencies that I’ll try my best to cover here.</p>
<p id="p80">First, there’s the regular app switcher, which you can still access with a three-finger swipe up or Globe+Up on a Magic Keyboard. The app switcher in iPadOS 16 shows you a live preview of your workspaces (good) but doesn’t let you drag and drop windows between workspaces (bad). This is one of the <em>many</em> missing features from Stage Manager at the moment, and it’s especially odd given that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/7/#app-switcher" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can combine windows in the app switcher</a> when using classic Split View.</p>
<p id="p81">Then you have the strip. Tap and hold a window thumbnail in the strip, drag it away, and it’ll morph with a cute 3D animation into a live preview of the window that you can drop into your workspace. As you’re dragging a window around, you’ll have live previews for all the other windows in the workspace too, which will bounce around as per Stage Manager’s way of placing things onscreen for you.</p>

<p id="p83">What if you don’t want to use drag and drop? The strip has you covered there too: hold Shift, then click a window thumbnail, and instead of taking you to that window’s separate workspace, the selected window will be immediately added to your existing workspace. Using the Shift key as a modifier for Stage Manager’s behavior when clicking windows is a good idea that, unfortunately, has only been implemented in the strip.</p>
<p id="p84">As I’ve mentioned above, you may be in the situation where the strip is hidden (whether because you hid it or a window is covering it) and want a faster way to bring an app into the workspace you’re in. This is where good old drag and drop comes in.</p>
<p id="p85">In a somewhat ironic turn of events, the fastest way to add any app you want to a workspace in Stage Manager is the same method we’ve been using since <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/18/#drag-and-drop" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS 11 in 2017</a>: pick up an icon from the dock or Spotlight and use drag and drop to add it to your workspace. When you do, the most recently used window from that app will be added to the stage.</p>

<p id="p87">This method works, and I’ve been using it a lot, but I feel like I shouldn’t be doing this: there should be new and better ways to search for an app and immediately add it to a workspace. For instance, I don’t understand why Shift-clicking is not supported when clicking an app icon in the dock or Spotlight. Just like Shift-clicking a window in the strip adds it to a workspace right away, so too should be the case when Shift-clicking apps elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p88">I also don’t understand the visual differences between dragging a window from the strip VS dragging an icon from Spotlight or the dock. When I drag a window from the strip, Stage Manager shows me a live preview of the window itself and other windows in the workspace remain visible:</p>

<p id="p90">Conversely, when dragging from the dock or Spotlight, you get the old-school behavior: all windows get blurred, including the ones already sitting in the workspace – almost as if live previews aren’t supported anymore when you’re using drag and drop to add windows.</p>

<p id="p92">Because of this perplexing design choice, the functionally-superior solution (Spotlight lets you search for <em>any</em> app you want) is technically-inferior to the strip because it’s not the latest fancy tech Apple created, which is a shame. Dragging windows from dock or Spotlight should maintain live previews in Stage Manager, just like the strip does.</p>
<p id="p93">You thought we were done talking about all the different ways to add windows to workspaces in Stage Manager? Wrong assumption. If there’s one thing Apple loves, it’s adding layers upon layers of interaction to existing iPadOS UI conventions; Stage Manager follows this unfortunate tradition.</p>
<p id="p94">But first, another brief aside on the improved and redesigned multitasking menu in iPadOS 16.</p>
<p id="p96">Still with me? Alright. As I was saying, there is a new ‘Add Another Window’ button in the redesigned multitasking menu, which activates the…</p>
<p id="p97"><em>scrolls document back up</em></p>
<p id="p98"><em>counts</em></p>
<p id="p99">…<strong>fifth</strong> way to add a window to a workspace in Stage Manager. Click the button, and your workspace will open with a curtain-like animation that reveals the system app switcher in between your windows.<sup id="fnref-70767-6"><a href="#fn-70767-6" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a></sup></p>

<p id="p101">This transition is pretty slick, and I like that I can also invoke it from the keyboard using a hotkey. There is, however, another complication worth observing here. Let’s say you’re hovering with the pointer over a group of windows rather than an individual one; despite the fact that you can seemingly choose which one you want to add to your workspace by selecting it with the pointer, the whole stack of windows will be added to your current stage instead. Meaning: if you select a workspace with two windows in it, two windows will be added to your current workspace – not one.</p>
<p id="p103">Speaking of the keyboard: it may not seem like it, but the windows in between the “curtains” support keyboard selection too. Use the arrow keys to navigate them and click Return to choose a window you want to add. It’s easy to miss, but you’ll notice that windows get a gray highlight around them when they’re selected from the keyboard:</p>

<hr id="hr105"/><p id="p106">We’re about halfway through this story and, as you can see, I’ve already brought my fair share of practical examples of aspects of Stage Manager that aren’t working right, are inconsistent, or are just oddly implemented.</p>
<p id="p107">I’ll tell you: there’s more of that coming in the next two sections.</p>
<p id="p108">But at the same time, I have to be honest: over the past two weeks, once I was able to get Stage Manager to work on my M1 iPad Pro, there have been times when working with up to four apps at the same time has been useful and, ultimately, <em>nice</em>.</p>
<p id="p109">Working with Stage Manager is unmistakably different from the primitive windowing experiences we had in iPadOS 15 in the form of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/7/#center-windows" rel="noopener noreferrer">center windows</a> (which now spawn as regular windows in Stage Manager) and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/13/#quick-note" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick Note</a> (which is unchanged). Stage Manager tries to position windows onscreen for you (and very rarely succeeds at that) and gives you minimal controls to adjust your workspace the way you want it. When the combination of these two aspects worked as intended, I had an okay time with Stage Manager.</p>
<p id="p110">Last week, I was keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-strange-new-ipad-and-ipad-pro-lineup/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s announcements for the new iPads</a> and I had <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian-connected-notes/id1557175442" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>, Messages, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spring-for-twitter/id1508706541" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring</a>, and Safari in the same workspace. That’s something I could never achieve with Split View and Slide Over before. Stage Manager arranged the Messages window so a part of it would peek through from behind Obsidian, and thanks to the floating nature of windows, I could see that new texts from my friends were coming in while I was doing something else because the window was active in the background and chat bubbles were moving in the transcript. I could see that happening in real-time on the side of my workspace, and that was great because I didn’t have to constantly switch between different instances of Split View.</p>

<p id="p112">The same applies for when I’m researching an article for MacStories or <a href="https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">building a shortcut</a>: I can leave Safari, Obsidian, Files, and Shortcuts in the same workspace, drag and drop content between those windows with touch or the pointer, and take advantage of some of the new keyboard integrations in iPadOS 16. For example, if a window is in the background but a part of it is visible, I can hold ⌘ and click UI elements in it (like, say, liking a tweet in Spring) without bringing it in the foreground – just like on macOS.</p>

<p id="p114">Or take context menus: in iPadOS, you can Control-click any item to instantly bring up its associated menu without having to long-press it or right-click it from the trackpad. iPadOS 16 is full of small, yet convenient desktop-class enhancements (which I’ll cover in a future story) that, when paired with Stage Manager <em>in the right conditions</em>, truly yield a hybrid tablet-laptop experience that I’ve always wanted from my iPad Pro. The list of examples goes on and on, but I don’t need to describe the benefits of multiple windows in fine detail to the MacStories audience.</p>
<p id="p116">All this to say: desktop-style windowing undeniably has its advantages on iPadOS too, which I’ve been able to experience myself in my regular usage of the iPad Pro. The core idea behind Stage Manager <em>is</em> useful to me; the problem is the actual implementation of it.</p>
<p id="p117">This first version of Stage Manager is plagued by several misguided design choices, a confused direction, and the general sense that this entire functionality has been rushed and slimmed down to meet a marketing deadline.</p>
<h2 id="the-strips-failures">The Strip’s Failures</h2>
<p id="p118">Speaking of misguided design in Stage Manager, allow me to go through the flaws of one of its key visual elements: the recent apps strip.</p>
<p id="p119">App pickers on iPadOS are the equivalent of Google’s messaging apps: a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/11/#split-view" rel="noopener noreferrer">new one</a> comes <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/16/#the-dock" rel="noopener noreferrer">out</a> every <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/21/#expose" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/6/#the-shelf" rel="noopener noreferrer">years</a>, lasts a couple of years without changes, then either gets replaced or abandoned and the cycle starts again. With the Stage Manager strip, Apple wasted an opportunity to create a simplified app picker that could scale well for intermediate and advanced users alike; instead, they launched a feature that is both too confusing for non-expert users and too limited for pros. There are multiple layers to this, so let me get through each one.</p>
<p id="p120">For starters, the implementation of Stage Manager itself works against the very premise of the strip. The strip was seemingly designed to act as a handy, always-visible preview tool and launcher for your workspaces. But on iPadOS 16, Stage Manager has an inexplicable tendency to hide the strip by either resizing windows or moving them around because it thinks that’s what you want. So on the one hand, you may find yourself <em>wanting</em> to keep the strip visible at all times, but on the other Stage Manager will make it downright impossible to keep it pinned there.</p>
<p id="p121">Don’t take my word for it: go ahead and try using Stage Manager with the strip always enabled. Even when you have two windows open – and, therefore, technically enough space to make them overlap and see the strip – Stage Manager will cover it. This goes back to Stage Manager’s insistence on “taking care” of windows for you – except here it goes against one of its own features, sort of like an immune system rejecting something it doesn’t know.</p>


<p id="p124">The fundamental misdirection of the strip sits deeper at a design level: it is both overstuffed with hidden options based on invisible gestures, and it doesn’t cover the obvious basics at all.</p>
<p id="p125">For example: the strip doesn’t show you the names of apps and windows; it doesn’t support closing windows or quitting apps contained in it; despite being a new feature of iPadOS, it doesn’t support modern interactions like, say, displaying a context menu when right-clicking a window. Apple could have used an easy-to-discover context menu in the strip to close the selected app, or add it to the stage, or find all windows belonging to it, and they decided against it.</p>
<p id="p126">But the worst aspect of the strip, in my opinion, is that despite its tactile nature, it only supports one-way dragging of windows. In iPadOS 16.1, you can only drag a window from the strip into a workspace and from a workspace back into the strip as a standalone window. You cannot drag a window from a workspace on top of another window in the strip, forming a new workspace on the fly; similarly, you cannot combine windows from the strip itself by dragging window thumbnails on top of each other. As a result, creating workspaces in iPadOS 16 feels clunky and laborious: you always need to remove a window, switch to another workspace, then drag the previous window in from the strip.</p>
<p id="p127">Instead of refining the strip’s direct manipulation, Apple crammed all sorts of window management functionalities into it – some of which are inconsistent with each other. Strap in: we’re going deep into the rabbit hole of window management in iPadOS 16 here.</p>
<p id="p128">When Stage Manager is active, you lose access to the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/6/#the-shelf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelf</a> – the interface element Apple debuted in iPadOS 15 to view all open windows for the same app. The strip doubles as an Exposé-like window picker, with a collection of semi-related implementations. If you want to see all the windows a particular app has open across the system, you have to press Globe-Down (the same hotkey that activates the Shelf) or click on the icon of an app in the strip. Doing this will “filter” the strip to show you all the workspaces where an app has windows open. From here, you can grab a window and drag it into your workspace or click it to open it.</p>


<p id="p131">You can also get to this screen by right-clicking an icon in the dock and selecting ‘Show All Windows’ but, as I mentioned above, you can’t right-click a window thumbnail in the strip itself. You can also view open windows for an app by clicking it <em>once</em> in the dock but <em>only</em> if that app is the one in the foreground.</p>
<p id="p132">Still with me? I hope so because more exceptions are coming.</p>
<p id="p133">Occasionally, you may notice that the strip will display multiple windows for the same app as a 3D stack rather than standalone items. Like this:</p>

<p id="p135">Apparently, this is <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1582866400116297728" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> a “pile”. Stage Manager does this when the same app has multiple windows open across the system but <em>only</em> if they’re single-window workspaces. I’m guessing this was designed so that you can quickly cycle through windows in the stack, but this is my personal speculation. I don’t understand the motivation behind this design; the “pile” terminology is also not explained at all in iPadOS 16.</p>
<p id="p136">Parts of the strip also bleed into the classic app switcher (i.e. the grid of open apps). In iPadOS 16, if you click on the tiny app icons underneath window thumbnails in the app switcher, you’ll get a filtered view similar to the strip that shows you all the windows currently open for the selected app. The only problem: in the public version of iPadOS 16.1, sometimes you may click one of those small icons and find yourself staring at an empty screen:</p>

<p id="p138">As it turns out, a bug causes this view to be <em>scrolled</em>, hiding your windows. Swipe right on the trackpad, and your windows will appear:</p>

<p id="p140">Lastly, the strip also serves as the area where the only iPadOS UI element to create new windows for an app exists. The only problem: this is another half-baked feature that has been implemented exactly backwards from the way I would expect it.</p>
<p id="p141">In iPadOS 16.1, there is no system-wide keyboard shortcut accepted by all apps to ‘Create New Window’. Instead, the only way to reliably create a new window is to ‘Show All Windows’ first, then click a ‘+’ button displayed at the top of the strip:</p>

<p id="p143">That’s right: to create a new window for an app, you have to find its other windows first and – <em>of course</em> – the window gets created in a separate workspace, losing your current context. Given the fresh start that Stage Manager presented, Apple could have gone for a new system-wide keyboard shortcut, or a more discoverable ‘Create New Window’ button in an app’s context menu, or, heck, even a Shortcuts action; instead, they hid the button to create a new window behind a filtered view of the strip. Who’s going to find it?</p>
<hr id="hr144"/><p id="p145">This is how I feel about the Stage Manager strip: it doesn’t do what I’d expect it to do as a pro user, and the things it does are either inconsistent, in the wrong place, or too difficult to discover. From a design and functional standpoint, it feels like it gets pulled in too many directions with no clear vision behind it. Credit where credit’s due, I suppose: at the very least, that perfectly encapsulates the current state of Stage Manager in iPadOS 16.1.</p>
<h2 id="stage-managers-flawed-design-bugs-and-litany-of-missing-features">Stage Manager’s Flawed Design, Bugs, and Litany of Missing Features</h2>
<p id="p146">I don’t think I’ve made it obvious enough to understand the sheer amount of technical issues and challenges I’ve encountered while trying to work with Stage Manager.</p>
<p id="p147">For context and posterity, let me lay them all out. What follows is a list of fundamental design problems that Apple will need to rethink, features that are missing from Stage Manager right now, and bugs that made it to the shipping version of Stage Manager in iPadOS 16.1.</p>
<p id="p148"><strong>Grabbing windows is too difficult.</strong> Five months into Stage Manager, I still struggle to perform one of its most basic actions: grabbing windows with the pointer to move them around.</p>
<p id="p149">Stage Manager was added to iPadOS as a mode that was meant to “just work” with the existing design of iPad apps with no further optimizations in terms of design and developer technologies. As a <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith" rel="noopener noreferrer">friend</a> recently put it: windows happen to iPad apps under Stage Manager. Developers have no idea that their apps are running in windowed mode, and they cannot specifically optimize their app’s experience or design for Stage Manager.</p>
<p id="p150">Visually speaking, this means that iPad apps in Stage Manager do not change their appearance to accommodate a title bar that serves as a clear anchor point for users to place their fingers/pointer and grab a window. Per Apple’s HIG parlance, iPad windows in Stage Manager <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/presentation/windows/" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t have a frame</a>.</p>


<p id="p153">Instead, you have to guess that the “title bar” you can use to pick a window up and move it around is the invisible area around the multitasking menu that is not delimited by <em>anything</em>. There is no visual indicator that tells you “this is where you can grab a window”. You <em>could</em> grab the multitasking dots as a shortcut, and that sometimes work, but you also risk accidentally triggering the multitasking menu if you do that, which is not ideal.</p>
<p id="p154">Once again, it comes down to the fact that Stage Manager was tacked onto the existing design of iPad apps without a redesign of the UI chrome that goes around windows – because, typically, there is none on iPadOS. Apple could have created an API for developers to add a title bar with proper multitasking controls to their apps, but they didn’t. They could have supported the “sloppy” gestures of the Quick Note floating panel to move windows around with two-finger swipes, but they didn’t. With Stage Manager windows, Apple wants to have their cake and eat it too: they’re hoping that Stage Manager’s automatic window placement will eschew the need to move windows around manually, but, at the same time, they’re also hoping that users will somehow figure out where windows are supposed to be grabbed.</p>
<p id="p155">This approach is not good enough.</p>
<p id="p156"><strong>Sometimes when I grab a window to place it on the left of the screen, I activate the strip instead.</strong> Speaking of moving windows around, I’ve noticed that I frequently activate the strip by accident when trying to place a window on the left side of the screen. The best part? If you accidentally trigger the strip, the animation will reset the window size you set for the item you’re dragging, forcing you to resize the window manually again.</p>

<p id="p158"><strong>You can “freely” move windows around, but only horizontally, and only in the right conditions.</strong> Speaking of moving windows: Stage Manager does support pixel-based repositioning to place a window exactly where you want it, but this method only works on the x-axis and <em>only</em> if a window in the background is covering “enough space” to justify this necessity.</p>
<p id="p159">There doesn’t seem to be a a precise rule here, and it’s difficult to describe this in an article. A good way to understand what I mean, however, is the following: make a window as large as it can be, then place a floating window on top of it. In this case, because the background window is covering a lot of space, the foreground one can be moved with pixel-precision, but only horizontally.</p>

<p id="p161">This half-baked, obscure system is not good enough either.</p>
<p id="p162"><strong>Creating a new window for an app in the same workspace is impossible.</strong> Imagine that you’re on a Mac, you’re using Safari, and you want to create a new, separate Safari window next to the current one. It’s easy enough: you can either click File ⇾ New Window in the menu bar or press a keyboard shortcut to do the same. The window will open in front of you, without losing your current context.</p>

<p id="p164">With Stage Manager in iPadOS, it’s impossible to do this with a single action.</p>
<p id="p165">If you want to create a new window for an app already in your workspace, you have to click ‘Show All Windows’ and hit the ‘+’ button, but the new window gets thrown into its own, separate workspace – which also becomes the active one, so you get taken out of your existing workspace. At that point, you have to switch back to the previous workspace, grab that window from the strip, and drag it where you wanted it in the first place.</p>

<p id="p167">This is madness: all these operations just to create a new blank window for an app in the same workspace. To which some of you may reply with: <em>but what about drag and drop?</em></p>
<p id="p168">Oh yes, you <em>could</em> use drag and drop to create a new Safari window in the same workspace: grab the Safari icon from the dock or Spotlight, drop it in the workspace, and there you go – another Safari window just spawned. <em>Except</em> that doesn’t work if Safari already had other windows open elsewhere in iPadOS: in that case, drag and drop will pick up the most recently used window of that group and <strong>move it</strong> to your current workspace. So, drag and drop is not a reliable, consistent way to create a new window for the same app in the same workspace either.</p>
<p id="p169">Even with the current design of the strip and Stage Manager, there could have been ways to avoid this scenario: a setting to always create new windows in the same workspace instead of a separate one (macOS Ventura has it); a system-wide keyboard shortcut to create new windows (macOS has it); forcing drag and drop to always create new windows instead of having a mixed behavior. None of these potential solutions were adopted by Apple in five months.</p>
<p id="p170">As it stands now, creating new empty windows for the same app is too convoluted. Apple should rethink this aspect of Stage Manager on iPad.</p>


<p id="p173"><strong>Stage Manager is obsessed with creating new workspaces.</strong> I mentioned this multiple times in the story, but it bears repeating here: Apple needs to fix this Stage Manager obsession with opening apps in new, separate workspaces rather than adding them to your existing one.</p>
<p id="p174">This is a problem that is shared with Stage Manager on macOS Ventura too: every time you launch an app from Spotlight, or the dock, or follow a link to an app – whatever method you use to open an app, Stage Manager defaults to opening it in a standalone workspace. As a result, you’re forced to do the dance of switching back and forth between workspaces to re-add an app from the strip, which is a slow, tedious operation that gets old after a few days of working with Stage Manager on iPadOS.</p>
<p id="p175">As I mentioned above, there should either be a setting to alter the ‘app open’ behavior in Stage Manager or a keyboard modifier (Shift-clicking app icons), or, ideally, both.</p>
<p id="p176"><strong>There’s no way to quickly preview all the windows in a workspace.</strong> One of the unsung heroes of classic macOS windowing is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204100" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mission Control</a>: with a single gesture or keyboard shortcut, you can “explode” your windows and get a useful bird’s-eye view of all the open windows on your system. It’s a genuinely good idea that I use dozens of times every day.</p>
<p id="p177">There’s no equivalent for previewing all windows contained in a Stage Manager workspace. So if your windows are overlapping and some of them are hidden and you want to confirm what’s behind the foreground one, the only way is to manually cycle through them all, one by one, with a keyboard shortcut. Or, God forbid, try to resize them all so you can see a portion of each window onscreen. That is, until Stage Manager decides to shuffle your carefully-constructed window layout around for you.</p>
<p id="p178"><strong>You cannot combine windows from the app switcher or strip.</strong> I also mentioned this before: direct manipulation of windows is nowhere to be found in the app switcher or strip when Stage Manager is active. You cannot grab windows and drop them onto other ones to create workspaces from the strip or app switcher, which is a missed opportunity – especially considering that the app switcher supports creating regular Split Views with drag and drop.</p>
<p id="p179"><strong>To use Stage Manager, I have to disable Predictive Text in keyboard settings.</strong> This is perhaps the worst Stage Manager-related bug I’ve encountered to date, and it’s still here in the shipping version of iPadOS 16: if I want to use Stage Manager, I have to disable Predictive Text in Settings ⇾ General ⇾ Keyboard.</p>
<p id="p180">For whatever reason, if QuickType predictions are enabled, my Magic Keyboard often stops typing into text fields of third-party apps, doesn’t trigger keyboard shortcuts, or generates a random collection of layout- and keyboard-related bugs in apps. The only way I was able to write this story on my iPad with Stage Manager was by disabling this setting; I can’t even imagine what the experience will be like for iPad users who don’t know about this and decide to try Stage Manager.</p>




<p id="p185"><strong>Stage Manager’s automatic window placement makes it impossible to use four apps at once in a grid.</strong> The title says it all: due to how Stage Manager is built on top of an invisible grid and how it enforces specific window sizes, you can’t turn a 12.9” iPad Pro into a grid that shows four active apps at once as quadrants. Try as you might, you won’t be able to create such layout – even if you decide to hide the strip and dock.</p>
<p id="p186">The only way to place four windows onscreen without making them overlap is the following:</p>

<p id="p188"><strong>Stage Manager loses your context when you close the last window in a workspace.</strong> In the current version of Stage Manager, when you close the last window in a workspace, you’ll be unceremoniously kicked back to the Home Screen with no further explanation. I find this behavior inelegant and confusing. Given Stage Manager’s love affair with workspaces, perhaps it would have been preferable to remain in an empty workspace with the strip next to it, or switch you back to the most recently used workspace, or show the app switcher. Anything, really, except bouncing you back to the Home Screen with no additional explanation.</p>
<p id="p189"><strong>Windows randomly cover the dock, strip, or both.</strong> I also mentioned this multiple times in the story: Stage Manager <em>very</em> often decides to cover the recent apps strip or dock just…<em>randomly</em>, forcing you to re-adjust the size of a window to bring them back. I’m not kidding when I say I probably have to do this hundreds of times each day.</p>

<p id="p191"><strong>There are layout bugs when you switch your iPad orientation.</strong> When you rotate your iPad from landscape to portrait, windows in Stage Manager will gain a black bar along the bottom edge. The only way to make these black bars go away is to manually resize a window.</p>

<p id="p193">Oh, and when you switch orientations, <a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1583284706052743168" rel="noopener noreferrer">your window layout is reset, too</a>.</p>
<p id="p194"><strong>You cannot cycle through full-screen and floating layout for a window anymore.</strong> One of my favorite aspects of the Stage Manager betas this summer has been removed in the public release of iPadOS 16.1: you can no longer repeatedly press Globe-F to cycle through a window in full-screen or floating mode.</p>
<p id="p195">I loved that keyboard shortcut as a way to temporarily focus on a full-screen window and then return it to floating mode; for whatever reason, this is not possible anymore. It makes sense that the one thing I liked about Stage Manager was removed.</p>
<p id="p196"><strong>A phantom software keyboard appears when sharing items with the share sheet.</strong> When sharing photos, links, text, or documents with the share sheet in Stage Manager while using a hardware keyboard, a part of the software keyboard appears at the bottom of an app’s window:</p>


<p id="p199"><strong>Full-screen apps like Settings do not work well with Stage Manager.</strong> If you come across an app that was never optimized for Split View and Slide Over, like Apple’s own Settings app, prepare to have an…<em>interesting</em> time with it in Stage Manager.</p>
<p id="p200">The best way to describe this is that legacy full-screen apps do not support being resized to different dimensions; the only “size” you can switch Settings to while in landscape mode is, basically, <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1582834153183059968" rel="noopener noreferrer">the app’s portrait mode</a>. Which of course means that you’ll be looking at some very small text and UI elements with apps that are still built this way.</p>

<p id="p202">The Camera app – another legacy full-screen one – has a similar issue, but with even more hilarious consequences:</p>

<p id="p204"><strong>Where is external display support?</strong> What was, arguably, the main reason why many of us  were looking forward to Stage Manager and windowing on iPadOS – native support for external displays – is not launching today alongside iPadOS 16.1.</p>
<p id="p205">As I <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-16-impressions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> in July, external display integration was extremely buggy and based on another set of wrong design assumptions, so I’m glad Apple was able to see the problems with this feature and delay it until later in the year. Still, I can’t help but think that this was a missed opportunity on Apple’s part to present a coherent, unified vision for desktop-like windowing on iPad, which greatly reduces the potential applications for Stage Manager for power users who have long wanted to go beyond a single-screen experience. For now, we’re back to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/#full-screen-apps" rel="noopener noreferrer">pillarboxing</a> on external display mirroring.</p>
<p id="p206"><strong>There are no Shortcuts actions for Stage Manager.</strong> I saved the saddest missing aspect of Stage Manager for last: there is no integration whatsoever with Shortcuts to open, resize, and move windows in Stage Manager.</p>
<p id="p207">Since last year, Apple has offered Shortcuts actions on macOS to find windows, extract properties from them, and resize them. This has allowed <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac power users</a> to create useful automations that deal with moving windows around and quickly assembling their favorite workspaces and layout modes. The ‘Find Windows’ and ‘Resize Window’ actions are completely absent from Shortcuts in iPadOS 16.1, which continues to have no knowledge of multiple windows for the same app.</p>
<p id="p208">This is another missed opportunity on Apple’s part; I hope it’s something that gets rectified soon in the iPadOS 16 cycle.</p>
<h2 id="a-shaky-foundation-meets-a-rushed-launch">A Shaky Foundation Meets a Rushed Launch</h2>
<p id="p209">At the end of all this, here’s how I feel about Stage Manager: Apple started from <strong>a good idea</strong> – make the iPad more useful by using more apps at once – and botched the execution in iPadOS 16.1 with an over-designed, poorly tested, muddled constellation of missing features, bugs, and confusing interactions.</p>
<p id="p210">The first version of Stage Manager fails to make iPad multitasking more intuitive for newcomers and more flexible for power users. Today, I struggle to understand what kind of market Stage Manager is supposed to serve.</p>
<p id="p211">There’s the <em>seed</em> of a valid idea behind Stage Manager: create a continuum between the Mac and iPad that allows power users to go beyond what iPadOS has offered thus far. But that idea has been paired with the worst technical implementation of multitasking I’ve seen from Apple in the several years I’ve been <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ipad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">using and writing about the iPad</a>.</p>
<p id="p213">Windowing on iPadOS <em>can</em> work and be useful; Stage Manager fails to make it so. The underlying idea <em>is</em> sound; the delivery system, in its current form, is not.</p>
<hr id="hr214"/><p id="p215">It’s been five months since we first saw Stage Manager on iPadOS, and instead of having answers, I’m left with more questions. What happened to the team that created <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/#slide-over" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slide Over</a>, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/#the-new-pointer" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointer</a> support, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/4/#context-menus" rel="noopener noreferrer">context menus</a>, and which tastefully adapted longstanding macOS conventions to a modern, hybrid platform? Has anyone at Apple tried working with Stage Manager on their iPad Pro for longer than 30 minutes? Are they genuinely happy with it? Is there an iPad equivalent of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Workflow team at Apple</a>? How will new iPad users who enable Stage Manager and have no idea of its intricacies <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cVKTHAshk" rel="noopener noreferrer">react to its obscure design and limitations</a>? And:</p>
<p id="p216">Why do I get the sense that Stage Manager was designed in a vacuum to “look good” on macOS<sup id="fnref-70767-5"><a href="#fn-70767-5" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a></sup> and later ported, without much thought, to iPadOS?</p>
<p id="p217">Like I said before, there have been moments in my tests with Stage Manager when I felt like it could be something that would make me more productive. But that’s because, after five months of iPadOS 16, I’ve realized that <strong>I like windowing more than I like Stage Manager</strong>. Stage Manager doesn’t make it easy to be a feature that iPad users can rely on – let alone “love”. At least not in this buggy, unfinished version.</p>
<p id="p218">As it stands now, I don’t know if I’ll keep Stage Manager enabled on my iPad Pro because I’m not sure it’s worth the aggravation. This feature does not meet the high bar Apple set with its previous iPadOS functionalities. I do encourage MacStories readers and iPad users to try Stage Manager; at the moment, however, my recommendation is to not use it for production work or other critical tasks on your iPad.</p>
<hr id="hr219"/><p id="p220">The single question that is looming over Stage Manager is this: can it be salvaged in its current form?</p>
<p id="p221">I think so, but not unless Apple is willing to understand the problem. The company needs to take a long, hard look at Stage Manager’s shortcomings and start acting on a long list of fundamental design problems <em>right away</em>. There are several places <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1583463830004588544" rel="noopener noreferrer">where Apple could start</a>, and there’s a lot of work to do. Still, there is potential for iPadOS to be a platform where you can use windows or Split View or full-screen apps, where you can seamlessly move between keyboard and touch input, and where you can have an experience that is consistent with macOS, but vastly more portable. I just don’t think Stage Manager, in this version debuting in iPadOS 16.1, is the right vessel to carry that vision forward.</p>
<p id="p222">That, ultimately, is my biggest gripe with Stage Manager: it lacks a cohesive, grand vision behind it that was instead there in previous versions of iPadOS. Stage Manager makes iPadOS feel disjointed and broken, an erratic OS confusingly looking for an identity that used to be within reach.</p>
<p id="p224">In the short term, Apple will probably justify the issues of Stage Manager by saying that it’s a specific mode for a small subset of users, that it’s disabled by default, and that they’re working on it. All those things are true. But I also have the feeling that Apple underestimated how <em>hungry</em> iPad users were for a new take on multitasking on their $1200 portable computers that would finally take advantage of the iPad’s powerful hardware.</p>
<p id="p225">(Plus, a shipped feature, even if disabled by default, is still your feature: you should be proud enough of it to <a href="https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Signing_Party.txt&amp;sortOrder=Sort+by+Date&amp;topic=Management" rel="noopener noreferrer">put your name on it</a>.)</p>
<p id="p226">My hope is that Apple will be open to this feedback, iterate on Stage Manager in the iPadOS 16 cycle, and go back to the drawing board for real iPadOS windowing and a developer API next year. There’s a long list of fixes and design tweaks that should be implemented in the meantime; but if the future of iPadOS involves the coexistence of full-screen apps and windowed apps, it’s the foundation itself that has to be rebuilt. I can’t stress this enough: like on macOS, developers need to have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/windows_panels_and_screens" rel="noopener noreferrer">a proper framework</a> to optimize their iPad apps for windowing. As I’ve explained in the story, this would benefit Apple’s own apps, too.</p>
<p id="p227">Right now, Stage Manager is just another mode that was tacked onto existing iPad apps, disabled by default, slimmed down in scope, and shipped with a plethora of bugs. It’s disheartening to see Apple fumble this opportunity so badly, and one has to wonder why it was even <em>necessary</em> to keep pushing for Stage Manager in 2022, but that’s a story for another time.</p>
<p id="p228">I still strongly believe in the iPad as a platform that needs to exist in my life. Despite the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/rediscovering-the-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">incredible renassaince</a> the Mac is living at the moment, the iPad continues to be the <strong>only</strong> device that gives me that unique sense of power and computing freedom when I can sit down with a keyboard on my lap, grab the screen and use it as a tablet, or place it on my desk. That magic never went away.</p>
<p id="p229">Stage Manager was a chance to propel the iPad’s vision forward and onto its logical conclusion: desktop-class windowing. But in iPadOS 16.1, Stage Manager’s “windowing” is far from desktop-class. Apple shouldn’t lose track of its North Star for iPadOS and the iPad’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">modularity</a>, but this?</p>
<p id="p230">This isn’t it.</p>

<p><em>EPISODE TRANSCRIPT</em></p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS: </strong> She changes the way they see the stars themselves. </p>

<p><strong>KATIE HAFNER:</strong> Cecilia Payne figured out what stars are made of. </p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS:</strong> It would be as if you said, “The earth really is round, not square.” It’s that kind of shift in people’s thinking.  </p>

<p><strong>KATIE HAFNER:</strong> I&#39;m Katie Hafner and this is Lost Women of Science Shorts. </p>

<p>Cecilia Payne was 25 years old in 1925, and she just recently joined the Harvard Observatory. So perhaps not surprisingly, her findings were initially suspect. She was later proven right. </p>

<p>The key that helped her to unlock the mystery? The observatory&#39;s glass plate collection. Her fresh eyes allowed her to see on those plates what others had missed. </p>

<p>The Harvard Observatory had started collecting glass plates back before Cecilia&#39;s time. Until the advent of modern computers they were, for a hundred years, considered state-of-the-art. But analyzing the plates was labor intensive and that essential, but tedious work fell to women. What first started as astronomers&#39; wives, daughters, even a housemaid grew into a group of stellar women. Women like Williamina Fleming, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, and Annie Jump Cannon, each of whom more than deserves an episode in her own right.</p>

<p>For now though, let&#39;s zoom in on Cecilia Payne, who brought a fresh perspective to the glass plates. Her observations upended scientific thought. </p>

<p>Producer Lucy Evans takes us to Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>Less than a mile from bustling Harvard Square on a hilltop sits the Harvard Observatory, founded in 1839 in what was once rural countryside, the better for astronomers to chart the night sky.</p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS: </strong>In Cecilia&#39;s time, this hill was spotted with different domes that had telescopes and instruments in them. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of that stuff fell into disrepair. It was wooden buildings, so now it is a parking lot. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> That&#39;s Thom Burns, curator of the Astronomical Glass Plate Collection that&#39;s housed here, along with The Great Refractor, a telescope at the Harvard Observatory.</p>

<p>By the time Cecilia Payne arrived at the observatory in the fall of 1923, the collection of glass plates had grown astronomically, and she saw in them unlocked potential. But let&#39;s go back to their inception. Because there would be no glass plates without the observatory&#39;s telescopes. </p>

<p>Burns pushes through the heavy metal door, and it takes a moment for our eyes to adjust to the cavernous room, multiple stories tall<strong>. </strong></p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS:</strong> So this is a great refractor. The thing that started this observatory.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS</strong>: Installed in 1847, the great refractor with its fifteen-inch lens was, for twenty years, the largest telescope in the U.S. It&#39;s still pretty imposing, sleek, and pointed to the sky. </p>

<p>We can only imagine what it was like back in the mid-1800s to be in this echoey room viewing objects in the night sky that no man had ever seen before.</p>

<p>And it’s no accident, we&#39;re using the word “man” since, for 50 years, access to the great refractor was limited strictly to men. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> So even at Harvard where women were regularly working in the observatory in the daytime, they didn&#39;t really start doing nighttime observing until the mid-1890s. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>That&#39;s author Dava Sobel, whose book &#34;The Glass Universe&#34; tells the story of the women who worked at the Harvard Observatory.</p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> Astronomy is a nighttime occupation, and there was something unseemly about having women involved in nighttime observations. Men and women together in the dark doing science, what a scandal. Doing science, right, right. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Instead, the women were relegated to hunkering down over the glass plates. Collected for more than a century, from 1885 all the way up to 1993, curator Thom Burns says there are over half a million glass plates in the collection. In all, they weigh about 165 tons, and they&#39;re not small. Most are eight by 10 inches, the largest 14 by 17. </p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS: </strong>Huge window pane size pieces of glass that hold thousands, if not millions of points of light that represent stars and the rest of our galaxy.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> And the collection holds more than just photographic negatives of the stars. Some were made with prisms that fan out the starlight, creating what&#39;s known as stellar spectra. These plates are dense with information. Collecting these plates all started back in the mid-1800s when the Harvard Observatory saw the potential of pairing a telescope with a camera to make these glass plates.</p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS:</strong> Photography could allow astronomers to reference back in time. So if you wanted to know what a star looked like 10 years ago, the only way that you can see that is if you had the glass plates of it. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> In 1877, Edward Pickering became Director of the Observatory, and over the next 40 years, he oversaw a huge expansion of the collection.</p>

<p>He had two and sometimes even three telescopes taking pictures throughout the night, which generated a whole lot of plates and a huge amount of data to sift through.</p>

<p>Pickering didn&#39;t have enough staff to do it, but then he had an idea that would carve out a niche for women </p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS:</strong> And he realized that women who are around him, like Williamina Fleming, who happened to be his housemaid, would be able to do that work.</p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> And Pickering was pragmatic. </p>

<p>I think you could get four women for the price of a man.  </p>

<p>So if we can get four pairs of eyes for the price of one pair of eyes, let&#39;s do it. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Pickering&#39;s successor, Harlow Shapley, continued the practice of low wages for women.</p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS:</strong> Shapley would actually record things in gal hours.  </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> And in Shapley&#39;s own autobiography, he speaks of this practice. He invented the term girl hours and said that some jobs even took kilo girl hours. He wrote, “That is how we got things done.”</p>

<p>Still, Pickering and Shapley&#39;s treatment of women was considered better than most. At a time when the notion of women as astronomers was unthinkable at other institutions, Pickering and Shapley&#39;s willingness to include them in their observatory arguably paved the way for women to emerge as stellar scientists.</p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> I am a big booster of Pickering because I think he did so much for women. He nominated them for prizes. He set aside areas of research that they could do, even at home, even if they had families. He sought them out to be contributors to the scientific enterprise. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Still, the day-to-day tasks for most of the women working with the glass plates were repetitive and tedious, like human machines.</p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> Before computers were machines, they were humans who were doing the math involved in interpreting astronomical observations. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> When Cecilia arrived from England on a Pickering research fellowship in 1923, women computers had been hard at work at Harvard for about 40 years. Cecilia, a graduate student on a funded fellowship, was free to go where the science took her and to draw her own conclusions.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, other women had experienced some of this freedom too, but Cecilia also had the guts and determination to stand up and fight for herself, something that was true throughout her life. </p>

<p>Born in 1900, the turn of the 20th century, Cecilia spent her childhood in the quaint village of Wendover in England.</p>

<p>Her father, a lawyer, died when she was four, leaving her mother to raise three children. When Cecilia was 12, they moved to London, and Cecilia was enrolled in a church school. </p>

<p>On the top floor was a room set aside for the little science teaching they had. She wrote later in her autobiography quote, &#34;I used to steal up there by myself, indeed I still do it in dreams, and sit conducting a little worship service of my own adoring the chemical elements&#34;.</p>

<p>She insisted she learn advanced mathematics and German, necessary subjects to become a scientist, but no other girl in her school had ever needed or required those courses. </p>

<p>And she was kicked out of that school at age 17. </p>

<p>But her next school advanced her ambitions, and it was a scholarship that she won in 1919 that allowed her to go off to college, to Newnham, the women&#39;s college at Cambridge University. </p>

<p>There she was studying botany until she attended a lecture by astrophysicist Arthur Stanley Eddington that would change the course of her academic career and her life. Eddington had been able to prove that Einstein was right, that light does indeed bend when it passes near the sun. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s Dava Sobel. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> So when Eddington lectured about this at Cambridge, Cecilia Payne was completely transported. She didn&#39;t sleep for three nights and she wrote down his entire lecture from memory. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Eddington had lit a fire. Afterwards, Cecilia went to see him about a possible future in astronomy. Dava Sobel says Eddington told Cecilia that he saw &#34;no insuperable obstacles,&#34; and Cecilia kept in touch with Eddington after that initial encounter.</p>

<p>So Cecilia starts taking classes in astronomy.  </p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS:</strong> She&#39;s the only woman in these astronomy classes, and the men jeer at her.  </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> That&#39;s author Marissa Moss. She says Cecilia&#39;s early college years were a tough time to be a female student in England.  </p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS:</strong> And this is a time when women can&#39;t get degrees. They can go to classes. At least they can go to the library; the year before she started, they couldn&#39;t even use the library. They had to have a man lend her the books, but she could actually go to the library. She could not check out books, but she could look at them there. So she was too poor to buy books. She was copying textbooks by hand.  </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> So Cecilia would ride her bicycle into the lab chaperoned and in a full-length dress and hat as was expected for a woman to be seen in town.</p>

<p>Later in her autobiography, Cecilia recalled that the lab director, a Nobel Prize winner, opened every lecture by staring directly at her and saying, “Ladies and gentlemen.” </p>

<p>Cecilia wrote later in her autobiography: </p>

<p><strong>CECILIA VOICE-OVER</strong>:  &#34;All the boys regularly greeted this witticism with thunderous applause. And at every lecture I wished I could sink into the earth.&#34;  </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS</strong>: When Cecilia Payne started at Newnham in 1919, the worldwide suffrage movement was in full swing. Just as American women were pressing for the right to vote, the women at Newnham were agitating for change too<strong>. </strong> </p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS:</strong> In 1920, the women students were trying to push the faculty to give them actual degrees, because at this time if a woman graduated, she would get a piece of paper that would say, you have done the coursework and passed the exams. That means you would get a degree from Cambridge if you were a man, but you&#39;re not, so you get this worthless piece of paper instead. And they wanted an actual college degree. This is an undergrad degree, not a graduate degree. They couldn&#39;t get that. They couldn&#39;t even get into graduate school, but you could not even get an undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>And when the women asked for it, the men were so outraged. The male students actually attacked the college. They tried to batter down the women&#39;s college. They tried to put a battering ram into the gates. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>But Cecilia did have one ally. His name was Leslie John Comrie, known as LJ. When Cecilia discovered that her Newnham College had its own observatory, she also found out that it was in need of repair and she needed help.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where LJ came in. He helped Cecilia with the telescope, showed her how to use math to predict celestial movements, and explained computational astronomy. </p>

<p>Back then, Cecilia was in her early twenties, and it was her friend LJ, who introduced her to the Harvard astronomer, Harlow Shapley when he came to deliver a lecture in London. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> She spoke to him immediately afterward about how much she wanted to come and work for him in America.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> That&#39;s Dava Sobel again. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> She had guts, she had drive, and for a shy person, really managed to tap the right people at many points in her career. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> It turns out there was a fellowship at Harvard, a one-year graduate research fellowship earmarked for a woman, but travel and living expenses? She was on her own.</p>

<p>She got some money from her college and entered into an obscure essay contest, writing about the Greek text of one of the gospels. It was something she knew nothing about. But her gamble that few people would enter paid off. No one else submitted and she won 50 pounds, which was enough, she said in her autobiography, for outfitting herself for her journey to the new world.</p>

<p>At the time, astronomy had been going through a change from mapping the heavens to actually understanding what was going on in the stars themselves. </p>

<p>It was the shift from astronomy to astrophysics. </p>

<p>A few years prior, Indian astronomer Meghnad Saha, had developed an equation linking a star&#39;s temperature and pressure to its spectrum. But since he didn&#39;t have the raw data to test it, it was so far just theory. </p>

<p>Cecilia had just learned atomic physics and had at her fingertips a vast collection of stellar spectra at the Harvard Observatory. She recognized the extraordinary potential in these glass plates and was determined to crack the code of the spectra.</p>

<p>By all accounts, she threw herself into her work. Thom Burns is well versed on her duties. He takes out one glass plate in particular and points to century-old handwriting on it. </p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS: </strong>The handwriting comes from different people at different times. You would actually write different notes as you discovered something on the plates.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> So it&#39;s a collaboration of sorts, he says. Women who never met talking to each other across the decades. </p>

<p>He leans in for a closer look and, almost reverentially, points to a scribble. </p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS: </strong>And that&#39;s Cecilia&#39;s hand. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Thom Burns then walks us through her daily routine. Cecilia would select spectral plates to look at and take them to her office, but not by hand. These things were heavy. Thom Burns demonstrates one of the well-preserved carts designed to hold up to a hundred of the plates. </p>

<p>It&#39;s angled at one end so the plates don&#39;t go crashing to the floor.</p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS:</strong> And you can wheel this around. You would have one on every four floors, and then you can take your stack of plates to the plates stack elevator. It&#39;s a dumbwaiter that was designed to carry these heavy glass plates. And then she would follow the plates up the stairs.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> And then Cecilia would get to work poring over the plates with a magnifying glass and see, well, at first she didn&#39;t quite know what she was seeing. The spectra just looked like what she called &#34;tiny parallel smears&#34;, and she couldn&#39;t make sense of them. But then one day, something clicked. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> It turned out that they were showing that the stars were different temperatures.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Cecilia then assigned a temperature range to each type of star that had been defined. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> And then she went further and she analyzed the actual elements in the stars. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> And that, says Dava Sobel, brought about one of Cecilia Payne&#39;s most shocking discoveries. At just 24 years old, what she figured out would change the understanding of the very nature of what the stars are made of. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll be right back.</p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> It&#39;s almost the way a picture suddenly reverses. So the things you thought were craters are actually hills. It&#39;s a complete about-face. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Back in 1924, doctoral student Cecilia Payne, just 24 years old and working at the Harvard Observatory, made a discovery that challenged the fundamental scientific understanding of what the stars are made of.</p>

<p>She turned astronomy on its head. Here&#39;s science writer Dava Sobel. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> Everything people were seeing in the stars were elements that were familiar on the earth. There was aluminum, there was iron, various things that seemed commonplace. And the thought was that the abundances would be similar to earthly abundances.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>In other words, the belief at the time was that the stars were made of the same stuff as earth in the same proportions. But the more Cecilia studied the glass plates, the more she wondered whether the current thinking was in fact wrong, because the hydrogen lines were far more pronounced than expected.</p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> And that&#39;s where she had her giant aha moment because hydrogen was about a million times more prevalent than anything else. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> And the second most abundant is helium. So these two lightest of elements were suddenly the major components of the universe. </p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS:</strong> Nobody can believe it, it just doesn&#39;t compute. They can&#39;t grasp that this could possibly be.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> That&#39;s Cecilia Payne biographer, Marissa Moss. </p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS:</strong> Eddington, who was her mentor and who she respected so much, when she sent him the paper, he said, &#34;Oh, you mean hydrogen and helium on the surface?&#34; And she says, &#34;No, no, I mean the entire star. Inside. They’re entirely hydrogen and helium.&#34; Nobody could quite conceive of that.</p>

<p>She changes the way they see the stars themselves. It really shifted. It would be as if you said, &#34;The earth really is round, not square, not a table.&#34; It&#39;s that kind of shift in people&#39;s thinking. I mean, it just reshifts the way you look at the universe. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> But not everyone was on board with this shift.</p>

<p>Cecilia Payne&#39;s earth-shattering discovery utterly undermined the status quo. Her boss, Harlow Shapley, sent her findings to the expert in stellar composition at the time, Princeton&#39;s Henry Norris Russell, who told her that her results must be wrong. </p>

<p>Cecilia knew Henry Norris Russell&#39;s word could make or break a young scientist.</p>

<p>So, She made a decision she would later come to regret. She acquiesced and wrote in her thesis that her results were, &#34;almost certainly not real.&#34; But she left her data intact, perhaps hoping it would speak for itself. </p>

<p>And it did finally earn Cecilia Payne her Ph.D. Although it was conferred by Harvard&#39;s female equivalent, Radcliffe College, since Harvard was all male at the time.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until a few years after Cecilia&#39;s Ph.D. that other research came out and Henry Norris Russell was able to draw the same conclusions utilizing a different process, and he was the one who authored the paper that was generally accepted by the rest of the predominantly male astronomers as the dogma moving forward.</p>

<p>Henry Norris Russell did briefly acknowledge Cecilia Payne&#39;s discovery, but didn&#39;t mention how he had disputed it initially. And it was Henry Norris Russell who widely got the credit, not Cecilia Payne. </p>

<p>Cecilia wrote later in her autobiography:</p>

<p><strong>CECILIA VOICE-OVER:</strong>  &#34;I was to blame for not having pressed my point. I had given into authority when I believed I was right. I note it here as a warning to the young, if you are sure of your facts, you should defend your position.&#34;</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>After earning her Ph.D. in 1925, her fellowship funds stopped, so she needed a job and was hired back at Harvard by Shapley under the title of Technical Assistant. And this is where Cecilia learns the first lesson of the difference between a fellowship and a job that she&#39;d now be paid at the end of the month, not the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> She had to pawn her jewelry and her violin to get through her first month as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Cecilia wrote in her autobiography: </p>

<p><strong>CECILIA VOICE-OVER: </strong>&#34;I was paid so little. I was ashamed to admit it to my relations in England, but I had the run of the Harvard plates. I could use the Harvard telescopes, and I had the library at my fingertips.”</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>But once her freedom was no longer protected by the fellowship, Shapley could dictate her daily tasks. Rather than let her continue with the spectra, he instead directed her to the field of standard photometry. Still, she was devoted to her work and to Shapley. It was a dedication shared by his staff. </p>

<p>They called him “DD”, for Dear Director. </p>

<p><strong>THOM BURNS: </strong>Dear Director. Yeah. He created a system of loyalty that went directly to him. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>And though Cecilia taught many astronomy lectures, she wasn&#39;t listed in the course catalog. </p>

<p>Shapley did try to get her promoted, but pushback came from the highest office at Harvard. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> Harvard president Abbott Lowell, really didn&#39;t want to see women on the faculty during his lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Cecilia Payne had again hit a glass ceiling. Still, she remained at the Harvard Observatory until, at around age 33, tragedy struck. The untimely deaths of two dear friends in the span of a year, both in boating accidents, left Cecilia bereft. </p>

<p>She took herself to Europe to take stock, visiting observatories and attending conferences perhaps to get her mind off things.</p>

<p>She traveled to Russia and then to Germany where, in 1933, she met astronomer Sergei Gaposchkin, age 35, with a Ph.D. in astronomy. He found himself as a Russian working in Germany, just as Hitler was taking power. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> He had lost his job. He was suspected of being a Russian spy in Germany, but he couldn&#39;t go back to Russia because there he was considered a German spy.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Cecilia turned to her boss, Harlow Shapley, who helped get a visa for Sergei, and gave him a job at the Harvard Observatory working directly with Cecilia. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> So they were together all the time and they fell in love and eloped. After just a few months they went off to New York and got married.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Their colleagues were disapproving, in part because she was taller than he was, but they formed quite the pair and worked closely at the Harvard Observatory, dividing up the universe between them. </p>

<p>Much of their work was on variable stars. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> So a variable star is one that changes its brightness over time in a regular cycle.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> Cecilia studied a whole range of variable stars. Stars like cepheids, which pulsate, getting bigger and smaller, brighter and dimmer. </p>

<p><strong>DAVA SOBEL:</strong> Her husband, Sergei Gaposchkin. He liked stars that changed their brightness because they were in some kind of relationship with other stars. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> That&#39;s when two stars revolve around each other.</p>

<p>Periodically, one star will eclipse the other, and that&#39;s what makes their apparent brightness change. Could be a metaphor of sorts. </p>

<p>The couple worked on parallel tracks, but with a clear common interest in all things celestial while their children ran through the maze that was the observatory complex, playing childhood games like hide-and-seek down in the well, holding the base of the giant refractor. </p>

<p>Cecilia later wrote in her autobiography: </p>

<p><strong>CECILIA VOICE-OVER:</strong> &#34;I had once pictured myself as a rebel against the feminine role. But in this, I was wrong. My rebellion was against being thought, and treated, as inferior&#34;.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> She wrote that she never saw herself as a female astronomer. Of the title scientist or scholar she noted, “Neither of these words has a gender.” </p>

<p>Harvard&#39;s President Abbott Lowell, made good on his promise to keep women off the Harvard faculty while he was alive. And it wasn&#39;t until two presidents later and the departure of Shapley that, in 1956, Cecilia was finally made a full professor, the first woman to be elevated to that position from within the university.</p>

<p>The promotion came with her first sizable pay increase, and a few months later, Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin became the first woman to chair a department at Harvard. She was 56 years old and kept the position for four years until 1960. </p>

<p>By then, Cecilia had written or co-written nine books and 351 papers, and had made literally millions of observations of stars. </p>

<p>But she is best known for that PhD dissertation she wrote back when she was in her early twenties, cracking the code of what the stars are made of.</p>

<p>Four decades later, it still held up. In 1962, the astronomer, Otto Struve pronounced Cecilia&#39;s PhD doctoral dissertation, &#34;The most brilliant thesis ever written in astronomy&#34;. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s biographer Marissa Moss. </p>

<p><strong>MARISSA MOSS:</strong> Later in her life, this is how people summed up what she did. <em>Physics Today</em> said this about her, &#34;She may have felt that she walked with giants. Now we recognize that she herself was one.&#34; And another journal, this is <em>The American Physical Society News</em> said of her, &#34;The giants, Copernicus, Newton, and Einstein. Each in his turn, brought a new view of the universe. Payne&#39;s discovery of the cosmic abundance of the elements did no less&#34;.</p>

<p>So there she is. She&#39;s among the giants. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> In 1976, three years before her death, she became the first woman awarded the Henry Norris Russell Prize. It’s named for the man who, decades earlier, had initially doubted her discovery. Near the end of her autobiography, Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin offers up this advice to young women:</p>

<p><strong>CECILIA VOICE-OVER:</strong> &#34;Do not undertake a scientific career in quest of fame or money. There are easier and better ways to reach them. Undertake it only if nothing else will satisfy you for nothing else is probably what you will receive. Your reward will be the widening of the horizon as you climb, and if you achieve that reward, you will ask no other”.</p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS: </strong>That was a dramatization of Cecilia as read from her autobiography. <em>Lost Woman of Science</em> recently got hold of a digitally mastered recording of Cecilia herself being interviewed towards the end of her life. The audio quality is subpar, but here she is, a rare recording of Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin&#39;s actual voice, recalling the painstaking work done by the women at the Harvard Observatory. <strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>CECILIA PAYNE GAPOSCHKIN:</strong> The stars had to be identified, they had to be marked on plates. There was a whole team of women who were working on it. And then the copy had to be written out. It was all written out by hand. I was there when they were still finishing it. </p>

<p><strong>LUCY EVANS:</strong> That was the voice of groundbreaking astronomer, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, best known for discovering, in her twenties, what the stars are made of. She died in 1979 at the age of 79. </p>

      <p><span><strong>5.12 is a big grade for most climbers</strong>. It’s an aspirational level of performance for many reasons: some of the best lines in the world start kicking in at this grade, and many climbers will say it’s almost impossible to progress beyond it without consistent training. Even outside of the USA, the rough European grade equivalent of 7a and UK trad level of E5 are seen as rites of passage in any serious climber’s journey. </span></p>
<p><span>At <a href="https://latticetraining.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lattice</a>, we’ve spent the last decade studying the data, habits, and approaches of climbers at all levels. And we’ve found that while 5.12 is in some ways no different than any other grade,  5.12 climbers often share certain strengths and skills that most climbers aspiring to the grade will need to develop. In this article, we’re going to show you where you’re best focusing your time and what training habits are the biggest bang for their buck. </span></p>
<ul>

</ul>


      
      <p><span id="section_1">Section divider</span></p><h2><b>Strength for 5.12</b></h2>
<p><b><i>Train beyond the boulder grade</i></b><i><span>. </span></i><span>For every grade there is a rough baseline of strength that you’ll need to pull the hardest moves when you’re fatigued. Many 5.12a’s and 5.12b’s have cruxes that are no harder than V2 or V3, which feel easy when you’re working sections but hard when you’re tired. Many 5.11 climbers fall short because they don’t train strength </span><i><span>beyond</span></i><span> the difficulty of the hardest moves of their 5.12 projects. If you’re looking to dominate at 5.12 then move your baseline to V5 or V6.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_93820"><a href="https://www.climbing.com/subscribe-to-newsletters-from-climbing/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.climbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-10-05-at-1.25.38-PM-2.jpg" alt="" width="582" height="588"/></a></figure>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Your max boulder grade should be at least two to three grades above the crux moves of your project</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Boulder with specificity in mind.</i></b><span> These days almost everyone understands the benefits of bouldering in the gym for strength improvements. However, it’s common for climbers to ignore the specificity element of bouldering strength training, and the reality is that not all ‘boulder strength’ is equal. If your project is on a 20-degree overhanging wall with half-pad crimps all the way, then training on juggy roofs is not going to be as useful as you hope—even if you do gain strength in that style. Match your training to your project(s) and you’ll see rewards. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Your bouldering strength is terrain and hold specific. Make sure that your bouldering ability at your chosen grade matches the style of your project for the best transfer. </span></li>
</ul>

      <p><span id="section_2">Section divider</span></p><h2><b>Power endurance for 5.12   </b></h2>
<p><b><i>Match your project duration</i></b><span>. Most climbers start completing some form of power endurance training as they progress through the 5.11s, even if it’s in the unstructured form of having a few attempts on their current gym project. Unfortunately though, gym climbs are often much shorter than outside projects, and consequently the ‘time on task’ doesn’t represent the demands of the goal. 5.12 power endurance will become a reality surprisingly fast if you measure the time that it takes you to climb your project outside and then they train at that exact duration on your gym laps. In many cases this might mean doing two or three continuous laps on a route. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If your project takes 16 minutes to climb, then your power endurance training will be more effective when the exercise sets (at the right intensity) also match this time. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Train with pace In mind</i></b><span>. One of the most common mistakes that we see intermediate climbers make with their power endurance training is climbing at a pace that does not represent what they do on their project. We’ve watched countless climbers over the years blaze through amazing looking power endurance training cycles only to fail on their outdoor projects, where their pace of climbing is two to three times  slower (sometimes more!). If you’re looking to hit 5.12, then video yourself on your project and find out how long it takes on average to complete each move or section. You might just be surprised how long you pause to shake or lock off or move your feet into efficient positions. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Time how long each move takes on average for your project. Once you know this, make sure that your training matches that level of pacing. </span></li>
</ul>

      <p><span id="section_3">Section divider</span></p><h2><b>Endurance for 5.12</b></h2>
<p><b><i>Build a bigger base</i></b><b>.</b><span> One of the fastest ways to develop the endurance capacity for 5.12 is to do a lot more mileage than you think. Most climbers can get through 5.10 and 5.11 by simply trying hard lines, putting the time in, and seeing it through. This means that there’s a good chance you’re not doing multiple laps on climbs, either inside or outside. A 5.12 climber who climbs at the gym twice a week should be looking at somewhere between 200-400m (650-1,300 feet) of endurance mileage; that means if your gym’s walls are 50 feet tall, you’re doing 12-25 pitches. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Your endurance base is directly correlated to the amount of mileage that you put in. Treat this part of your climbing a bit like a runner or a swimmer, with all ‘miles in the bank’ counting towards your progress.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Go easier than you think.</i></b> <span>The drive to hit that golden grade of 5.12 can be an alluring one, and as a result many climbers push too much of their endurance work into that ‘just in control and very pumped’ category. Contrary to popular belief, endurance can be built through extremely easy, high-volume climbing well below your endurance threshold. For most, this will involve climbing at six to eight  grades below your onsight/flash limit. You should be able to talk comfortably all the way through your reps and sets and should not feel notably pumped—much like going for a slow jog.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Base endurance training should be performed  at a much easier intensity than most climbers think. You do not want any form of pumped forearms!</span></li>
</ul>

      <p><span id="section_4">Section divider</span></p><h2><b>Common mistakes to avoid</b></h2>
<p><span>Once you’ve got your training basics above sorted—and this is by no means an exhaustive list—you should also pay careful attention to the list of mistakes that we commonly see climbers make when planning their training. Many of those stuck at 5.11 would have a high chance of instantly (let’s say within two months) progressing a full number grade if they got these things right. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Never taking a deload week</i></b><b>. </b><span>One of the first things we do with a training program is schedule consistent weeks of ‘relative rest’ roughly once per month. What we mean by </span><i><span>relative</span></i><span> is that the loading (volume, intensity and frequency) of the plan in a deload week should be around 50% or less. Most climbers hate resting properly, but they wouldn’t if they realized what a huge difference it makes! </span></p>
<p><b><i>Doing endurance training at the end of a training cycle</i></b><b>.</b><span> This is generally the wrong way round! We do appreciate that climbers often fail on their project, panic, think “Oh no I’m not fit enough!” and then cram in some endurance work at the end. Unfortunately this is almost complete self-sabotage, since basic, high-volume endurance work results in reductions in high intensity power endurance output and also tends to decrecruit the fingers. The result: you end up feeling weaker. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Not giving enough time to refine power endurance</i></b><b>.</b><span> If you’ve prepared well and done your base endurance capacity work, then you should realistically give yourself at least 8 weeks to train peak power endurance output. Sure, you may feel significantly better—and able to make progress on your project—after just 4 weeks, but there’s a very good chance you’ve got more in the tank. Be patient and keep pushing. </span></p>
