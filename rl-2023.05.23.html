Having healthy logging practices, and doing capacity planning ahead of time, all count as this. Before declaring a system is production-ready, ensuring monitoring and alerting are in place, and doing a load test – for large systems, at least – are prudent actions to take.</p><p><strong>Capacity planning</strong><span> is a topic that’s important for large systems. It’s crucial to understand expected load in terms of QPS (queries-per-second,) and resource utilization in terms of CPU and memory and read and write loads, when choosing technologies and before going live with them. There are companies at which infra teams provide resources to automatically scale workloads, and there are others where teams must allocate virtual machines ahead of time.</span></p><p><span>The author of the article makes the case that queue size, throughput and latency are all connected; so changing any one of them means a change elsewhere. </span><strong>Rate limiting</strong><span> and </span><strong>load shedding </strong><span>are approaches worth taking into account when dealing with additional traffic.</span></p><p><span>Some of the learnings are especially relevant for payments systems. </span><strong>Idempotency keys </strong><span>are needed to implement </span><a href="https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-idempotency" rel="">idempotent APIs</a><span> – ones where double charges don’t happen, even when requests are retried. Latencies and timeouts are especially relevant for real time payments systems. When systems are down, it can be better to not retry at all, and to use a </span><strong>circuit breaker</strong><span> to avoid cascading failures. Shopify built a Ruby circuit breaker called </span><a href="https://github.com/Shopify/semian" rel="">Semian</a><span>, to protect its HTTP, MySQL and gRPC services.</span></p><p><span>The article touches on practices which are helpful when operating any production systems, such as having good incident management practices, or running regular incident retrospectives. </span><em><span>Previously in the newsletter, we covered </span><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/healthy-oncall-practices" rel="">Healthy oncall practices</a><span> and </span><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/incident-review-best-practices" rel="">Incident review and postmortem best practices</a><span>.</span></em></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://shopify.engineering/building-resilient-payment-systems?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pragmaticengineer&amp;utm_content=newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Read the full article&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://shopify.engineering/building-resilient-payment-systems?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pragmaticengineer&amp;utm_content=newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com" rel=""><span>Read the full article</span></a></p><p>Payments systems are close to my heart, having worked on them at Uber for four years. I found myself nodding along with many of the learnings Bart has summarized.</p><p><span>The importance of idempotency for most payment systems is one I emphasize. A topic not covered in the list which I had many challenges with, is deciding when to fail open or to fail close with a payments system, and how to interpret unknown payments statuses. While at Uber, incorrect mapping of a payment provider’s message allowed for free UberEats orders for two days in 2019, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVzcWBmN2L0" rel="">as I summarize in this video</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>How did Grab design its distributed system which processes incoming food orders, at a scale of millions of orders per day? Engineering manager </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xi-chen-4a50b6101" rel="">Xi Chen</a><span> and backend engineer </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cao-siliang-ab977448" rel="">Silang Cao</a><span> wrote </span><a href="https://engineering.grab.com/how-we-store-millions-orders?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pragmaticengineer&amp;utm_content=newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="">an in-depth article</a><span> about this process. First, the team started by taking a step back, looking at the problem space and mapping out query and traffic patterns.</span></p><p><strong>Query patterns. </strong><span>The team at Grab analyzed the type of </span><strong>read queries</strong><span> and </span><strong>write queries </strong><span>the platform supports. Queries could be split into </span><strong>transactional queries</strong><span> and </span><strong>analytical queries</strong><span>.</span></p><p>The differences between read/write and transactional/analytical queries are important because the ratio of read/write queries influences which data-level technology to use. Some technologies have better performance characteristics for read-intensive use cases, while others thrive with write-intensive use cases.</p><p>The transactional/analytical query split is important because transactional queries need to be as performant as possible. For analytical queries, performance may be a less important concern, so those queries don’t need to be executed in real time.</p><p><strong>Traffic patterns</strong><span>. Food delivery applications have traffic patterns where peak hours often result in several times the load being placed on systems. This is most easily detected by looking at the QPS load. For example, this is my sketch of how a food delivery service’s order endpoints may receive data, with two distinct peaks at lunchtime and dinner time:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66307179-5d5c-4e52-bfbe-4cee939e8642_1300x656.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66307179-5d5c-4e52-bfbe-4cee939e8642_1300x656.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66307179-5d5c-4e52-bfbe-4cee939e8642_1300x656.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66307179-5d5c-4e52-bfbe-4cee939e8642_1300x656.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66307179-5d5c-4e52-bfbe-4cee939e8642_1300x656.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66307179-5d5c-4e52-bfbe-4cee939e8642_1300x656.png" width="1300" height="656" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66307179-5d5c-4e52-bfbe-4cee939e8642_1300x656.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:656,&#34;width&#34;:1300,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:155780,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;An illustration of a potential traffic pattern of food order endpoints, in a food ordering application.

They settled on stability even in high QPS situations, cost effectiveness and strong consistency for transactional queries.</span></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model" rel="">Strong consistency</a><span> means that in a distributed system, all nodes need to contain the same data at all times. Assuming a large enough system with several nodes, in practice this means trading off higher latency for strong consistency. This is because it takes more time for data changes to propagate to all nodes. Note that Grab didn’t aim to build a system in which all queries have strong consistency. They only placed this constraint for transactional ones – but not for the analytical ones.</span></p><p><strong>Technology choices. </strong><span>Grab chose an </span><strong>OLTP database</strong><span> which is optimized for high write load. The company chose DynamoDB because of characteristics like high availability, scalability, support for strong consistent reads by primary key and </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html" rel="">adaptive capacity</a><span> to handle </span><strong>hotkey traffic</strong><span>. </span></p><p>Hotkey traffic refers to concentrated traffic directed at a hotspot of entries, instead of this traffic being evenly distributed. For databases that use sharding, this could mean overloading the nodes where these hotspots live.</p><p><strong>An OLAP database</strong><span> was chosen to implement analytical queries. OLAP databases are optimized for high read loads. Grab used MySQL RDS for this approach.</span></p><p>The article has more detail on implementation, DynamoDB implementation (using GSI, sparse indexes, DynamoDB TTL), the reasons why Grab did not choose Aurora, how the company implemented data ingestion using Kafka streams, and the challenges of the current setup:</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://engineering.grab.com/how-we-store-millions-orders?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pragmaticengineer&amp;utm_content=newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Read the full article&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://engineering.grab.com/how-we-store-millions-orders?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pragmaticengineer&amp;utm_content=newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com" rel=""><span>Read the full article</span></a></p><p>What I especially like about this article is how it showcases a data-first and principles-first design process.

What’s interesting is they share how rolling out their own platform features usually takes much longer than the timeframe in which product teams commonly roll out changes.</p><p><strong>Platform code cannot depend on product code. </strong><span>The Yelp team phrases this as their SDK, a core dependency which cannot depend on client code inside other repositories.</span></p><p><strong>The experimentation &amp; logging SDK is the first thing to launch in the app. </strong><span>All parts of the app depend on experimentation and logging, so this part of the app is initialized first. The problem is that if this SDK crashes, the app is unrecoverable.</span></p><p>This means the platform team needs to ensure there is a very low – ideally zero – crash rate. They also need to find ways to report their own crashes in a way that does not utilize the logging component they offer other teams for logging errors and crashes.</p><p><strong>Onpoint week </strong><span>refers to a rotation system during which an engineer is responsible for answering questions on the team channel, I’ve confirmed with another engineer at Yelp.

It showcases that platform teams are typically small – only two Android engineers on this team! – and that a lot of the work comes via communication with other teams.</p><p>The team reflected on how many questions they get from other teams, writing that while they have documentation, their system is complex and requires a little bit of understanding. My take is that the documentation might not be as intuitive as the team hoped for, or the API isn’t as easy to use as they thought.</p><p>I was surprised to not read anything about this platform team gathering feedback from customers, then using that feedback to improve their SDK, documentation or processes. Doing this might result in a lower workload for the onpoint engineer. </p><p>It was curious that the article stresses the SDK cannot have other dependencies. I’ve observed that the fact platform code is considered “core,” also gives an excuse to build things from scratch and not have other dependencies. Especially within Big Tech, you’re far more likely to see all platform code implement things like networking, data storage and other things from scratch, over using third-party, open-source libraries. Also, in many cases, platform teams become intellectual playgrounds where reinventing the wheel is not scrutinized, as not doing so means there are no external dependencies.</p><p>The “use open-source” vs “build your own” debate won’t ever go away. My view is you should decide which path to choose based on resources and constraints. I’d urge building things which are core to your business, and don’t reinvent the wheel when there’s no practical reason for it.</p><p><span>Instagram launched Suggested Posts in August 2020. Four months later in December 2020, the company </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2020/12/10/web/how-instagram-suggests-new-content/" rel="">shared a post</a><span> about how it built this feature, which is essentially an </span><strong>information retrieval system (IR)</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Building information retrieval systems has two steps, both of which Instagram followed.</p><p><strong>1. Candidate generation. </strong><span>Based on a user’s implicit or explicit interests, grab all the candidates a user could possibly be interested in. This stage is heavy on </span><strong>recall</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Instagram builds a virtual graph of users’ interests based on their engagement. The nodes in this graph are engagement actions such as a “liked” picture, a video saved, a friend’s post liked or friend’s post saved.</p><p><strong>Seeds</strong><span> in this graph are the nodes the user has shown interest in, the nodes of the engagement actions. Seeds then can be used as input for the </span><strong>K-nearest-neighbor</strong><span> (KNN)</span><strong> </strong><span>pipelines. Instagram builds these KNN pipelines based on two classic machine learning principles:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Embeddings</strong><span> based on similarity. An </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/video-lecture" rel="">embedding</a><span> is a fundamental structure of recommendation systems; it’s a relatively low-dimensional space into which higher dimensional vectors can be translated. Instagram builds embeddings based on user engagement data, to help find thematically and topically relevant accounts.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Co-occurrence</strong><span>-based similarity. A </span><a href="https://livebook.manning.com/concept/machine-learning/co-occurrence" rel="">co-occurrence matrix</a><span> computes the number of times each pair of items appear together in a list. Instagram generates a matrix using user-media interaction data, then calculates co-occurrence frequencies on media pairs.</span></p></li></ul><p>This is what the Suggested Posts candidate generation architecture looks like:</p><p><strong>2. Candidate selection.</strong><span> From all the candidates generated, select the best subset for the user. This stage is typically done by a heavyweight ranking algorithm.</span></p><p>Instagram does the weighting based on both positive engagement factors for each node - such as “like”, comment, save. It does this for negative factors as well, like ‘not interested’ and ‘show fewer posts like this.’ </p><p><em>Now you know what happens when you hit the ‘not interested’ button: you’re adding negative weight to a given node in the candidate selection process!</em></p><p>The weights are tuned in two ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Offline replay</strong><span> over offline user sessions. Offline replay most likely refers to </span><a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/20535/what-is-experience-replay-and-what-are-its-benefits" rel="">experience replay</a><span> in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning" rel="">Q-learning</a><span> algorithms.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Bayesian optimization</strong><span> during online optimization. Bayesian optimization is a frequently used approach in applied machine learning. It is based on the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem" rel="">Bayes theorem</a><span>. Here’s a video explaining </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-NTkxfd7-8" rel="">how Bayesian optimization works</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>For model classes, Instagram uses:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Multi-task multi-label sparse neural nets</strong><span> (MTML).

When I became an engineering manager at Uber, I was enthusiastic about my new role, initially. However, over time I started to feel some parts of the job made it more difficult to progress, than if I would have stayed an IC. The three biggest issues I saw were:</p><ul><li><p>Feeling trapped as a middle manager. Leadership would sometimes give orders from above with no transparency on the “why,” and didn’t respond to questions. This left me in an uncomfortable position where I did not know why I was to do the things asked of me. #6 in this EM Bill of Rights addresses exactly this.</p></li><li><p>Lack of feedback. When you become an EM, you get a lot less feedback. I like how #4 in Emily’s list focuses on ensuring feedback keeps flowing from ICs, as well.</p></li><li><p>Compensation tied to engineering. At Uber, compensation bands for EMs were the same as for ICs. While this was never my biggest concern, I would support making the two independent as suggested in #5, so they can move with the market, in-line with demand for senior ICs and managers.</p></li></ul><p>I revived the Real World Engineering Challenges series after feedback from readers who shared how they enjoyed the articles as a way to keep their tech chops sharp, and to get exposure to engineering and organizational case studies outside of their everyday “work bubble.”</p><p><span>When I started The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter almost a year ago, I committed to one long-form article every Tuesday for subscribers. I’ve since quietly changed this cadence to two longer articles on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Tuesday ones are more educational, and are typically deep dives into a given topic.

Becoming an effective engineering executive is adding more approaches to your toolkit and remaining flexible about which to deploy for any given request.</p><hr/><p><em>You can use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PgfKHx39QpqXrSpccTsupV_ddQ3VvIkkTgAPPofVAuU/edit#">Engineering Metrics Update template</a> to report on these measures.</em></p><h2 id="measuring-for-yourself">Measuring for yourself</h2><p>When you enter a new executive role, your CEO will probably make an offhand remark that you will, “need to prepare an engineering slide for the next board meeting in three weeks.” That’s a very focusing moment–how do I avoid embarrassing myself in my first board meeting!–but even if your first concrete testament to measurement is a board slide, I don’t recommend starting your measurement efforts by instrumenting something that the board will find useful.</p><p>Instead, start by measuring for yourself. What is the information that you need to operate the engineering organization effectively?
As you start to document your measurement goals, I recommend starting with these four distinct buckets:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Measure to plan</strong>: what would help you align with cross-functional stakeholders to decide <em>what</em> to ship in a given quarter, half or year? Critically, this is not about <em>how</em> you ship (“are we using agile?”), rather your goal is to support project selection and prioritization. You want a single place that shows the business, product,
and engineering impacts of work.
You might argue that planning is the product team’s responsibility, but only engineering can represent the full set of projects
that engineering works on (e.g. product’s unlikely to roadmap your database migration).</p><p>Start by tracking the number of shipped projects by team, and the impact of each of those projects</p></li><li><p><strong>Measure to operate:</strong> what do you need to know to be confident that your software and teams are operating effectively on a day-to-day basis?
It can be helpful to think of these as quality measures, because the real question behind them is:
how do you know you should be following your planned roadmap rather than swarming to fix a critical problem?</p><p>Some good places to start are: tracking the number of incidents (each connected to an incident review writeup), minutes of user-facing API and website downtime, latency of user-facing APIs and websites, engineering costs normalized against a core business metric (for example, cost to serve your most important API, calculated simply by dividing API requests per month by engineering spend for that month),
user ratings of your product (e.g. app store ratings), and a broad measure of whether your product’s onboarding loop is completing (e.g. what percentage of users reaching your website
successfully convert into users?)</p></li><li><p><strong>Measure to optimize</strong>: what do you need to know to effectively invest time into improving engineering productivity?
If you look at engineering as a system, how would you understand that system’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html#FeedbackLoops">feedback loops</a>?
It’s worth noting that this tends to be how engineers themselves measure their experience working within your company.</p><p>Start with <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124">SPACE</a> or its predecessor, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM">Accelerate</a>. If those are too heavy, then start with a <a href="https://infraeng.dev/developer-survey/">developer productivity survey</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Measure to inspire and aspire</strong>: how can you concisely communicate engineering’s transformational impact to the business? How would you energize a potential hire, new cross-functional executive, or board member about engineering’s contribution to making the business possible?</p><p>Maintain a list of technical investments that turned something impossible (“we can’t make breaking API changes without causing production impact to our entire user base”) into something so obvious that it isn’t really worth mentioning (“we allow each individual API integration to upgrade API versions at their convenience rather than on our timeline”). When you speak at company meetings, anchor on these kinds of generational improvements, and try to include at least one such improvement into every annual planning cycle</p></li></ol><p>A frequent rejoinder when you discuss measurement is whether you’re measuring enough–shouldn’t we <em>also</em> be measuring database CPU load, pull request cycle time, etc. The secret of good measurement is <em>actually measuring something</em>. The number one measurement risk is <em>measuring nothing because you’re trying to measure everything</em>. You can always measure more, and measuring more is useful, but measure across many small iterations, and don’t be afraid to measure something quick and easy today.</p><h2 id="measuring-for-stakeholders">Measuring for stakeholders</h2><p>One reason to focus on quick measurements rather than perfect measurements is that there are a <em>lot</em> of folks within your company that want you to measure stuff. There’s stuff that you find intrinsically valuable to measure, but there’s also stuff that your CEO wants you to measure, that Finance is asking you for, to present at monthly status meetings, and so on.</p><p>While there are quite a few asks, the good news is that the requests are common across companies, and can usually be mapped into one of these four categories:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Measure for your CEO or your Board.</strong> Many experienced managers, likely including your CEO, <a href="https://lethain.com/inspection/">manage through inspection</a>.
This means they want you to measure something, set a concrete goal against it, and share updates on your progress against that goal.
They don’t have an engineering background to manage your technical decisions,
so instead they’ll treat your ability to execute against these goals as a proxy for the quality of your engineering leadership.
If they dig into your measurements, they’ll focus on engineering’s contribution to the business strategy itself,
rather than the micro-optimizations of how engineering works day-to-day.</p><p>These measures don’t need to be novel, and your best bet is to reuse measurements for your own purposes. Most frequently that is reusing your measures for planning or operations.</p><p>The biggest mistake to avoid is asking your CEO to measure engineering through your <em>Metrics to optimize</em>.
Although intuitively you can agree that being more efficient is likely to make engineering more impactful,
most CEOs are not engineers and often won’t be able to take that intuitively leap.
Further, being highly efficient simply means that engineering <em>could</em> be impactful, not that it actually <em>is</em> impactful!</p></li><li><p><strong>Measure for finance.</strong> Finance teams generally have three major questions for engineering. First, how is actual headcount trending compared to budgeted headcount? Second, how are actual vendor costs trending compared to budgeted vendor costs? Third, which engineering costs can be <a href="https://lethain.com/capitalize-engineering-costs/">capitalized instead of expensed</a>, and how do we justify that in the case of an audit?</p><p>You will generally have to meet finance where they are within their budgeting processes, which vary by company but generally are unified within any given company. The capitalization versus expensing question is more nuanced and deserves detailed discussion; I will say that the default approaches tend to be cumbersome, but there is almost always a reasonable intersection between the priorities of Finance, auditors and engineer that slightly disappoint each party while still meeting all parties’ requirements.</p><p>Although I’ve rarely had finance ask for it, I find it particularly valuable to align with finance on engineering’s investment thesis for
allocating capacity across business priorities and business units. At some point business units within your company will start arguing about how to attribute engineering
costs across different initiatives (because engineering costs are high enough that allocating too many will make their new initiative incur a heavy loss rather than show
promise), and having a clearly documented allocation will make that conversation much more constructive</p></li><li><p><strong>Measure for strategic peer organizations.</strong> Your best peer organizations are proactive partners in maximizing engineering’s business impact. Optimistically, this is because these functions are led by enlightened business visionaries. More practically, it’s because their impact is constrained by engineering’s impact, so by optimizing engineering’s impact, they simultaneously optimize their own. It’s common to find product, design and sales functions who are well-positioned for strategic partnership with engineering.</p><p>You can usually use the same metrics you need for planning to align effectively with strategic peers organizations</p></li><li><p><strong>Measure for tactical peer organizations.</strong> While strategic peer organizations may agree to measure engineering on the impact of its work, more tactical organizations will generally demand to measure engineering based on more concrete outcomes. For example, a Customer Success organization may push engineering to be measured by user ticket acceptance rate and resolution time. Legal may similarly want to measure you on legal ticket resolution time. Tactical organizations are not tactical because they lack the capacity for strategic thinking, but rather because their organization is graded in a purely tactical way. If they align with engineering to maximize engineering’s impact, their organization will be perceived as underachieving.</p><p>Tactical organizations are held accountable to specific, concrete numbers, and likewise want to hold engineering accountable to specific, concrete numbers of their own. Find something that you and the peer organization are able to agree upon, identify a cadence for discussing how effective that measure is at representing the real cross-organizational need, and iterate over time</p></li></ol><p>Measuring for stakeholders is often time consuming, and at times can even feel like a bit of a waste. When done properly, it still is time consuming, but saves time because it consolidates messy, recurring discussions into simpler, more predictable contracts about maintaining specific, measurable outcomes.</p><h2 id="sequencing-your-approach">Sequencing your approach</h2><p>The list of stuff to measure for your own purposes is long enough, once you add on the stakeholder asks, the combined list can be exceptionally long. Indeed, it’s a truth universally acknowledged, that an engineering executive must be in want of more engineers to support measuring their existing list of “must have” metrics.
You’ll never actually measure everything you want. However, over the course of a year or two, you’ll be able to instrument the most important, iterate on them, and build confidence in what they actually mean.</p><p>I tried to create a concrete list of exactly what you should measure first to avoid spreading yourself too thin,
but it wasn’t that useful. There’s just too much context for a rote list.
Instead, I offer three rules for sequencing your measurement asks:</p><ol><li>Some things are difficult to measure, only measure those if you’ll actually incorporate that data into your decision making. If you’re unlikely to change your approach or priorities based on the data, then measure something simple instead, even if it’s <a href="https://lethain.com/metrics-for-the-unmeasurable/">just a proxy metrics</a></li><li>Some things are easy to measure, be willing to measure those to build trust with your stakeholders, even if you don’t find them exceptionally accurate. Most stakeholders will focus more on the intention and effort than the actual output. It’s an affirmation that you’re willing to be accountable for your work, not a testament to the thing being measured</li><li>Whenever possible, only take on one new measurement task at a time. Measurement is surprisingly challenging. Instrumentation can go awry. Data can be subtly wrong. Bringing on many new measures at once takes a lot of time from you or the subset of your organization that has a talent for validating new data, and doing many measures at once is a challenge for most organizations</li></ol><p>Work through measuring something from each category to establish a baseline across these dimensions. Then, rather than being finished, you’ll likely want to start again,
albeit with a bit less priority and focus. Measurement is not a one-time task, but instead an ongoing iteration.
There will always be situational context to your specific situation that may lead you to prioritize a slightly different measurement approach.</p><p>That’s fine! Don’t get caught up in following this plan exactly, take the parts that are most useful.</p><h2 id="anti-patterns">Anti-patterns</h2><p>Measurement is ripe with anti-patterns. The ways you can mess up measurement are truly innumerable,
but there are some that happen so frequently that they’re worth calling out:</p><ul><li><p><em>Focusing on measurement when the bigger issue is a lack of trust.</em>
Sometimes you’ll find yourself in a measurement loop. The CEO asks you to provide engineering metrics,
you provide those metrics. Instead of seeming satisfied, the CEO asks for another, different set of metrics.
Often the underlying issue here is a lack of trust. While metrics can support building trust, they are rarely
enough on their own.</p><p>Instead, push the CEO (or whoever remains frustrated despite bringing more metrics) on their frustration,
until you get to the bottom of the concern masquerading as a need for metrics</p></li><li><p><em>Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.</em> Many measurement projects never make progress because
the best options require data that you don’t have. Instrumenting that data gets onto the roadmap,
but doesn’t quite get prioritized. A year later, you’re not measuring anything.</p><p>Instead, push forward with anything reasonable, even if it’s flawed</p></li><li><p><em>Using optimization metrics to judge performance.</em>
It’s easy to be tempted to use your optimization metrics
to judge individual or team performance. For example, if a team is generating far
fewer pull requests than other teams their size, it’s easy to judge that team as
less productive. That may be true, but it certainly might not.</p><p>Instead, evaluate teams on based on their planning or operational metrics</p></li><li><p><em>Measuring individuals rather than teams.</em>
Writing and operating software is a team activity, and while one engineer
might be focused on writing code this sprint, another might be focused on
<a href="https://noidea.dog/glue">being glue</a> to make it possible for the first engineer to focus.
Looking at individual data can be useful for diagnostic purposes, but it’s
a poor tool for measuring performance.</p><p>Instead, focus on measuring organization and team-level data. If something seems off,
then consider digging into individual data to diagnose, but not to directly evaluate</p></li><li><p><em>Worrying too much about measurements being misused.</em>
Many leaders are concerned that their CEO or Board will misuse data. For example, they might throw a fit
that many engineers are only releasing code twice a week: it’s that a sign that the engineers are lazy?
Recognize that these lines of discussion are very frustrating, but also that avoiding it doesn’t fix them!</p><p>Instead, take the time to educate stakeholders who are interpreting data in unconstructive ways.
Keep an open mind, there is always something to learn, even if a particular interpretation is in error</p></li><li><p><em>Deciding measures alone rather than in community.</em>
I do recommend coming to measurement with a clear point of view on what you’ve seen work well,
but that should absolutely be coupled with multiple rounds of feedback and iteration.
Particularly when you’re new to a company, it’s easy to project your understanding of your last job
onto the new one, which erodes trust.</p><p>Instead, build trust by incorporating feedback from your team and peers</p></li></ul><p>If you’ve avoided these, you’re not guaranteed to be on the right path,
but it’s fairly likely.</p><h2 id="postscript-building-confidence-in-data">Postscript: Building confidence in data</h2><p>After you’ve rolled out your new engineering measures, you may find that they aren’t very useful. This may be because different parties interpret them in different ways (“Why is Finance so upset about database vendor costs increasing when our total costs are still under budget?”). It may even be that the measures conflict with teams’ experiences of working with the systems (“Why does the Scala team keep complaining about build latency when average build latency is going down?”).</p><p>The reality is that measurement is not inherently valuable, it is only by repeatedly pushing on data that you get real value from it. A few suggestions for pushing on data to extract more value from it:</p><ul><li>Review the data on a weekly cadence. Ensure that review looks at how the data has changed over the last month, quarter or year. Whenever possible, also establish a clear goal to compare against, as both setting and missing goals will help focus on the areas where you have the most to learn</li><li>Maintain a hypothesis for why the data changes. If the data changes in a way that violates your hypothesis (“cost per request should go down when requests per second go up, but in this case the cost went up as requests per second went up, why is that?”), then dig in until you can fully explain why you were wrong. Use that new insight to refine both your hypothesis and your tracked metrics</li><li>Avoid spending too much time alone with the data, instead bring others with different points of view to push on the data together. This will bring together many different hypotheses for how the data reacts, and will allow the group to learn together</li><li>Segment data to capture distinct experiences. Reliability and latency in Europe will be invisible–and potentially quite bad–if your datacenters and the vast majority of your users are in the United States. Similarly, Scala, Python and Go will have different underlying test and build strategies; just because build times are decreasing on average doesn’t mean Scala engineers are having a good build experience</li><li>Discuss how the objective measurement does or does not correspond with the subjective experience of whatever the data represents. If builds are getting faster, but don’t feel faster to the engineers triggering them, then dig into that–what are you missing?</li></ul><p>There are, of course, many more ways to push on data, but following these will set you on the right path towards understanding the details and limits of your data. If you don’t spend this sort of time with your data, then it’s easy to be data-driven, highly-informed, and also come to the wrong conclusions. Some of the worst executive errors stem from relying too heavily on subtly flawed data, but it’s avoidable with a bit of effort.</p><p><time datetime="2023-01-02T06:00:00-06:00">Published on January 2, 2023.</time></p></div></div>

So they allowed messages to accumulate and let it drive them crazy, he explains. &#34;You process your email. You have to delete or defer it. God forbid, you have turn it into a task or put it on a calendar. Six years from now, that pile has gotten taller and taller and everybody&#39;s still carrying around that secret shame.&#34;</p><p>But if you you part from the assumption that it is impossible to handle everything – and the majority of information thrown at you is not important – you can focus on what matters to you.</p><h2>Whatever you do, don&#39;t delete everything</h2><p>If you&#39;re shuddering at the thought of tackling everything you have left over from the last year (or for some of us, the last decade) and want to press the &#34;delete&#34; button immediately – don&#39;t do it.</p><p>Instead, narrow down the most important things in all of your inboxes and focus on that.</p><p>It&#39;s hard for people to imagine tackling a mountain of messages, and know what is important and what isn&#39;t important straight away, Mann says. &#34;It would be as for me to say &#39;ah you idiot, you look at your email too much, what is wrong with you?&#39; But some people say &#39;if I take longer than 90 seconds to respond to an email, I might lose my job. In this case, okay, you have to check your email.&#34;</p><p>But if you aren&#39;t in that situation, and find yourself checking your messages constantly – you will find it can stop you from doing any other work. Mann recommends checking your email at set times every day: when you first walk into the office, at lunch time and before you leave, for example.</p><h2>Allow yourself time to switch off</h2><p>Take inspiration from a time before emails and mobile phones and switch off periodically. Whatever you do, don&#39;t check your messages – not even on Twitter.</p><p>&#34;People don&#39;t vacation like they used to. But we&#39;ve all had that experience at some point, especially in the pre Wi-Fi, pre smartphone days, of literally being incapable of checking their emails,&#34; Mann explains.</p><p>&#34;When you come back, you might say &#39;Oh my god, there&#39;s so much of this&#39;. But then you realise, I didn&#39;t even see this email and somehow the world kept spinning. I&#39;m not saying you should do that every day. But I&#39;m saying remember that feeling.&#34;</p><h2>Don&#39;t be an inbox dick</h2><p>Do unto other people&#39;s inboxes what you would have done to yours. If you hope that people will stop bombarding you with phone calls, messages and emails – make sure you aren&#39;t guilty of doing the same.</p><p>Don&#39;t be afraid to confront people who try to bombard you with information that you don&#39;t consider important, Mann says. But before you do, make sure you aren&#39;t guilty of calling someone straight after sending an email, or becoming angry if they don&#39;t respond to your Twitter message straight away.</p><p>&#34;Everybody is overwhelmed. A lot of people are just punting things to the next person and cc&#39;ing and bcc&#39;ing or calling and generating this volume of <em>stuff</em>,&#34; Mann explains. &#34;I think we would all agree it&#39;s insane to act like a Viagra ad or a Bitcoin deposit ad is as important as an email from your boss. But have we really accepted that?&#34;</p><p>That&#39;s the real philosophical jumping-off point that goes for any of these inboxes, he says. &#34;We want to blame the system and the teams and the culture, understandably, for how we got here.
