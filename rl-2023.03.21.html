The difference between docker (or podman, or containerd) <code>attach</code> and <code>exec</code> commands is a common source of confusion. And it&#39;s understandable - these two commands have similar arguments and, at first sight, similar behavior. However, <code>attach</code> and <code>exec</code> aren&#39;t interchangeable. They aim to cover different use cases, and the implementation of the commands also differs. But still, it might be hard to remember when to use which command.</p>
<p>Since I&#39;m no fan of brute memorization, here is my recipe of how I managed to internalize the difference. Long story short, connecting the dots between the knowledge of what containers really are under the hood and these two commands helped to grasp the difference almost instantly. And like any true understanding, it freed me from relying only on my memory and gave me a chance to extrapolate the knowledge on a similar tech such as Kubernetes 😉

<h2 id="container-management---look-inside">Container management - look inside</h2>
<p>First, a quick recap of how docker architecture looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/containers-101-attach-vs-exec/docker-containerd-runc-2000-opt.png" alt="Docker layered architecture."/>
</p>

<p>Three key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Container management architecture is layered</li>
<li>A container is <del>a regular process</del> <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/oci-containers/">an isolated and restricted environment + a process</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/series/implementing-container-manager/">There is a shim component in between the container manager and the container</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-attach-command-do">What does <code>attach</code> command do</h2>
<p>Inside a container, there is a regular Linux process. As every normal process, it has <em>stdio</em> streams - <em>stdin</em>, <em>stdout</em>, and <em>stderr</em>. But what happens to these streams when a container is started in the detached (i.e., daemon-like) mode:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -d nginx
</code></pre>
<p>Back in the day, when you started a process as a daemon (i.e., detaching it from the starter process), it would be reparented to <em>PID 1</em>, and its stdio streams would be simply closed. However, we all know how handy it is to use <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em> streams for logging nowadays, thanks to containers! </p>
<p>Docker came up with a clever idea of putting an extra process between the container and the rest of the system, called a <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/implementing-container-runtime-shim/">container runtime shim</a>. In the example above, the container manager actually starts a shim process, that in turn, uses an OCI-compatible runtime (e.g., runc) to start the actual container.</p>
<p>This is the shim process that becomes a daemon - it&#39;s reparented to <em>PID 1</em>, and its <em>stdio</em> streams are closed:</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/containers-101-attach-vs-exec/ppid-1-2000-opt.png" alt="Container runtime shim is reparented to PID 1."/></p><p><i><code>ps axfo pid,ppid,command</code></i></p>
</div>

<p>However, the shim takes control over the container&#39;s <em>stdio</em> streams!</p>
<p>The daemonized shim process reads from the container&#39;s <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em> and dumps the read bytes to the log driver. By default, the shim closes the container&#39;s <em>stdin</em> stream, but it can keep it open if <code>-i</code> was passed to the corresponding <code>docker run</code> command.</p>
<p>Container runtime shim actually acts as a server! It provides RPC means (for instance, a UNIX socket) to connect to it. And when you do so, it starts streaming the container&#39;s <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em> back to your end of the socket. It also can read from this socket and forward data to the container&#39;s <em>stdin</em>. Hence, you kind of <strong><em>attach</em></strong> to the container&#39;s <em>stdio</em> streams!</p>
<p>So, finally, when you run <code>docker attach &lt;container&gt;</code>, you basically create a relay:</p>
<pre><code>terminal &lt;-&gt; docker &lt;-&gt; dockerd &lt;-&gt; shim &lt;-&gt; container&#39;s stdio streams
</code></pre>


<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/containers-101-attach-vs-exec/docker-attach-2000-opt.png" alt="docker attach command illustrated."/>
</p>

<h2 id="difference-between-attach-and-logs">Difference between <code>attach</code> and <code>logs</code></h2>
<p>On the diagram above, <code>docker attach</code> streams the container&#39;s logs back to the terminal. However, the <code>docker logs</code> command does a similar thing. So, what&#39;s the difference?</p>
<p>The <code>logs</code> command provides various options to filter the logs while <code>attach</code> in that regard acts as a simple <code>tail</code>. But what&#39;s even more important is that the stream established by the <code>logs</code> command is always unidirectional and connected to the container&#39;s logs, not the container&#39;s <em>stdio</em> streams directly.</p>
<p>The <code>logs</code> command simply streams the content of the container&#39;s logs back to your terminal, and that&#39;s it. So, regardless of how you created your container (interactive or non-interactive, controlled by a pseudo-terminal or not), you cannot accidentally impact the container while using the <code>logs</code> command.</p>
<p>However, when <code>attach</code> is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a container was created in the interactive mode (<code>-i</code>), everything you type in the terminal after <code>attach</code>-ing to the container will be sent to its <em>stdin</em>.</li>
<li>You can (intentionally or accidentally) send a signal to the container - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49226544/1201488">for instance, hitting <code>ctrl+c</code> on your end while attached sends <code>SIGINT</code> to the container</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about it → <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/linux-pty-what-powers-docker-attach-functionality/">Linux PTY - How docker attach and docker exec Commands Work Inside</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-exec-command-do">What does <code>exec</code> command do</h2>
<p>I hope the <code>attach</code> command has been sorted out by now. So, it&#39;s time to tackle the <code>exec</code> counterpart!</p>
<p>The <code>exec</code> command is actually a totally different story. In the case of <code>attach</code>, we were connecting our terminal to an existing container (read, process). However, the <code>exec</code> command starts a totally new container! In other words, <code>exec</code> is a form of the <code>run</code> command (which itself is just a shortcut for <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/8958f93039ab90be53d803cd7e231a775f644451/runtime.md#create"><code>create</code></a> + <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/8958f93039ab90be53d803cd7e231a775f644451/runtime.md#start"><code>start</code></a>).</p>


<p>But why then <code>docker exec --help</code> says:</p>
<pre><code>Usage:  docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

Run a command in a running container
</code></pre>
<p>The trick here is that the auxiliary container created by the <code>exec</code> command shares all the isolation boundaries of the target container! I.e., the same <em>net</em>, <em>pid</em>, <em>mount</em>, etc. namespaces, same <em>cgroups</em> hierarchy, etc. So, from the outside, <strong>it feels like running a command inside of an existing container</strong>.</p>
<p>The confusion of <code>attach</code> and <code>exec</code> commands arises because the <code>exec</code>-uted command is also a process with its own <em>stdio</em> streams. So, you can choose whether to <code>exec</code> in detached mode, whether to keep the <em>stdin</em> open, whether to allocate a pseudo-TTY, etc. Also, when <code>exec</code>-ing, the relay looks quite similarly:</p>
<pre><code>terminal &lt;-&gt; docker-cli &lt;-&gt; dockerd &lt;-&gt; shim &lt;-&gt; command&#39;s stdio streams
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/containers-101-attach-vs-exec/docker-exec-2000-opt.png" alt="docker exec command illustrated."/>
</p>

<h2 id="other-implementations">Other implementations</h2>
<p>The above diagrams and examples were mostly about docker, but other container managers, such as <em>containerd</em> or <em>cri-o</em> behave similarly when it comes to <code>run</code>, <code>exec</code>, <code>attach</code>, or <code>logs</code> commands.</p>
<p><em>Podman</em> is probably the most prominent example of a daemon-less container manager. However, even podman employs container runtime shims. There is just one less hop in the relay when you <code>attach</code> to a podman&#39;s container.</p>
<p>The interesting specimen is Kubernetes, though. Kubernetes doesn&#39;t manage containers directly. Instead, every cluster node has a local agent, called <em>kubelet</em>, that in turn expects a compatible container runtime to be present on the node. However, on the lowest level, there are still the same shims and processes:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/containers-101-attach-vs-exec/docker-and-kubernetes-example-2000-opt.png" alt="Typical container management architecture."/>
</p>

<p>Much like docker, Kubernetes&#39; command-line client (<code>kubectl</code>) also provides <code>exec</code>, <code>attach</code>, and <code>logs</code> commands with a similar UX. The difference is that Kubernetes operates in terms of Pods and not containers. Luckily, <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/">pods are just groups of semi-fused containers</a>, so all the stuff we learned so far is still applicable.</p>
<p>Since <code>attach</code>-ing, <code>logs</code>-ing, and <code>exec</code>-ing works on the container level, every <code>kubectl attach</code>, <code>kubectl logs</code>, and <code>kubectl exec</code> needs to specify the target container (<code>-c &lt;name&gt;</code>) in addition to the pod name. Unless the pod was annotated with <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container</code>, of course.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/containers-101-attach-vs-exec/cri-2000-opt.png" alt="Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)."/>
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers are isolated and restricted execution environments.</li>
<li>Conventionally, there is one main process per container.</li>
<li>Containers are typically started in the detached mode (i.e., like daemons).</li>
<li>Container runtime shim wraps the container process and streams its <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em> to logs.</li>
<li>Runtime shim allows <code>attach</code>-ing to it to wire the terminal with the container&#39;s <em>stdio</em> stream.</li>
<li>It&#39;s possible to start a container reusing the isolation primitives of an already running container.</li>
<li>The <code>exec</code> command is similar to the <code>run</code> command with all the namespaces and cgroups reused from another container.</li>
<li>Since <code>exec</code>-ing by default happens in the <em>attached</em> mode, it might look similar to the <code>attach</code> command, but its purpose and implementation are quite different.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kafka is a data streaming system that allows developers to react to new events as they occur in real time. Kafka architecture consists of a storage layer and a compute layer. The storage layer is designed to store data efficiently and is a distributed system such that if your storage needs grow over time you can easily scale out the system to accommodate the growth. The compute layer consists of four core components—the producer, consumer, streams, and connector APIs, which allow Kafka to scale applications across distributed systems. In this guide, we’ll delve into each component of Kafka’s internal architecture and how it works.</p>
<h3 id="producer-and-consumer-apis">Producer and Consumer APIs</h3>
<p>The foundation of Kafka’s powerful application layer is two primitive APIs for accessing the storage—the producer API for writing events and the consumer API for reading them. On top of these are APIs built for integration and processing.</p>
<h3 id="kafka-connect">Kafka Connect</h3>
<p>Kafka Connect, which is built on top of the producer and consumer APIs, provides a simple way to integrate data across Kafka and external systems. Source connectors bring data from external systems and produce it to Kafka topics. Sink connectors take data from Kafka topics and write it to external systems.</p>
<h3 id="kafka-streams">Kafka Streams</h3>
<p>For processing events as they arrive, we have Kafka Streams, a Java library that is built on top of the producer and consumer APIs. Kafka Streams allows you to perform real-time stream processing, powerful transformations, and aggregations of event data.</p>
<h3 id="ksqldb">ksqlDB</h3>
<p>Building on the foundation of Kafka Streams, we also have ksqlDB, a streaming database which allows for similar processing but with a declarative SQL-like syntax.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-event-in-stream-processing">What Is an Event in Stream Processing?</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/gt6dp23g0g38/5MbVpGOuhfHHY2Ni55Y0Vq/42ba76e818dea48b4b5687c3590bee17/Kafka_Internals_005.png" alt="inline-pic-1"/></p>
<p>An event is a record of something that happened that also provides information about what happened. Examples of events are customer orders, payments, clicks on a website, or sensor readings. An event shouldn’t be too large. A 10GB video is not a good event. A reference to the location of that video in an object store is.</p>
<p>An event record consists of a timestamp, a key, a value, and optional headers. The event payload is usually stored in the value. The key is also optional, but very helpful for event ordering, colocating events across topics, and key-based storage or compaction.</p>
<h2 id="record-schema">Record Schema</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/gt6dp23g0g38/33K4H01OUsnYyR7z4dzRkj/d07131ca9752ba363792844e887c7f48/Kafka_Internals_006.png" alt="inline-pic-schema"/></p>
<p>In Kafka, the key and value are stored as byte arrays which means that clients can work with any type of data that can be serialized to bytes. A popular format among Kafka users is Avro, which is also supported by Confluent Schema Registry.</p>
<p>When integrated with Schema Registry, the first byte of an event will be a magic byte which signifies that this event is using a schema in the Schema Registry. The next four bytes make up the schema ID that can be used to retrieve the schema from the registry, and the rest of the bytes contain the event itself. Schema Registry also supports Protobuf and JSON schema formats.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-topics">Kafka Topics</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/gt6dp23g0g38/J2Y8oV2hoVWLv8u7sJ2v6/271fa3dde5d47e3a5980ad51fdd8b331/Kafka_Internals_007.png" alt="inline-pic-topic"/></p>
<p>A key concept in Kafka is the topic. Topics are append-only, immutable logs of events. Typically, events of the same type, or events that are in some way related, would go into the same topic. Kafka producers write events to topics and Kafka consumers read from topics.</p>
<h3 id="kafka-topic-partitions">Kafka Topic Partitions</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/gt6dp23g0g38/ODHQiu10QMZJ4bBbeQcvG/024159856d3361aaac482da28979acf6/Kafka_Internals_009.png" alt="inline-pic-partition-2"/></p>
<p>In order to distribute the storage and processing of events in a topic, Kafka uses the concept of partitions. A topic is made up of one or more partitions and these partitions can reside on different nodes in the Kafka cluster.</p>
<p>The partition is the main unit of storage for Kafka events, although with Tiered Storage, which we’ll talk about later, some event storage is moved off of partitions. The partition is also the main unit of parallelism. Events can be produced to a topic in parallel by writing to multiple partitions at the same time. Likewise, consumers can spread their workload by individual consumer instances reading from different partitions. If we only used one partition, we could only effectively use one consumer instance.</p>
<p>Within the partition, each event is given a unique identifier called an offset. The offset for a given partition will continue to grow as events are added, and offsets are never reused. The offset has many uses in Kafka, among them are consumers keeping track of which events have been processed.</p>

All were willing to let the researchers track their lives, from childhood troubles to first loves to final days.</p><p>Every five years, the researchers gathered health records from the participants. They asked detailed questions about their lives at two-year intervals, and, in later years, took DNA samples and performed brain scans. Twenty-five of the participants even donated their brains to the study after their deaths.</p><p>Now, 85 years later, the <a href="https://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard Study of Adult Development</a> has expanded to three generations and more than 1,300 descendants of the original subjects; it is, according to the researchers, the longest-running in-depth study on human happiness in the world.</p><p>From all the data, one very clear finding has emerged: <strong>Strong relationships are what make for a happy life.</strong> More than wealth, I.Q. or social class, it’s the robustness of our bonds that most determines whether we feel fulfilled.</p></div><div><h2 id="link-23a009b">How to build your social bonds for more joy</h2><p>In a new book, “The Good Life: Lessons From the World’s Longest Scientific Study of Happiness,” Dr. Bob Waldinger, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the study’s fourth director, and Marc Schulz, an associate director of the study and a psychology professor at Bryn Mawr College, have distilled the study’s insights.</p><p>If you’re going to do one thing this year to ensure your own health and happiness, the authors maintain, find the time to nurture and develop relationships. To help get you started, Dr. Waldinger and I have created this challenge — seven simple exercises, starting with taking today’s quiz.</p><p>Dr. Waldinger and Dr. Schulz have coined a term for the process of assessing and treating the health of our relationships: “social fitness.” It’s just as crucial as physical fitness, said Dr. Waldinger, who added that neglected relationships can atrophy, like muscles. “Our social life is a living system, and it needs exercise,” he said. “It’s a choice you make to invest in, week by week, year by year — one that has huge benefits.”</p><h2 id="link-71048e28">Why ‘social fitness’ matters</h2><p>The Harvard study is far from the only one to have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416486/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found a link</a> between our relationships and happiness. Ample research shows that people who are more socially connected <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.717164/full#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20stress%2Dbuffering,prolonged%20HPA%20and%20SAM%20activation." title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live longer</a> and are more protected against <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473615/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stress</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29792097/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(22)00199-4/fulltext" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declines</a> in memory and language.</p><p>Loneliness, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/nyregion/loneliness-epidemic.html" title="">damages our physical health</a>. “I believe loneliness is one of the defining public health concerns of our time,” Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told me in an email. While the pandemic exacerbated loneliness, he added, “it also helped many people take stock of their lives and reflect more deeply on how important their relationships are. That means taking steps in our day-to-day lives to invest in them.”</p></div><div><p>It’s not just your bonds with friends and family that are crucial to happiness. It’s your relationships with romantic partners and community groups. It’s the friendly conversation with your mail carrier or the acquaintance you see at the dog run.</p><h2 id="link-33d4386b">Take the quiz</h2><p>Today, you will identify the areas of your life in which you would like to be more connected. “Maybe you’ve got lots of people to have fun with, but you don’t have anyone to confide in about really personal, private things,” Dr. Waldinger said. “Or maybe you’ve got lots of people to confide in but don’t have anyone to have fun with.”</p><p>A few things before you begin:</p><p><strong>There is no right number of friends. </strong>Don’t get hung up on numbers, Dr. Waldinger said. It’s the quality of your relationships, not the quantity, so try to discern what is most fulfilling for you (our quiz will help give you some perspective).</p><p><strong>You don’t need to be an extrovert to improve your social fitness. </strong>While adult friendships require effort, happiness is not out of reach for you if you are shy or introverted, Dr. Waldinger said. You can engage with others in quieter settings around things that you care about. Try small, controlled activities such as a knitting group, a computer programming class, hiking or working in a community garden.</p><p><strong>It’s never too late. </strong>People often assume that it’s too late for them to build relationships, Dr. Waldinger said, but that’s never the case. He points to many stories in “The Good Life” about people who made connections later in life, like a lonely 68-year-old who joined a gym after he’d retired. Three months later, he had amassed more friends than he’d ever had in his life.</p></div><div><hr/><h2 id="link-663ccf4f">From the Friendship Files: Amy and Al</h2><p><em>Each day of the challenge, we’ll be sharing stories of meaningful friendships collected from readers across the country. We’d love to hear yours — tell your own tale of friendship </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/well/friendship-callout.html" title=""><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Amy Pechukas met her friend Al in 2018 when she rented the apartment under his in Northampton, Mass. They didn’t connect immediately. Amy, now 42, worked four jobs and thought Al, 76, was a curmudgeon with questionable boundaries. He helped look after their two-family home and would frequently enter<strong> </strong>her apartment to check on her two cats and two dogs.</p></div><div><p>But Al’s peculiar brand of kindness grew on her. “He often pops in for a conversation spontaneously, at times when I need a lift, and we end up talking for hours,” she said. “We go for evening walks and argue about the route.”</p><p>Covid brought them even closer. During lockdown, they would meet in the driveway to talk about the virus or politics. Amy made a Thanksgiving meal, which they ate outside on their porch with electric blankets on their laps. They have celebrated the holiday together ever since.</p><p>Al can still be overbearing. He has firm ideas about the way things should be done around the home, like the “right” way to rake the leaves. Every summer, he frets that Amy’s elderly cat, who grows lazy in the heat, is on the verge of death.</p><p>But Amy feels deep gratitude for their unexpected friendship, and for the constant, unselfish care Al has shown her and her pets. “When my dog got very sick a year ago and needed me to do round-the-clock care for her, I would come home on occasion to find Al in my kitchen doing my dishes,” she recalled. “‘You can’t do everything, Amy,’ he’d say. ‘You’re doing a great job.’”</p><p>Though Al does not say it outright, Amy knows he worries she might move out. She recently interviewed for a position out of state, and Al told her several times that it sounded terrible — reminding her that there were other jobs closer by.</p><p>“We just have a lot of fun,” she said. “We like to quote movie lines endlessly, we’ll do that for, like, two hours straight. Last winter we went ice skating in the cemetery because it was flooded. Al’s just a good person.” <em>— Catherine Pearson</em></p></div></section></article></div>
