Reading the thought-provoking &#34;<a href="https://without.boats/blog/patterns-and-abstractions/">Patterns &amp;
Abstractions</a>&#34; post reminded me of a long-held opinion I have about
programming language design: we have a tendency to keep adding
features to a language until it becomes so big <span>[1]</span>
that its sheer size makes it difficult to use reliably. Since most of us
spend most of our time programming in one language, it can be difficult
to see a common trend amongst languages in general.


</p><h2>Language size over time</h2>
<p>Let me start with a concrete example. I started using Python around version
1.3, though the first version I really remember was 1.4 <span>[2]</span>. Python 1.5 was a real improvement, adding the <code>assert</code>
statement, nested packages (&#34;hierarchical modules&#34; in the release notes), and
the <code>re</code> regular expression module — things that I suspect
nearly every modern Python programmer finds useful. At that point, Python was
still a relatively small language, to the extent that you could reasonably
expect to store nearly every detail about it (and its implementation!) in your
head.

</p><p>Python 1.6 added support for unicode — support that was clearly
useful, but which turned out to be sufficiently awkward that (somewhat) fixing
that awkwardness turned out to be a major cause underlying the schism between
Python 2 and 3. As Python 1.6 turned to 2.0 and beyond, this formerly small
language kept adding features, many of which I find useful (e.g. list
comprehensions), but each of which has inevitably made the language bigger.

</p><p>In retrospect, Python 1.5 was probably the last version of Python that
someone with my limited brainpower could reasonably expect to fully understand.
By the time of Python 2.7, Python was definitely a big language, and it has
only grown in size since then. I doubt there are many people who could claim
they understood every detail of Python 2.7, and there is probably no one who
claims that of recent versions of Python 3.


</p><h2>The criteria for language features</h2>
<p>How did Python become a big language? The initial version of Python
was small, and the first several versions deliberately tried to maintain
that smallness: most feature suggestions were explicitly rejected on the
grounds that they would make the language too big. At some point (perhaps
between Python 1.6 and Python 2.0?) it seemed to me that something changed:
features were not rejected solely on the grounds of making the language too
big, but on the grounds that they didn&#39;t fix an important enough problem.

</p><p>The difference between these two criteria might seem minor, but &#34;reject a
design if it doesn&#39;t solve an important problem&#34; implicitly downgrades the size
of the language as a concern in and of itself. As soon as a language&#39;s
designers stop worrying about the size of the language, it seems inevitable to
me that the language will grow almost without bound. Certainly, Python
looks set to keep on adding new features.

</p><p>Although I&#39;ve used Python as an example, I could have chosen many other
languages. For example, although Java was never what I&#39;d call a small
language, it had many years of fairly minor language changes before adding
generics to Java 1.5 — that seemed to be the point at which
Java began its journey to the large language it now is. Haskell started
off as a fairly small ML-inspired language, but is now a very large language
(albeit one can opt-in or out from many features in the standard compiler).
JavaScript has gone from a long-weekend design to a rather large
language. I know a lot less about languages like C# and the like, but I
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they&#39;ve gone, or are going, through something similar.

</p><p>These days I do most of my programming at Rust, a language which
is already big, but which is perhaps now being forced to think about whether
it wants to become very big or not. For example, if preventing Rust
getting too big is a goal, it&#39;s hard to imagine the recently proposed <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/02/23/keyword-generics-progress-report-feb-2023.html">keyword
generics initiative</a> being accepted, even though it clearly solves a
problem. On the other hand, Rust has already added dedicated support
for async/await, so is it a good idea to cleave the library system in two?
Whatever the outcome is, some people will be unhappy — these
decisions aren&#39;t easy!

</p><p>Why does this happen? Well, no programming language is perfect: there are
always use cases it doesn&#39;t support well. In many cases, growing the language
in size helps it better support those use cases better. Since there are an
unbounded number of potential use cases, there is thus always &#34;more&#34; language
design that we can do, each time making the language a little bigger. As
<a href="https://without.boats/blog/patterns-and-abstractions/">Patterns &amp;
Abstractions</a> points out, one continual temptation is to move
&#34;patterns&#34; (i.e. standard idioms of use) to &#34;abstractions&#34; (i.e. language
features). There are advantages to such moves: languages can, for
example, give better error messages and better optimise &#34;abstractions&#34;. But
there is also a cost: patterns do not affect a language&#39;s size, but abstractions
do. Only some user&#39;s of a language will encounter a given pattern, but nearly
every user is at some point confronted by nearly every abstraction. This
quote from Bjarne Stroustrup in a <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/how-to-write-a-proposal.pdf">1992 document on
suggested C++ extensions</a> is relevant to many languages:

</p><blockquote>
Please also understand that there are dozens of reasonable extensions and
changes being proposed. If every extension that is reasonably well-defined,
clean and general, and would make life easier for a couple of hundred or couple
of thousand C++ programmers were accepted, the language would more than double
in size. We do not think this would be an advantage to the C++ community.
</blockquote>
<h2>Must all languages grow in size?</h2><p>

There are some interesting exceptions to the trend of languages growing over time.

</p><p>Lisp-based languages, particularly those in the Scheme tradition, tend to
maintain fairly small language cores. However, because of the extensive use of
macros, it&#39;s sometimes difficult to know how to classify &#34;language size&#34; in
such languages. I&#39;m far too out of date with, say, modern Racket to have an
informed opinion on its size.

</p><p>Lua was, and is, a small language — and, probably not
coincidentally, so is its implementation. Interestingly, as far as I have been able
to tell, one of the ways Lua&#39;s designers have kept the language evolving is to
regularly force (generally small) breaking changes on its user base. It&#39;s an
interesting trade-off, and not one that has been taken by any other language
that I can think of.

</p><p>Perhaps the best known (partial) exception is C. Modern C is a surprisingly
different language to the original C, but that evolution happens
rather slowly these days, with new versions of the C standard coming out around every 8-12
years. Each new versions tends to add few new language features, or even
standard functions, and tends to put at least as much effort into clarifying
parts of the language&#39;s semantics that have either always been unclear or which
have been rendered unclear by new hardware (see <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2023/why_arent_programming_language_specifications_comprehensive.html">Why
Aren&#39;t Programming Language Specifications Comprehensive?</a> for some
examples).

</p><p>My impression of C, as someone from the outside occasionally looking in, is
that those responsible for the C language standard probably consider
themselves to be more &#34;maintainers&#34; than &#34;designers&#34;: they want C to be a
useful language in the modern world, but they also clearly want to balance
that with not letting C grow too much bigger.

</p><p>One advantage C has is, ironically, C++: anyone who
wants &#34;C but with lots of new features&#34; can be told to go and use C++ instead
of growing C in size. Although it&#39;s difficult to distinguish cause from
effect, perhaps this has dissuaded those people who like adding new features
to languages from considering proposing them for C, when C++ is likely to be far
more receptive to their suggestions. Certainly, C++ is a huge language which keeps on
growing: Bjarne Stroustrup&#39;s recent-ish plea to &#34;<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0977r0.pdf">Remember
the Vasa</a>&#34; strikes a cautionary note that few would make about C.


</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>

Language designers face challenging trade-offs. Their languages can always be
made better for more users by adding new features, but doing so makes the
language bigger. At some point, languages become big enough that few users can
understand all of the language — but nearly every user of a language will
at least occasionally encounter nearly every feature. When users encounter
features they don&#39;t understand, their reactions can vary from surprise to worry
— if they notice at all! The larger a language is, the easier it is
for users to misuse it without even knowing it.

</p><p>There is no easy way for us to to evaluate whether a new feature is
worth increasing a language&#39;s size for. It&#39;s also easier for those
people who will benefit from a feature to advocate for it than for those people
whose lives might (unwittingly) be made worse by it to advocate against it.
Even talking about &#34;size&#34; in anything other than a vague way <span>[3]</span> is hard: quantitative metrics like the size of a language&#39;s grammar or
compiler do not always correlate with the inherently qualitative measure of
&#34;cognitive load&#34; that two new features may impose on humans.

</p><p>Perhaps in an ideal world, language designers would at some point declare
their languages &#34;complete&#34;, capping the language&#39;s size. However, hardware and
other external factors change in ways that sometimes force even the most
conservative language to adapt. Even a language like C, which evolves slowly,
still evolves. And for as long as a language must evolve, it must have
designers. And for as long as a language has designers, there will always be
the temptation to add shiny new features.

</p><p>However, I think language designers can learn something useful from C&#39;s
example. While we can&#39;t declare our languages &#34;complete&#34; we can at some point
declare them to be in &#34;minimal evolution&#34; mode. This is decidedly less sexy than,
and offers fewer job opportunities to, language designers than continually adding new
features — but it also allows users to focus on the tasks they want to program,
rather than having to deal with ever more complexity. Slowly, over time, new
languages will come along which take the best ideas, simplify and unify them,
and can keep the field moving forwards. In general, in my opinion, that&#39;s
shown itself to be a more successful tactic than hoping that ever-bigger
languages can satisfy all users.

			<p>This post originally appeared in my <a href="https://mailchi.mp/wherewithall/should-i-create-a-performance-improvement-plan-for-my-direct-report">newsletter</a>. <a href="http://eepurl.com/dxUybL">Subscribe</a> to receive it!</p>
		

		<p>There’s lots to be said (and felt) about Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs); they’re often a step that a company takes when an employee is not meeting the expectations of their role, and their manager (or the company) is considering whether or not to terminate this person’s employment.</p>

<p>I’m oversimplifying here, but you can think of a PIP as explicit documentation about what a person needs to do differently within a specific timeframe, both to make sure there’s clarity and a shared understanding between them and the manager/company. If the employee is ultimately fired, a PIP also creates a paper trail, should the employee bring a lawsuit about their termination.</p>

<p>Often there’s a template that HR will suggest a manager use to draft the PIP, ensuring it outlines behaviors that the employee needs to demonstrate to their manager, (again, within a certain timeline).</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been on a PIP, you might have seen it as a signal that you’re about to be fired.</p>

<p>It’s not always the case that a PIP results in termination; I’ve definitely seen the PIP process help someone <em>finally</em> receive a clear articulation of what they need to do differently, which led to them adjusting their approach and getting the support they need to be successful! But because of how it’s traditionally used, PIPs are one of the most common HR processes I’ve seen that leave folks feeling unfairly treated by their managers and the company.</p>

<p>So what do you do, as a manager, when your own manager or HR rep suggests that you create a PIP for your underperforming direct report?</p>

<h2 id="why-might-you-create-a-pip">Why might you create a PIP?</h2>

<p>I have… a lot of complicated feelings about PIPs.</p>

<p>Documenting feedback around missed expectations is, of course, important, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s obvious value in writing down what’s expected of a person in a particular role; that’s why we have job descriptions and career ladders! And depending upon how these frameworks work at your organization, it can be helpful to further contextualize the responsibilities of a general role/level to your report’s specific situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person might not recognize that they need to behave differently, or that they’re not meeting expectations. So it’s crucial for managers to clearly, directly, and fairly give them a heads-up about the behavior gap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, performance feedback has already been given to someone, but it was in a piecemeal way over a stretch of time. So succinctly collecting all of the crucial feedback in one place might be the first time that they’re seeing everything put together. It might be a shock to them, but it’s really important to see the narrative that has developed about their performance, perhaps unbeknownst to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s unfair to use <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/tough-love-for-managers-giving-feedback/#3-i-get-that-youre-worried-about-how-someones-going-to-react-to-your-negative-feedback-especially-while-the-world-is-upside-down-but-youre-not-allowed-to-soften-the-feedback-so-much-that-your-report-doesnt-understand-what-they-should-do-next">fuzzy language</a> when your direct report is missing the mark. It’s also unfair to *only* use your mouthwords when giving essential feedback, and then expect that person to recall what was said going forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing down role expectations—and feedback about missed expectations—in a shared place that can be referred back to later is one of the most <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/performance-reviews-should-be-unsurprising-fair-and-motivating/">fair</a> things we can do as managers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So why do I have complicated feelings about PIPs? Here’s what usually makes me concerned when I hear a manager (or their HR rep) is considering creating a PIP. It’s complicated, and here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While a PIP restates role expectations and gives the employee a heads up that they need to behave differently, the typical PIP doesn’t give them new tools, training, or support, nor does it change their role, etc. So if a manager (or a company) doesn’t believe a person will be able to meet role expectations, then creating a PIP won’t help them—it’ll unkindly string them along through a weeks-long process with a destination only known to those delivering the PIP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A PIP helps the company (it’ll be documentation, if needed, for future inquiries from the legal department) but it doesn’t really change the situation for the employee. That said, a PIP <em>will</em> give the employee a heads up that termination of their employment is on the table, and signal that they might want to start looking for a new role, if they don’t feel like they can meet expectations in their current one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be problematic knock-on effects from PIPs that deserve their own post. For example, receiving a PIP changes other leaders’ perceptions of that employee, and this can have lasting effects on their ability to make progress in their career.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a case when a PIP <em>does</em> help an employee? Sure: if a person hasn’t received a clear signal (or hasn’t recognized) that they’re missing baseline role expectations, then writing a PIP can be that neon-red, flashing sign that they need to change their behavior.</p>

<p>So today, I want to offer you a step-by-step approach if you’re faced with the “to PIP, or not to PIP?” question as a manager. My goal is to help you navigate this process in a way that’s as fair as possible to your direct report, while recognizing that HR may require you to create one regardless of whether or not it could actually change the situation.</p>

<h2 id="pip-decision-framework">PIP Decision Framework</h2>

<p>When you’re faced with the question of whether or not to create a PIP, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Ask yourself, “Do I believe this person <strong>will be able to meet these expectations</strong> within 30 days, and consistently thereafter?” If the answer is “no”, consider terminating their employment with a healthy severance package, or finding a new role for them within the organization where they could be more successful.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you’re confident this person could begin meeting these expectations within 30 days—or if you’re just not sure yet—your next step is to brainstorm privately with the prompt, <strong>“What haven&#39;t I stated clearly/bluntly yet to this person about what I expect of someone in this role?”</strong></p>
	<p>It’s your job as a manager to succinctly and directly communicate the expectations of a role, and do the same when you see crucial gaps in someone’s performance of that role. Even if you’ve said these things to them before, there is always *something* that you can newly state or try to explain/describe differently for your direct report.</p></li>
	<li><p>Meet with your report. State (or reiterate) the gap between their work and what’s expected in their role (including anything you identified in step #2) as clearly as possible, to see if the new information/clarity/reframe changes things.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>After you’ve had the conversation in step #3—or at the end of that conversation, if it feels appropriate—ask your report, “<strong>What&#39;s in the way</strong> of meeting these expectations?”</p>
		<p>With this question, your goal is to figure out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Does this person see the <strong>importance</strong> of meeting these expectations?</li>
			<li>Do we see these expectations <strong>differently/disagree</strong> on what they mean or look like?</li>
			<li>Do they not have the <strong>resources</strong> required to meet the expectations? (Are they lacking time? Clarity? Answers from stakeholders?)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on how the “What’s in the way?” conversation goes, you’ll decide to create a PIP or not.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/">feedback equation</a> to underscore why this behavior change is relevant to the things they care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acknowledge that while you might disagree with each other about the importance of this behavior change, it’s a requirement of this role.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they continue to disagree on the importance of an expectation, restate that this behavior/outcome is expected of a person in their role, and you need them to meet that expectation. If they continue to disagree, <em>and</em> you believe that they are capable of meeting this expectation, you might create a PIP as one final attempt to communicate the importance of them meeting this expectation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-you-and-your-report-dont-have-a-shared-understanding-of-these-expectations">If you and your report don’t have a shared understanding of these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
	<li><p>Spend more time clarifying their role requirements with them. You might need to use different examples, identify new signals of what success looks like in the role, ask coaching questions to help them connect their own dots, etc. Don’t be afraid to be extremely direct in this conversation; you can be <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/be-directive-without-being-a-jerk/">blunt and clear without being a jerk</a>. Employ the variety of tools in your manager toolbox to try to gain that shared understanding of what’s expected.</p>
	<p>If you gain a shared understanding of the baseline requirements of the role, but your direct report still disagrees on the importance of a particular responsibility, revisit the section above, “<a href="#if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations</a>”.</p></li>
	<li><p>After you spend more time clarifying the expectations, you might revisit existing shared role documentation (job description, career ladder, etc.) and see where it needs to be updated or edited. Your goal is to create more clarity for *everybody* in that role about what’s expected of them, and what success looks like.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-they-dont-have-the-resources-to-meet-these-expectations">If they don’t have the resources to meet these expectations:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Partner with your report and HR to see if you can create (reasonable) accommodations for them. (For example, if someone is being blocked from getting timely information that’s necessary to do their job, I would partner with my report to figure out a workaround, or I’ll directly step in to get them what they need.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, clearly state that it is their responsibility in this role to develop/find those resources. (For example, it’s <em>their</em> responsibility to respond to questions via chat from their stakeholders within a certain timeframe during common work hours, or find a backup to take over if they need to step away from their computer.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-you-choose-to-create-a-pip">If you choose to create a PIP</h2>

<p>If you decide writing a PIP is the best next step for your employee (or if you’re required to write one by HR, your manager, etc.), make sure that the contents of the PIP are <strong>measurable</strong> and <strong>time-bound</strong>. A PIP is about communicating the importance of meeting a particular expectation, and making sure it’s possible that you and your direct report can both objectively see whether or not they’re meeting those expectations in <em>n</em> days/weeks.</p>

<p>After you write the first draft, re-read it to see if these are <strong>things you expect of anybody in this role</strong>, or if these are unique expectations you have for this specific person. I’ve seen drafts of PIPs where the manager has softened the expectations (like if the role requires writing a report every week, the manager wrote “deliver a report at least every other week” in the PIP). I’ve also seen managers refer to expectations <em>beyond</em> what’s normally required in the role (like a requirement to “present your findings to the VP” when the standard expectation of the role is to simply create a dashboard). The document should describe measurable, time-bound expectations that match what’s expected of <em>anybody</em> in this role.</p>

<p>PIPs are a complex tool that each organization approaches and utilizes differently. As someone’s manager, <strong>you do have agency</strong> to push back on what HR is asking you to do, ask for more time to give your report clear and specific feedback, suggest tweaks to the process, advocate for an alternative (like immediate termination with a severance package that supports the employee with pay and health insurance for a few months), etc. Your efforts may or may not change the path forward, but I believe it’s worth it to optimize for fairness to your employee during this really tough process while recognizing your responsibility as a manager.</p>
