		<p>There’s lots to be said (and felt) about Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs); they’re often a step that a company takes when an employee is not meeting the expectations of their role, and their manager (or the company) is considering whether or not to terminate this person’s employment.</p>

<p>I’m oversimplifying here, but you can think of a PIP as explicit documentation about what a person needs to do differently within a specific timeframe, both to make sure there’s clarity and a shared understanding between them and the manager/company. If the employee is ultimately fired, a PIP also creates a paper trail, should the employee bring a lawsuit about their termination.</p>

<p>Often there’s a template that HR will suggest a manager use to draft the PIP, ensuring it outlines behaviors that the employee needs to demonstrate to their manager, (again, within a certain timeline).</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been on a PIP, you might have seen it as a signal that you’re about to be fired.</p>

<p>It’s not always the case that a PIP results in termination; I’ve definitely seen the PIP process help someone <em>finally</em> receive a clear articulation of what they need to do differently, which led to them adjusting their approach and getting the support they need to be successful! But because of how it’s traditionally used, PIPs are one of the most common HR processes I’ve seen that leave folks feeling unfairly treated by their managers and the company.</p>

<p>So what do you do, as a manager, when your own manager or HR rep suggests that you create a PIP for your underperforming direct report?</p>

<h2 id="why-might-you-create-a-pip">Why might you create a PIP?</h2>

<p>I have… a lot of complicated feelings about PIPs.</p>

<p>Documenting feedback around missed expectations is, of course, important, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There’s obvious value in writing down what’s expected of a person in a particular role; that’s why we have job descriptions and career ladders! And depending upon how these frameworks work at your organization, it can be helpful to further contextualize the responsibilities of a general role/level to your report’s specific situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person might not recognize that they need to behave differently, or that they’re not meeting expectations. So it’s crucial for managers to clearly, directly, and fairly give them a heads-up about the behavior gap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, performance feedback has already been given to someone, but it was in a piecemeal way over a stretch of time. So succinctly collecting all of the crucial feedback in one place might be the first time that they’re seeing everything put together. It might be a shock to them, but it’s really important to see the narrative that has developed about their performance, perhaps unbeknownst to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s unfair to use <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/tough-love-for-managers-giving-feedback/#3-i-get-that-youre-worried-about-how-someones-going-to-react-to-your-negative-feedback-especially-while-the-world-is-upside-down-but-youre-not-allowed-to-soften-the-feedback-so-much-that-your-report-doesnt-understand-what-they-should-do-next">fuzzy language</a> when your direct report is missing the mark. It’s also unfair to *only* use your mouthwords when giving essential feedback, and then expect that person to recall what was said going forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing down role expectations—and feedback about missed expectations—in a shared place that can be referred back to later is one of the most <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/performance-reviews-should-be-unsurprising-fair-and-motivating/">fair</a> things we can do as managers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So why do I have complicated feelings about PIPs? Here’s what usually makes me concerned when I hear a manager (or their HR rep) is considering creating a PIP. It’s complicated, and here’s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While a PIP restates role expectations and gives the employee a heads up that they need to behave differently, the typical PIP doesn’t give them new tools, training, or support, nor does it change their role, etc. So if a manager (or a company) doesn’t believe a person will be able to meet role expectations, then creating a PIP won’t help them—it’ll unkindly string them along through a weeks-long process with a destination only known to those delivering the PIP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A PIP helps the company (it’ll be documentation, if needed, for future inquiries from the legal department) but it doesn’t really change the situation for the employee. That said, a PIP <em>will</em> give the employee a heads up that termination of their employment is on the table, and signal that they might want to start looking for a new role, if they don’t feel like they can meet expectations in their current one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be problematic knock-on effects from PIPs that deserve their own post. For example, receiving a PIP changes other leaders’ perceptions of that employee, and this can have lasting effects on their ability to make progress in their career.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a case when a PIP <em>does</em> help an employee? Sure: if a person hasn’t received a clear signal (or hasn’t recognized) that they’re missing baseline role expectations, then writing a PIP can be that neon-red, flashing sign that they need to change their behavior.</p>

<p>So today, I want to offer you a step-by-step approach if you’re faced with the “to PIP, or not to PIP?” question as a manager. My goal is to help you navigate this process in a way that’s as fair as possible to your direct report, while recognizing that HR may require you to create one regardless of whether or not it could actually change the situation.</p>

<h2 id="pip-decision-framework">PIP Decision Framework</h2>

<p>When you’re faced with the question of whether or not to create a PIP, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Ask yourself, “Do I believe this person <strong>will be able to meet these expectations</strong> within 30 days, and consistently thereafter?” If the answer is “no”, consider terminating their employment with a healthy severance package, or finding a new role for them within the organization where they could be more successful.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you’re confident this person could begin meeting these expectations within 30 days—or if you’re just not sure yet—your next step is to brainstorm privately with the prompt, <strong>“What haven&#39;t I stated clearly/bluntly yet to this person about what I expect of someone in this role?”</strong></p>
	<p>It’s your job as a manager to succinctly and directly communicate the expectations of a role, and do the same when you see crucial gaps in someone’s performance of that role. Even if you’ve said these things to them before, there is always *something* that you can newly state or try to explain/describe differently for your direct report.</p></li>
	<li><p>Meet with your report. State (or reiterate) the gap between their work and what’s expected in their role (including anything you identified in step #2) as clearly as possible, to see if the new information/clarity/reframe changes things.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>After you’ve had the conversation in step #3—or at the end of that conversation, if it feels appropriate—ask your report, “<strong>What&#39;s in the way</strong> of meeting these expectations?”</p>
		<p>With this question, your goal is to figure out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Does this person see the <strong>importance</strong> of meeting these expectations?</li>
			<li>Do we see these expectations <strong>differently/disagree</strong> on what they mean or look like?</li>
			<li>Do they not have the <strong>resources</strong> required to meet the expectations? (Are they lacking time? Clarity? Answers from stakeholders?)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on how the “What’s in the way?” conversation goes, you’ll decide to create a PIP or not.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/">feedback equation</a> to underscore why this behavior change is relevant to the things they care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acknowledge that while you might disagree with each other about the importance of this behavior change, it’s a requirement of this role.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they continue to disagree on the importance of an expectation, restate that this behavior/outcome is expected of a person in their role, and you need them to meet that expectation. If they continue to disagree, <em>and</em> you believe that they are capable of meeting this expectation, you might create a PIP as one final attempt to communicate the importance of them meeting this expectation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-you-and-your-report-dont-have-a-shared-understanding-of-these-expectations">If you and your report don’t have a shared understanding of these expectations:</h3>

<ol>
	<li><p>Spend more time clarifying their role requirements with them. You might need to use different examples, identify new signals of what success looks like in the role, ask coaching questions to help them connect their own dots, etc. Don’t be afraid to be extremely direct in this conversation; you can be <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/be-directive-without-being-a-jerk/">blunt and clear without being a jerk</a>. Employ the variety of tools in your manager toolbox to try to gain that shared understanding of what’s expected.</p>
	<p>If you gain a shared understanding of the baseline requirements of the role, but your direct report still disagrees on the importance of a particular responsibility, revisit the section above, “<a href="#if-your-report-doesnt-see-the-importance-of-meeting-these-expectations">If your report doesn’t see the importance of meeting these expectations</a>”.</p></li>
	<li><p>After you spend more time clarifying the expectations, you might revisit existing shared role documentation (job description, career ladder, etc.) and see where it needs to be updated or edited. Your goal is to create more clarity for *everybody* in that role about what’s expected of them, and what success looks like.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="if-they-dont-have-the-resources-to-meet-these-expectations">If they don’t have the resources to meet these expectations:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Partner with your report and HR to see if you can create (reasonable) accommodations for them. (For example, if someone is being blocked from getting timely information that’s necessary to do their job, I would partner with my report to figure out a workaround, or I’ll directly step in to get them what they need.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or, clearly state that it is their responsibility in this role to develop/find those resources. (For example, it’s <em>their</em> responsibility to respond to questions via chat from their stakeholders within a certain timeframe during common work hours, or find a backup to take over if they need to step away from their computer.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-you-choose-to-create-a-pip">If you choose to create a PIP</h2>

<p>If you decide writing a PIP is the best next step for your employee (or if you’re required to write one by HR, your manager, etc.), make sure that the contents of the PIP are <strong>measurable</strong> and <strong>time-bound</strong>. A PIP is about communicating the importance of meeting a particular expectation, and making sure it’s possible that you and your direct report can both objectively see whether or not they’re meeting those expectations in <em>n</em> days/weeks.</p>

<p>After you write the first draft, re-read it to see if these are <strong>things you expect of anybody in this role</strong>, or if these are unique expectations you have for this specific person. I’ve seen drafts of PIPs where the manager has softened the expectations (like if the role requires writing a report every week, the manager wrote “deliver a report at least every other week” in the PIP). I’ve also seen managers refer to expectations <em>beyond</em> what’s normally required in the role (like a requirement to “present your findings to the VP” when the standard expectation of the role is to simply create a dashboard). The document should describe measurable, time-bound expectations that match what’s expected of <em>anybody</em> in this role.</p>

<p>PIPs are a complex tool that each organization approaches and utilizes differently. As someone’s manager, <strong>you do have agency</strong> to push back on what HR is asking you to do, ask for more time to give your report clear and specific feedback, suggest tweaks to the process, advocate for an alternative (like immediate termination with a severance package that supports the employee with pay and health insurance for a few months), etc. Your efforts may or may not change the path forward, but I believe it’s worth it to optimize for fairness to your employee during this really tough process while recognizing your responsibility as a manager.</p>

            <p><span>On March 12, 1955,</span> Charlie Parker collapsed in the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter’s Upper East Side apartment after a three-day booze binge. The improviser of superhuman poise was dead at thirty-four, eliciting solemn observance from musicians and fans, particularly those who’d been hanging around Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem where, in the early 1940s, a new kind of music called bebop had been invented. “Bird has disintegrated into pure sound!” is said to have been overheard somewhere near the Five Spot on Cooper Square, the Beat tavern where much bad poetry was recited, and where some great musicians nightly turned the style that came out of Harlem into ever more febrile and kinked contortions. Part of the Bird enigma was the impossible fusion of musical angel and reptilian addict, a miraculously graceful artist who might steal your horn and pawn it for smack.</p>
<p>Four months after Bird’s death, his one-time personal assistant Miles Davis seduced everyone at the Newport Jazz Festival, performing a tune called “<a href="https://youtu.be/iWC5wBXyozM">Round Midnight</a>,” written by someone who had been part of the Minton’s scene but was still an underground figure: Thelonious Monk, who had only a handful of records under his belt and, then approaching forty, was still playing on other people’s dates. Indeed, he was the pianist behind Miles for the Newport performance, which would help the younger musician sign with Columbia records, putting him on the road to stardom. An oft-told anecdote has the two sharing a car back to New York. “You weren’t playing the tune right,” Monk says, to which Miles replies that he is just jealous, at which point Monk orders the car to pull over and takes the ferry to the city alone.</p>
<p>The Newport set came about midway through Monk’s career, which was long by the standards of jazz. Over three decades he played on more than a hundred records, collaborating with artists as different as Sonny Rollins and Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane and Clark Terry, Art Blakey and Oliver Nelson. From the first, he was revered by fellow musicians, even those who would later do away with harmony and structure, aspiring toward a kind of “free” jazz. “Of all the bop greats Monk’s influence seems second now only to that of Charlie Parker,” Amiri Baraka wrote in 1967. Monk was also a committed teacher, including to Rollins and Coltrane, who both spent mornings practicing at his tiny apartment on West Sixty-Third.</p>
<p>Commercial success, however, had a way of eluding Monk. His career began with sporadic recordings on the Blue Note and Prestige labels, made through the 1940s and 1950s, none of which sold well. Already struggling to support his family, his financial troubles worsened in 1951 when he was arrested—with his friend, the great bebop pianist Bud Powell—on drug charges and was left without his cabaret card for a half dozen years, preventing him from playing in nightclubs. Switching to the Riverside label in 1955, he found new momentum but only reached a wide public in 1962, when he was signed by Columbia records, joining a roster that included Miles Davis and Charles Mingus. After that, his profile dramatically grew; two years later he even appeared on the cover of <em>Time</em>. By his death in 1982, he had become a respectable pillar of the music’s evolution, as seen in Ken Burns’s 2001 PBS documentary <em>Jazz</em>. But neither a cult reputation as a pioneer of bebop nor American canonization quite does justice to Monk, who was simply one of the most imaginative composers of the twentieth century, a judgment that in my view does not require the qualifiers “jazz” or “American.”</p>
<p>What made Monk a great composer was his way of putting a tune together, and the stamp he put on pianism—his unique approach to chord voicing, phrasing and accent—was inseparable from his being a great thinker in song form. Like his hero Duke Ellington, he had a gift for reconciling musical experiment with the immediacy of pop, finding freedom in the constraints of a verse-chorus-bridge grammar that might otherwise default to clichés. Inventing a set of private aesthetic laws, he worked out their possibilities over the course of his career with admirable stubbornness and conviction. If the axioms were laid down at Blue Note (1947–1952), revised here and there at Prestige (1952–1954), the Riverside years (1955–1961), which I’ll zoom in on in what follows, showed what kinds of proofs could be argued from them.</p>
<h3>Record Changer</h3>
<p>Monk was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in 1917 in a home where he might have heard some live music: his father could bang out ragtime on the piano as well as play harmonica, as Robin Kelly notes in his staggeringly thorough biography, <em>Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</em> (2010)—from which this essay draws most of its factual information. The family relocated to New York City in 1922, moving into Phipps housing in the San Juan Hill neighborhood at West Sixty-Third Street where, at age six, Monk began taking piano lessons from a neighbor. Jazz was then dominated by swing bands like Duke’s, Count Basie’s, and Fletcher Henderson’s, and star soloists like Lester Young, Ben Webster, Louis Armstrong, and Benny Goodman. Piano was the stride style of James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, with Art Tatum at its dazzling apex. It was from that kind of playing that Monk developed a serious interest in the instrument. Dropping out of Stuyvesant High (where he had excelled in math), he honed his chops on the road, playing with a traveling evangelist for two years.</p>
<blockquote><p>He had a gift for reconciling musical experiment with the immediacy of pop.</p></blockquote>
<p>How and when began the private alchemy by which the stride style was given a modernist acid bath would be hard to pinpoint. By the time he was sitting in with Coleman Hawkins in 1944, however, Monk was comping so off the grid that musicians were squinting their eyes at him. It is sometimes said that he helped “invent” bebop, which is true to the extent that he played at Minton’s in the early 1940s with several of the genre’s pioneers—Parker, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, drummer Kenny Clarke—and insofar as his playing mostly broke with swing-era mannerisms. But the differences between him and other bebop virtuosos are more striking than the continuities. For all their blistering speed and invention, the likes of Bud, Bird, and Diz tended not to sing, rather letting their formidable chops do the talking. By contrast, Monk built up ideas from material implicit in the tune, always soloing with the melody in mind. This comes through vividly in his takes on standards like “<a href="https://youtu.be/CcEK8hP1frU">Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</a>,” or “<a href="https://youtu.be/3zRuMflW-30">Everything Happens to Me</a>,” or “<a href="https://youtu.be/T_lsD5g7mAY">I’ve Got It Bad</a>,” where each chord seems deliberated over, as if Monk is pausing to choose an expressive coloring that will best convey the melody.</p>
<p>At the same time, Monk had an original sound marked by angular phrasing, atypical chord voicings, and his beloved Tatum-ish glissandos. But it was also his tone, odd as that sounds in the case of an instrument as fixed in its design as the piano. Fingers rigidly horizontal over the keys, he played with both a bell-like purity and a harsh, percussive attack. Many initially heard sloppiness, mistakes, even incompetence. (Philip Larkin later called him an “elephant at the keyboard.”) Like the philistine who asserts that Dylan “can’t sing,” hearing Monk as a “bad” pianist misses something so fundamental you don’t know where to begin.</p>
<p>The early reception of Monk’s music was usually accompanied, and occasionally overshadowed, by his public image as a “weirdo.” Clichés repurposed by journalists (“The High Priest of Bop”), his own sartorial affectations (bamboo framed glasses, berets, and then more exotic head gear), and a brusque, at times irritable style of communication as a bandleader (when the twenty-two-year-old Sahib Shihab looked at the jagged melody of “<a href="https://youtu.be/xG-wHvGWvws">Who Knows</a>” during a 1947 session and said it was too difficult, Monk replied: “You a musician? You got a union card? Play it.”)—all this blurred into an aura of mere eccentricity, otherworldly disconnection from reality, becoming a form of kitsch. The myth was reinforced by Monk’s propensity for Zen-like aphorisms about musical aesthetics, such as the claim that the “inside of the tune is the part that makes the outside sound good.” By this he seems to have meant that the B section (the inside) casts back over the A section, revealing the song’s shape as it unfolds in time. Think of not knowing that a tunnel fans out and widens (until you get there) or of journeying through a circle and slowly discovering it is a sphere. Another Monkism was the importance of swinging at slow tempos, which made the push against the metronome more stretched and exaggerated, and so more expressive, maybe even more musical.</p>
<p>After a piece in <em>Down Beat</em> about the “Genius of Bop” caught the attention of the Blue Note label’s cofounder Alfred Lion, he and his wife Lorraine Gordon were invited (by its author William Gottlieb) over to Monk’s apartment, where they sat with their feet up on the bed while he played with his back to them. He was soon offered a contract with Blue Note, on which he recorded multiple dates—first in 1947, again in the early 1950s—of mostly original material, all of which would come out as <em>The Genius of Modern Music Volume 1</em> and <em>2</em> in 1951 and 1952. “<a href="https://youtu.be/s-d0ULekFFc">Criss Cross</a>,” an up-tempo, asymmetric tune from those first dates, is a good example of his compositional approach. The opening section is studded with obstacles, specifically an eighth rest and a quarter rest on either side of an A in the third measure, which throws off what the ear expects as the completion of the phrase. (For some reason, on a later recording of the tune for the Columbia LP <em>Criss Cross</em>, he removed that first rest, giving it a much straighter feel.) That section is then contrasted with a second idea, chromatically descending tones ping-ponging against a repeated G, a figure which, doubled in unison with Milt Jackson’s vibraphone, sounds like someone laughing.</p>
<p>The jazz historian and composer Gunther Schuller thought “Criss Cross” was exemplary of Monk’s musical language, calling it an abstract idea. That seems right enough, though Schuller also insisted that “Criss Cross” wasn’t technically a “song,” which is wrong. The Stravinsky-like placement of rests to create off-kilter accents, broken phrasing that works against the bar lines, and the general feeling of music assembled as if it were a Calder mobile—none of this prevents “Criss Cross” from coming off with the fizz of a pop single. And the same is true of other ostensibly “abstract” pieces from <em>The Genius of Modern Music</em>, like “<a href="https://youtu.be/NYj61DQzaQs">Off Minor</a>,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/yFn0pdpS_jY">Evidence</a>,” or “<a href="https://youtu.be/3_81Wv_hK-c">Misterioso</a>,” with its staggered major 6s rising and falling like a Slinky. These tunes are arresting not for their virtuosity but for their architecture and shape—how their inside expresses the outside and vice versa, to use Monk’s wonderfully accurate analogy. And this is not to mention ballads like “<a href="https://youtu.be/IrAfjW5qiyo">Round Midnight</a>,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/i2LBuj4GYtQ">Ask Me Now</a>,” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/u1O9YuXNbLs">Ruby, My Dear</a>,” which Ira Gitler described in his liner notes as conveying “sentiment without sentimentality.”</p>
<p>After the Blue Note records sold dismally, Monk moved in 1952 to Bob Weinstock’s Prestige records for a three-year contract, rearranging and rerecording a batch of songs he’d been playing for years. The obviously out-of-tune piano on the first Prestige disc ought to give a sense of the recording budget for these dates. One of them, plagued with mishaps and misunderstandings, features a take of “<a href="https://youtu.be/NxYlhw0A0wo">Friday the 13th</a>” that needed to be coached into overtime from the control room, chugging on over its gloomy riff for ten and a half minutes. Though sales were again not great, musicians were starting to pay attention, as was Orrin Keepnews—an industrious Columbia undergraduate who helped edit the jazz newsletter <em>The Record Changer</em> and had befriended Monk years earlier. Keepnews eventually lent Monk the $108 and change to get Prestige to end the contract and signed him to his own new venture, Riverside Records.</p>
<p>The suggestion that Monk devote his Riverside debut to a set of Duke Ellington tunes was Keepnews’s idea. It stemmed from his sense, as he put it in the notes for the sleeve of <em>Thelonious Monk Plays the Music of Duke Ellington</em> (1956), that it might be “helpful to know the precise structural and melodic starting point of a musician’s improvisations.” In other words, why not apply Monk’s slightly bent melodic imagination to songs everybody already knows? It proved to be an inspired idea. Right out of the gate, “<a href="https://youtu.be/0pU-5pEpfmE">It Don’t Mean A Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)</a>” merges Monk’s world with Duke’s, its stuttering, telegraphic one-note intro an apparent echo of “Thelonious” from the Blue Note sessions. On “<a href="https://youtu.be/dT-9-pkdzlI">Solitude</a>,” he finds piano shades that seem to get at Duke’s orchestrations, along with a wide-open stride style swinging under the right-hand melodies. Throughout, he takes up the material in an easy, graceful, somehow fundamentally singing approach. The same could be said for the covers on the second Riverside release, <em>The Unique Thelonious Monk</em> (1956), on which, to take one example, <a href="https://youtu.be/Xw9KzKJJjPs">Eubie Blake’s “Memories of You”</a> is <a href="https://youtu.be/BOJ1dfuvWqU">given</a> a halting half-stride solo treatment that feels both warm and anxious.</p>
<p>The third Riverside LP leaves the world of cover versions for original compositions arranged for a band that included Sonny Rollins and Max Roach. Kelley describes how the musicians had a tough time getting a good take of the title track, “<a href="https://youtu.be/AwlbjCzO9KU">Brilliant Corners</a>,” because of its huge intervallic leaps and tempo shifts. Steadfast in his conviction that music should be learned by ear, Monk would not share the charts, which exacerbated the problem. Left with twenty-five takes and no master, Keepnews cut them together with a razor blade for the version that’s on the record, a feat of studio wonkery rare for the period, especially in jazz. The album’s other masterpiece, “<a href="https://youtu.be/9fkmrkmoJHs">Pannonica</a>,” was named for Monk’s close friend and sometime caretaker, financial backer, and nurse—the Baroness in whose apartment Bird had died. It is a good example of “swinging at slow tempo,” its tipsy melody turning around like a revolving oval. There happened to be a celeste in the Reeves studio that day, prompting Monk to use it for the first go round on “Pannonica,” which adds a plunky lullaby sheen to the arrangement.</p>
<h3>Played Twice</h3>
<p>Whitney Balliett, who wrote about jazz for <em>The New Yorker</em> for almost fifty years, said of Monk that “his improvisations were molten Monk compositions and his compositions were frozen Monk improvisations.” A particularly extravagant instance of that thought is the outtake of “<a href="https://youtu.be/cUmPKG3jvP8">Round Midnight</a>,” recorded as part of the <em>Thelonious Himself</em> (1957) sessions and included on the <em>Complete Monk on Riverside</em> (1986) box set. Over the course of a glorious, open, twenty-two-minute take, Monk comes at the tune’s ideas from different angles, circling back elliptically to repeat whole sections, playing phrases out of order, like he’s turning an object around slowly and letting the light hit it in different spots. One begins to think of the track less as a discrete composition and more as an atmosphere, a distributed range of musical possibilities organized around the incomparable melody, which holds the pieces together like a recurring dream.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fingers rigidly horizontal over the piano keys, he played with both a bell-like purity and a harsh, percussive attack.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a good deal of gigging at the time, and Keepnews was conscientious about hauling mics around for possible releases. Sometimes live settings can bring out Monk’s rhythmic extremism more vividly than on record, as with a version of “<a href="https://youtu.be/_0Fq0kXAvrI">Evidence</a>,” recorded at the Five Spot in the summer of 1958. By treating the subdivisions of the bar as a kind of random number generator—playing on the <em>and</em> of 1, then on the 1 of the <em>next</em> bar, then the <em>and</em> of 3, then on 2 and so on—Monk creates an effect almost of meterlessness, a pointillist articulation at once spacey and tense, concluding on an F7 figure that, with its comically pasted-on feeling, suggests the whole thing is a prank. Of course, it is not a prank, and the tune is anything but meterless. Monk is being excessively careful with time, and the band is fussily counting while somehow swinging extra hard through it all. <em>Misterioso</em>, another Riverside live release, captures the quartet on a different night at the Five Spot that year, with Monk taking a solo on “<a href="https://youtu.be/Z1expiBv73k">Bye-Ya</a>” that turns the melody into a series of splashy clusters.</p>
<p>Monk’s arranging had always suggested that his work might be interestingly set for a big band, an experiment that first happened in composer Hall Overton’s Sixth Avenue loft. These rehearsals initially took place with the two of them seated at a piano, going through the charts and discussing arrangements, after which a ten-piece band was assembled and a concert booked. <em>The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall</em> (1959) reveals a band not always sure of what to do with Monk’s music, but which at times shows what could be done. “<a href="https://youtu.be/REpKq8Tj5sI">Little Rootie Tootie</a>,” features dissonant piano triplets working against bass-trumpet-alto unison lines; contrastive colors that add a new dimension to the earlier Prestige recording of the tune. On that night, he also played through one of his purest abstract compositions, “<a href="https://youtu.be/dyc3R3zlVco">Crespuscule With Nellie</a>,” which is dedicated to his infinitely patient best friend and wife, and somehow conveys the ups and downs of life, the surprises, and jolts, and the recurring tenderness of coming home to a family.</p>
<p>If asked to identify a single tune that best encapsulates Monk’s unique approach to composition, I would consider “<a href="https://youtu.be/wIB87eV4a7s">Played Twice</a>” from <em>5 by Monk by 5</em> (1959). It opens with three whacks on an open hi hat, then a figure enters suggesting the key of Db, followed by the band, which comes in a half step down, in C. Has a key change occurred two seconds in? In fact, it’s less a key change than a melody so strangely shaped it suggests modulation, and which soon moves from that apparent home base of C to a major 7 figure that, playing on another half step (between C and B), again lures us with chromaticism. Yet by the next phrase, a measure later, we’re back to Db! Once the shock wears off, you go look at the chart, which reveals an appealing mirror structure whereby half step chord voicings are reflected in half step moves in the melody, which are in turn somehow also reflected in how one section shifts to the next. It shouldn’t make any sense, but it does. It is also hummable and kind of rocks.</p>
<p>By 1962, Monk was ready to leave Riverside after a buildup of distrust toward Keepnews and some evidence of shady royalty handling and bookkeeping practices. Getting wind of this, a producer at Columbia records, Teo Macero, immediately shot off a note to the label administration, which offered Monk a deal with more money in advances than he’d ever seen. The records got slicker, the stereo more luxuriantly separated, the rooms (like the Thirtieth Street “church” where Glenn Gould’s <em>Goldberg Variations</em> and <em>West Side Story</em>, among others, were recorded) richer and bigger. The sound capture of the piano on the Columbia dates is like a gleaming Cadillac—and to overextend the analogy, on Riverside it’s a Honda Prelude, on Prestige a jalopy, and on Blue Note a Model-T (in good condition). But those fat advances have to be paid back, which necessitated some “hit-making.” It is likely that the financial pressure led to wrongheaded strategies, including some truly dismal canned “rock” composed by Macero.</p>
<p>A late Columbia studio LP <em>Underground</em> featured a cover depicting Monk sequestered in a bunker among strangely militarized paraphernalia—hand grenades, an automatic rifle, a Nazi officer held as prisoner, a TNT detonator of the sort Wile E. Coyote might order from the Acme Corporation—as well as a cow, empty wine and whiskey bottles, and “Vive la France” painted on the wall. The whole thing is super-confused, as if Columbia thought airbrushed Black power optics might be combined with a reboot of the “weirdo” brand to jump start sales. In any case, Monk did not fulfill the Columbia contract, as his occasional spells of bipolar catatonia, for which he had been misdiagnosed (first Thorazine for “depression” then electroshock for “schizophrenia”) gradually ceased to be episodes, becoming a general state of withdrawal. He slid deeper into silence, avoiding the piano, spending most of his time in New Jersey at the Baroness Pannonica’s house with her and her hundreds of cats. Many mornings he got fully dressed and then spent all day in bed.</p>
<h3>In Monk’s Wake</h3>
<p>A mark of Monk’s originality is the way others have found ways to elaborate upon it. Steve Lacy, Don Pullen, Anthony Braxton, and Abdullah Ibrahim, to name a few, all cut Monk records that are also extensions of their own aesthetic. Distinguished pianists from the next generation—Stanley Cowell, Marcus Roberts, and Gonzalo Rubalcaba come to mind—have taken up his quirks of keyboard phrasing in a sense perhaps comparable to the way Monk mashed up Johnson and Waller and Tatum. Terry Adams of NRBQ made a record of Monk covers that shows how amenable his music is to rhythm-and-blues combos of a sort that aren’t too far from rock-and-roll.</p>
<blockquote><p>Taking all the humble nonlinguistic bones of song, he bent them toward his own specific needs and vision.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Monk’s wholly original songwriting is his most lasting legacy. Taking intro, verse, refrain, bridge, coda, and “hook”—all the humble nonlinguistic bones of song—he bent them toward his own specific needs and vision. In this sense, he becomes part of a broader renaissance of American song in the second half of the twentieth century. We think of how Brian Wilson changed the concept of arrangement by approaching the multitrack studio as a set of timbral and dynamic possibilities, of how Dylan made vocal phrasing itself a medium of invention, of Frank Zappa’s whiplash edits between doo-wop and serialism, of Laura Nyro’s run-on sentence melodies, of Joni Mitchell’s way of thinking in open tunings, of Steely Dan spiking FM radio with queasily expanded chords and harmonies—and these last two certainly know their Monk.</p>
<p>If it seems a stretch to treat such examples as Monk-adjacent, that’s because there’s a tendency to think of songs as readymade schemas designed either to deliver a sing-along chorus or to reinforce insipid genre clichés. But a song is an infinitely elastic form. If approached the right way, its rules invite one to be <em>more</em> imaginative, its constraints give one <em>more</em> freedom—an understanding of freedom apparently preferable to Monk, who referred to “free jazz” as “getting rid of structure and simply piling a lot of notes one on top of the other.” While the seventy or so originals Monk wrote and recorded in his lifetime form a planet with its own laws and atmosphere, they are also in constant conversation with a tradition of song as a tightly rule-bound medium. When Monk said simply “jazz is freedom,” he might have been referring to his own strikingly original way of thinking and working in song form.</p>

To speed up development, many folks use frameworks and libraries that do some of the heavy lifting. When looking at modern Java applications, almost all of them contain dependencies from libraries developed by someone else.</p><p>Dependencies take up about 80 to 90 percent of the binary — so, we should take good care of them when creating a Java project. In this article, I’ll give you some advice and best practices for dealing with Java dependencies in your project.</p><ul><li><p><a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/blog/best-practices-for-managing-java-dependencies/#Why-be-more-aware-of-your-Java-dependencies">Why be more aware of your Java dependencies</a></p></li><li><p><a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/blog/best-practices-for-managing-java-dependencies/#Managing-Java-dependencies">Managing Java dependencies</a></p></li><li><p><a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/blog/best-practices-for-managing-java-dependencies/#Including-dependencies-in-your-Java-projects">Including dependencies in your Java projects</a></p></li><li><p><a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/blog/best-practices-for-managing-java-dependencies/#Update-your-Java-dependencies">Update your Java dependencies</a></p></li><li><p><a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/blog/best-practices-for-managing-java-dependencies/#Removing-Java-dependencies-from-your-project">Removing Java dependencies from your project</a></p></li></ul><h2>Why be more aware of your java dependencies</h2><p>When it comes to managing  code contributions, we generally turn to a process like <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/learn/code-review/">code reviews</a> for a first-pass quality assurance measure, before merging new code into our main branch. Check out our guide to <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/learn/code-review/java-tools/">Java code review tools</a> to learn more. Practicing pair programming is another way to cover this quality control process.</p><p>However, how we treat our dependencies differs greatly from how we treat our own code. On many occasions, dependencies are used without any form of validation. And on many occasions, those top-level dependencies pull in transitive dependencies, which can go multiple levels deep. For example, a 200 line Spring application with five direct dependencies can end up using 60 dependencies in total, which amounts to almost half a million lines of code being shipped to production.</p><p>Updating Java dependencies in legacy projects can be challenging. If they’re outdated, you’ll end up with a domino effect of compatibility issues, and updating a single library might mean updating several because of a <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/learn/security-vulnerability-exploits-threats/">bug or security issue</a>. If these Java dependencies change their API, you would need to rewrite your application in full.</p><p>Additionally, in many major enterprise applications, dependencies stay in the manifest file, even if they’re no longer used in the code. These unused dependencies are still available in your program.</p><p>All of this can lead to:</p><ul><li><p>Larger binaries that use more resources or start-up time</p></li><li><p>Possible collision in libraries when adding new dependencies.</p></li><li><p>Outdated libraries that contain bugs or security issues</p></li><li><p>Compatibility problems when updating libraries</p></li><li><p>And more</p></li></ul><h2>Managing Java dependencies</h2><p>One of the best practices for significantly using repositories, like Maven Central, is to set up your own repositories manager. This is a dedicated proxy server between your internal development and the public repositories — which will not only gives you faster and more stable builds, but also allows you to set up <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/open-source-policy/">policies</a> for Java packages. You can, for instance, block certain versions so they cannot be downloaded and used in your applications.</p><p>For more information about repository managers and a list of possible products, take a look at the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Maven documentation</a>.</p><h2>Including new dependencies in your Java project</h2><p>When you need to solve a problem, and there is a library available, you’ll likely want to include it in your Java dependency manifest files. However, before including, you should consider: </p><h3>Does it solve the problem?</h3><p>The main reason for importing a package is to solve your problem. The question is whether  the dependency you chose can do this. Also, does it solve the whole problem without introducing new challenges? If this isn’t the case, there might be better solutions out there.</p><h3>Do I need the (whole) package?</h3><p>Is it worth importing a large dependency, with many functions and data types, if you only need a single function? Sometimes, it might be easier and more manageable to write that function yourself. For instance, does it make sense to include entire Eclipse Collections if I only want to use the Tuple data type? Probably not.</p><p>A quick look at <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" tabindex="0">mvnrepository.com</a> shows me that this package is about 10MB</p><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-eclipse-main-library" loading="lazy" width="1270" height="692" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085492%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-eclipse-main-library.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085492%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-eclipse-main-library.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><p>Also, check to see if the dependencies you already have can do the job for you. Some similar functions or data types might already be available. On the other hand, including a new, extensive library can help you solve multiple problems at once — it all depends on the situation.</p><h3>How many contributors are there?</h3><p>We have a pretty low bus factor if the Java dependency you use has only one or just a few maintainers. What happens if the maintainer decides to quit, or doesn’t have time to fix a bug? Alternatively, you might also choose to contribute to the project yourself — making it more secure for everyone involved.</p><p>But, before including any dependencies in your project, be sure to check the core repository and see how many active maintainers there are.</p><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-github-contributors" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="201" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085382%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-github-contributors.png&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085382%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-github-contributors.png&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h3>Is it still maintained?</h3><p>If a package is no longer maintained you definitely do not want to rely on it. Before integrating a package, check if there are new pushes on the GitHub repository, and take a look at the release cycle of a package. This will give you an idea of how well maintained the package is.</p><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-2-hrs" loading="lazy" width="1366" height="280" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085494%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-2-hrs.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085494%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-2-hrs.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h3>What is the latest version of the package?</h3><p>Code examples can give you great insight on a particular Java dependency. However, these examples might be outdated, and the intended package might already be updated. Consider using the latest stable version. For Eclipse Collections, we see that the latest stable release is 11.1.0 from July 5, 2022 on mvnpackage.com. Consider using that version.</p><p>Note that the 11.1.0.M2 is also listed in this image. This is clearly a pre-release version. You should only include stable release versions in your production application unless you are absolutely sure. As a rule of thumb, please do not include versions that have a qualifier, like:</p><ul><li><p>alpha or a</p></li><li><p>beta or b</p></li><li><p>milestone or m</p></li><li><p>rc or cr</p></li><li><p>snapshot</p></li></ul><p>If a Java dependency has the qualifier GA or final, you can generally consider it a stable release version.</p><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-central" loading="lazy" width="1999" height="992" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085483%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-central.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085483%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-central.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h3>Are there any security vulnerabilities?</h3><p>Before you actively depend on a Java package, make sure you <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/learn/vulnerability-scanner/">scan it for known vulnerabilities</a>. The Snyk CLI is a great tool for scanning your Maven or Gradle file. If your library contains a security vulnerability, you might want to pick another package to depend on.</p><h2>Update your Java dependencies</h2><h3>Are there newer versions available?</h3><p>You don&#39;t want to manually check every Java dependency you have to see if newer versions are available. Luckily, there are easier ways to do this. By using plugins in your package manager you can automatically verify your dependencies as often as you’d like — in every build, for example.</p><p>Be aware that your tools might point you to beta or pre-release versions. It is highly advised that you only use stable release versions of a library.</p><h4>Maven example</h4><p>In Maven, you can use the versions plugin like below. No need to put anything specific in your pom.xml</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>mvn versions:display-dependency-updates</span></code></pre></div><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-maven-plugin" loading="lazy" width="1294" height="440" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085488%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-maven-plugin.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085488%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-maven-plugin.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h4>Gradle example</h4><p>For Gradle, we have to include a plugin like the versions plugin from ben-manes.</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>plugins {
</span><span>2</span><span>  id </span><span>&#34;com.github.ben-manes.versions&#34;</span><span> version </span><span>&#34;0.42.0&#34;</span><span>
</span><span>3</span>}</code></pre></div><p>Now we can run a similar command to display newer versions of your libraries.</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>gradle dependencyUpdates -Drevision=release</span></code></pre></div><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-project-dep-update" loading="lazy" width="1378" height="742" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085500%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-project-dep-update.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085500%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-project-dep-update.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h4>IntelliJ IDEA</h4><p>If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, then the newer versions will underline the dependencies that can be updated. This works for both Maven and Gradle projects.</p><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-group-id-pkg" loading="lazy" width="1554" height="568" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085502%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-group-id-pkg.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085502%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-group-id-pkg.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h4>Snyk</h4><p>When connecting your GitHub repository to your Snyk account, we can provide you with recommended fixes or updates at every pull request. This, in addition to our comprehensive security advice, can help you keep your Java dependencies up to date.</p><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-snyk-ui" loading="lazy" width="1824" height="1182" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085492%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-snyk-ui.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085492%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-snyk-ui.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h3>Are the packages you use still maintained?</h3><p>It is wise to revisit the GitHub repo, or mvnpackage.com, to see if there are recent updates and commits. If it looks like a package is no longer well maintained, you can choose to maintain it yourself or migrate to another,  better updated, library.</p><p>However, if you encounter a problem with a dependency that’s critical to your application, consider fixing the problem yourself and contributing that fix to the open-source project. This will be greatly appreciated — and often quicker than submitting issue reports and pushing the maintainer to fix the problem.</p><h3>Are there security issues with my Java dependencies?</h3><p>Even if your application is free from vulnerabilities now, it doesn’t mean it will stay that way forever. New vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered and disclosed on a daily bases. This means that you need to rescan your libraries regularly to ensure they remain vulnerability free.</p><p>Snyk provides you multiple ways to integrate dependency scanning in your <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/learn/secure-sdlc/">development lifecycle</a>. On your local machine you can use the <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-cli-cheat-sheet/">Snyk CLI</a>, or the integrations for IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code to scan for vulnerabilities. You can also scan during your build cycle with the Maven and Gradle (unofficial) plugin, or choose one of the CI pipeline integrations. Alternatively, you can add your Git repository to Snyk, so we can scan and update your projects for you on a daily basis.</p><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-snyk-vuln-report" loading="lazy" width="1518" height="1268" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085480%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-snyk-vuln-report.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085480%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-snyk-vuln-report.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h2>Removing Java dependencies from your project</h2><h3>Is the package still in use?</h3><p>If a Java dependency is not used anymore, we should remove it from our manifest file. Every package in that file is part of your binary and available on the classpath. Removing unused dependencies will make your binary smaller — and lead to faster startup and download times in addition to better security. Minimizing the dependencies on your classpath is critical to protecting against attacks like a <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/blog/serialization-and-deserialization-in-java/">deserialization gadget chain</a>.  </p><p>A clean desk policy — or in this case a clean app policy — is always highly advisable. Luckily, your package managers can help you with identifying these unused Java dependencies.</p><h4>Maven example</h4><p>For Maven I can use the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/analyze-mojo.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" tabindex="0">dependency plugin</a> to analyze my dependencies. This plugin checks if the Java dependencies I declare are also used in my code.</p><p>In this case, I do not want to get bothered by provided or test dependencies, so I use the ignoreNonCompile flag.</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>mvn dependency:analyze -DignoreNonCompile</span></code></pre></div><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-warning-unused" loading="lazy" width="1050" height="146" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085502%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-warning-unused.jpg&amp;w=1240&amp;q=75 1x, https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085502%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-warning-unused.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085502%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-warning-unused.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h4>Gradle example</h4><p>In Gradle we need to add another plugin to analyze dependencies. In this case, we’ll use the nebula.lint plugin. This Gradle linter can analyze the java dependencies you included and see if there are unused dependencies.</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>plugins {
</span><span>2</span><span>   id </span><span>&#34;nebula.lint&#34;</span><span> version </span><span>&#34;17.7.0&#34;</span><span>
</span><span>3</span>}</code></pre></div><p>I have to configure the plugin accordingly to set the <code>gradleLint.rules</code>. You can do this in your Gradle file, or as a command line parameter. In the example below, I choose the latter. Check the plugin <a href="https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-lint-plugin/wiki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" tabindex="0">documentation</a> for more information on how to configure this plugin for your application.</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>gradle lintGradle -PgradleLint.rules=unused-dependency</span></code></pre></div><p><img alt="wordpress-sync/blog-java-depen-lint-violation" loading="lazy" width="1464" height="482" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085502%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-lint-violation.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://snyk.io/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1663085502%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-java-depen-lint-violation.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;q=75"/></p><h2>Create a solid dependency management strategy for your Java applications</h2><p>When developing Java applications and using dependencies like libraries or frameworks, it’s wise to create a strategy for how to handle them. Knowing how to select, update, and remove java dependencies from our application is essential for security. By creating a clear strategy, we prevent surprises when a high priority security issue requires us to update a package.</p><p>Check out <a tabindex="0" href="https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/software-dependencies/">this article to learn more about managing open source dependencies</a>.</p></div></div>
