		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Often when an organization is going through some turmoil, executives think to themselves, “Ah, I should have some one-on-ones with the team so they can hear how we’re handling this.” On the other side, I frequently hear from folks who get nervous when they get these meeting invites, “The CEO/CTO/CPO/etc just scheduled a one-on-one with me! What am I supposed to talk to them about?” There’s no universal guide to this, but you can usually categorize these meetings into a small taxonomy of meetings, so here are a few notes on each variety and some general advice.</p><h2 id="general-advice">General Advice</h2><p>Before surveying the taxonomy of executive one-on-ones, some high-level advice:</p><ul><li>If you’re not sure what’s happening, let the executive take the lead</li><li>Try to figure out why the meeting is happening before you’re in the meeting. It’s much easier to prepare if you understand why it’s happening</li><li>Know that the executive will very likely have an agenda, but sometimes have no agenda at all, in which case it’s very helpful to have prepared ahead of time</li><li>You <em>can</em> influence their minds by asking good questions and by suggesting specific approaches with your rationale behind them</li><li>Good executives are able to effectively engage with your ideas/concerns/criticisms even if you phrase them poorly or deliver them with anger. That said, many executives are <em>not</em> able to hear issues raised in anger or with frustration. Even if you have good reason to be angry, it will usually undermine your point or get you categorized as “unconstructive” rather than effecting positive change</li><li><a href="https://lethain.com/present-to-executives/">The advice on presenting to executives</a> applies here as well</li></ul><h2 id="fact-finding">Fact Finding</h2><p>The Fact Finding meeting is when an executive is trying to dig into something, usually a big opportunity or a big screw up, and they want to understand your perspective. There may be significant conflict with an organization. There may be a project that’s once again slipped by two months. There may be a recurring source of production incidents. Whatever it is, the executive has decided to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>In these meetings your most obvious goal is to answer the questions you get. You have two more subtle goals as well. First, you should try to fix their mental model if it’s leading them astray. For example, they might view a team you work with as underperforming, unaware that another team has consistently blocked their progress by changing the deliverable shortly before release.</p><p>Second, you should avoid unnecessarily inserting yourself into whatever problem they’re trying to debug. You may be asked to render judgment on peers, coworkers, a technology problem or whatever, and share your honest opinion, but don’t manufacture an opinion to share. Also try to be kind: my rule in this situations is to always assume what I say will be inadvertently shared with the person who it’s about.</p><h2 id="loyalty-check">Loyalty Check</h2><p>The Loyalty Check meeting is an executive wanting to meet with you to determine if you’re bought into either a specific initiative or sometimes just bought into <em>them</em>. Generally these don’t happen at well-run companies, and I’d prefer to live in a world where this sort of meeting doesn’t exist, but I’ve experienced and heard of it too frequently to ignore it.</p><p>The executive’s goal in this meeting is to prevent interference with their current goal. Your goal with this meeting is to understand their plan, and to avoid coming across as an impediment. By the time an executive moves into loyalty checking mode, their plan is in flight to the best of their ability, so it’s rarely helpful to push back on the initiative. Instead, try to understand their perspective, and feel free to suggest nuance to how they approach their goal.</p><p>If you suddenly find yourself in one of these and aren’t sure what to do, ask open-ended, constructive questions until you run out of time.</p><h2 id="meet-and-greet">Meet and Greet</h2><p>The Meet and Greet meeting is a relationship building meeting without a well-defined goal. If you’re most comfortable with transactional meetings, this meeting will feel very alien because it has no transactional goal. Let the executive steer the session, and avoid the temptation to steer it towards a more tangible goal. Earlier in my career I found these meetings quite unnatural, but I’ve come to appreciate them more over time: it’s much harder to get stuck in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle">the drama triangle</a> when you know the other people involved as humans rather than business archetypes.</p><p>If you’re nervous about this kind of meeting, prepare an unreasonably large number of general questions and ask away. The executive is trying to get to know you, so it’s fine to bring open ended questions about their career, family, hobbies or whatever you’d find interesting.</p><h2 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h2><p>You’ll sometimes find yourself assigned an executive mentor. You may be confused about what will happen during the mentorship session. More awkwardly, in many cases the executive you’re assigned to has been told to “host a mentorship session” and doesn’t really have a clear goal for the sessions either. Some executives will also be delightfully prepared with good questions, but you’ll only know which you’re heading into after you show up.</p><p>To avoid the session turning into a meet and greet, come prepared with focus areas and questions. In almost all cases, folks who get a lot from non-peer mentors are diligent at preparing and extracting that value from them. Relying on your mentor to structure the relationship will usually end in a dormant relationship after one to three meetings.</p><p>The best way to develop focus areas is to spend a few minutes studying your mentor’s background, identify areas where you’d also like to accomplish something that they’ve already done, and develop questions digging into that. How did you get your first functional leadership role? What do you wish you’d done before managing managers to be better prepared for that role? Should I spend time developing as a mentor to move into a staff engineer role? And so on.</p><h2 id="skip-level-meeting">Skip-level meeting</h2><p>Underneath the hood, skip-level meetings are really a fact finding, meet and greet, or mentorship session. If you’ve never met the executive before, then it’s almost certainly a meet and greet, and otherwise you probably won’t know if it’s a fact finding or mentorship session until after it’s started. Prepare for a mentorship session, and save the notes for the next session if it happens to turn into a fact finding session.</p><hr/><p>And with that, best of luck in your next executive one-on-one.</p></div></div>

I was happy he agreed to share his story about being a leader while navigating follicular lymphoma (a still incurable canc</span></em><span>er). </span><em>We also talked about why he went into management (despite swearing he never wanted to do it), his transition into leadership, and what keeps him up at night.</em></p><p>(laughs) A long time ago, while in college in the late &#39;90s, I got involved with this project called Jabber which was pretty exciting. Like a lot of Open Source projects at the time, we hung out in an IRC room to work on the protocol. I tried to join IRC with handles like DSmith or DSmith55 or DaveSmith, but they were all taken. So, I wound up joining as DizzyD. I don&#39;t quite know where I got that from at the time, but I thought it sounded cool.</p><p>We worked remotely for a year on this thing before we finally met up in Denver, and when we met in person, people were like, &#34;You&#39;re not David, you&#39;re Dizzy.&#34; It occurred to me that this disambiguation could solve a lot of problems! There were always four or five Davids in the office – at CenturyLink there were 70 or 80 of us! Anyway, Dizzy just became my handle and I&#39;ve used it ever since, because it&#39;s easier for people to remember, there are a lot of Dave Smiths in the world and I just feel a little more special.</p><p>Totally. It happens.</p><p>Yeah. My first name&#39;s David. It drives my parents a little crazy because my mom is like, &#34;I named you David for a reason.&#34; I don&#39;t know, you have to become your own person, I guess. But they&#39;re the only people that call me David anymore. Even my wife calls me Dizzy at this point.</p><p>My name is Dizzy Smith. I’ve been around technology for almost 26 years now, which is hard to believe! I was VP of Engineering at DigitalOcean for a bit, then a company called Packet (acquired by Equinix) and more recently Edge &amp; Node. But I&#39;ve worked on all sorts of different things over the years. The first 15 years of my career were mostly writing code. I worked on Jabber, I helped write PingFederate for Ping Identity, built distributed databases in Erlang, etc. I did a lot of other random stuff as well, and then eventually went into the management track.</p><p>Yeah. I had been an engineer for about 15 years before I decided to go into management and I joined a company called Basho to work on a distributed database called Riak. When I joined the company, I was certain that I never wanted to manage people, because people are non-deterministic, they&#39;re hard to predict. There are just a lot of feelings when you deal with people! I wanted to write code; that was my happy place. About three or four months after I joined the company, I noticed that I had two lumps on the back of my neck. I went to the doctor and they started feeling around and then they just went white as a sheet and it turns out I had stage four follicular lymphoma. It was pretty shocking, especially when you&#39;re in your early 30s because you still have that taste of immortality on your lips.</p><p>At that age, I still had that &#34;I&#39;m going to live forever,&#34; kind of feeling. Ultimately, though, what the doctor said was, &#34;Look, we discovered this so late that we can sort of keep it in check for probably about 20 years with current medicine, but it&#39;s going to keep coming back and we&#39;re going to eventually run out of options for dealing with it, and then…that&#39;s the end.&#34; So I did chemo and that got me into remission pretty quick because the drugs are effective on the first pass. They&#39;re just not a cure. In that whole process of doing chemo, you really confront your mortality. There are days when, frankly, you wonder if you’re going to make it.</p><p>On reflection, I realized that I loved writing code and was moderately good at it, but that wasn&#39;t really the most fulfilling part of the work I did. The most satisfying parts of my career up to that point had been coaching and mentoring and leading teams, although I&#39;d never managed people. So, I thought that I’d give management a try, with the belief that I could do better than some of the bosses I’d had up to that point. I had been in a number of rough environments; I wanted to give it a try and invest in people.</p><p>When you&#39;re faced with the prospect of death, the question becomes, “If there&#39;s a memorial service for me, what is it I want people saying? How will I be satisfied that I have lived my life fully if people show up and say this thing?” I realized that for me, that thing was, “Did he invest in me? Did he help me do something amazing?” In addition, I know there&#39;s a limit to the things that I can do on my own. There is no limit, however, to my ability to encourage and inspire and do what I can to uplift other people who are way smarter than me and far more capable. That&#39;s something I can do and make the world a little bit better.</p><p>That&#39;s how I got into management. When I came out of chemo, they were looking for an engineering manager. They had five engineers. I was one of them. I was like, &#34;You know what? I want to give that a try.&#34;</p><p>Oh yeah, yeah. There are a lot of illnesses and cancers that once you get five years out, you&#39;re considered cured because the odds for relapse are very low. That is not the case for my particular kind of lymphoma, which is still considered incurable. Although I just had an experimental treatment last summer that maybe, fingers crossed, could be a cure – but we just don’t know yet.</p><p><em>(we both cross our fingers) </em></p><p>I spent a lot of time talking to my therapist about this. They give you an oncology-specific therapist at the hospital these days. One of the things that I&#39;ve talked to him about is, that I&#39;ll be fine for a couple of months or even a couple of years, and then it comes crashing back down. It&#39;s a thing you always think about because you know that it&#39;s going to come back. It&#39;s just the way it works and it&#39;s really hard.</p><p>I mean, I would categorize what I&#39;m going through right now as pretty much a chronic thing. There&#39;s definitely a time limit; we don&#39;t know what it is, but it&#39;s far enough out right now that it&#39;s chronic. Does it get tiring to think of death? Yes, it does. But to your point, it can be a catalyst, a source of energy as well. It kind of depends on the day, honestly.</p><p>I think the parallels of leadership are very similar. There are days as a leader where you are run down and you encounter problem after problem and the weight of it simply crushes you. Then there are other days where you run into problems and you&#39;re just batting them off and you&#39;re doing your thing. And it&#39;s great. I think they&#39;re very similar sorts of sets of feelings.</p><p>Yeah. So, I took on the engineering manager role. Now, to keep it in perspective, when I took on that role, that was the entire engineering team for the company. There weren&#39;t a lot of people in the company, I think, 12 or something altogether across all the functions. I took on that role and the first thing they told me was, “We need you to double the size of this team in the next six months.” And I&#39;d never hired anyone before. So I had to sort of discover a lot of this stuff myself. Figure out how to interview people, which is a whole other fun topic, and so forth.</p><p>Over the course of about 18 months when I came back from chemo, I eventually wound up becoming the VP of Engineering. I was responsible for not just engineering, which became about 30 people, but also professional services and support. There were about 90 people altogether in that group by the time I left Basho. Now, Basho&#39;s complicated for me personally – it’s a source of both pride and shame. I had never created a team or created a culture or anything like that before. I just tried stuff, I tried to treat everything as an experiment and do something, learned from it, and do something else kind of thing. We hired some amazing people, but I also inadvertently created a homogenous, white guy culture.</p><p><span>I told myself that I was trying to create a diverse environment, but I wasn&#39;t really. Now as it turns out my wife, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo" rel="">Sarah Drasner</a><span>, also worked there – one of my last days at the company was one of her first days there. So we sort of passed like ships in the night. She was a front-end engineering manager working on other parts of the product. She wound up having the interface with some of the people that I hired and it was terrible. The engineering culture was hostile to women.</span></p><p>When we started dating, five or six years later, we had some hard discussions about that when we started dating, because in my mind at that point Basho had been my shining achievement. I had started from a tiny team, hired a bunch of people and built teams and features. From her perspective, it was a sort of trash fire to work there because some of the people – not all the people – but some of the people were just awful. All the things we clearly identify as hostile and homogenous culture she had to deal with.</p><p>That set of conversations forced me to rethink what it was I did as a leader at that place. Now I look back on it and I&#39;m proud of some of the work I did, but also recognize how naive and ignorant I was about some really important topics. I also understand in a significant way just how critical it is to get some of this cultural and diversity stuff right; you can really injure people as a leader if you&#39;re not paying attention. For me, Basho was a great experience. I learned a lot. I also messed up a lot and it set the tone for things that I would learn as I continued my leadership journey.</p><p>I had no training. I didn&#39;t really have any mentors. I didn&#39;t have any of that stuff. As I&#39;ve worked at other places, I&#39;ve really tried to pay attention to making sure that we&#39;re coaching managers and giving them good guidance and support. But no, I didn&#39;t have any of that.</p><p>I think that it is really important to note that, yes, it was inadvertent, but that doesn’t absolve me of responsibility. It took me a while to come to grips with my failures here. It was my responsibility to create a safe and diverse environment and I didn’t do that.</p><p>Yeah. Mine is to create environments where people can do the best work of their lives. That was a thing that evolved for me sort of over a series of leadership roles. I knew I wanted to do that at Basho - I did my best - but I really messed some stuff up in the process! I kept refining it as I went on in my career and trying to make it better and better. I think a big role of leadership and managers is about creating environments. We&#39;re not there to tell people exactly how to go do a thing or micromanage them. We&#39;re there to create the environment, so they have the clarity of vision and everything they need to do great things. It&#39;s about amplifying.</p><p>I mean, it was five or six years. One of the things in my experience, now doing this almost 12 years, is that when you become a manager when you move into the manager track from the individual contributor track, one of the first things you run into is that your feedback loop becomes much longer, very quickly. If you&#39;re an engineer writing code or whatever, your feedback loop is typically a couple of hours to a couple of days. You&#39;ll know if you messed up if you made a bad decision, there are things that are longer range, but a lot of times, you know pretty quickly. When you move from an individual contributor to a manager role, your feedback loop goes from a couple of hours to a couple of weeks, maybe a month.</p><p>When that happens, you feel like the world has dropped out from under you. It&#39;s like you&#39;re in space all of a sudden, you have no feedback for when you move or what&#39;s going on, and it makes it much harder to learn. So when you become a director, a manager of managers, feedback goes three to six months, a VP can be years before you&#39;re going to know definitively! So it&#39;s not surprising to me, in hindsight, that it took me so long to realize how much I had messed up. It&#39;s just a part of that learning curve for management.</p><p>Yeah. I think this is why people who are managers often say, &#34;I just don&#39;t know what I got done today&#34; because what they got done today was they made a decision in the meeting. They clarified communication between a group. They did things that you can&#39;t see the immediate impact of. It&#39;s a part of what makes management or leadership of any kind really difficult because you just don&#39;t have that. I agree that you can create those feedback loops and we try to, but there&#39;s also the aspect that when you’re coaching a person, seeing that change can take a long time sometimes because they have to integrate it, they have to agree with it. There is a lot of acceptance that has to happen there - most of which you don’t control.</p><p>Yeah. It&#39;s the thing that wakes you up in the middle of the night. You wake up just out of a dead sleep and you&#39;re like, &#34;Well, maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said that to that person. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have made that decision.&#34; There&#39;s always these things that pop up and we&#39;re like, &#34;Oh yeah, maybe that was a mistake.&#34; And it can literally be years later.</p><p>That was just before I went to DigitalOcean. So, I was at CenturyLink. I was at a company called Orchestrate, which was a little startup, like ten people or something like that, but got acquired by CenturyLink. I was there for like six months or something, but Orchestrate was where I was at when Sarah and I started dating and we were working through a lot of these topics.</p><p>Yeah, it was when I went into DigitalOcean (DO). At the time and this was what, six years ago now, something like that. Keeping track of time gets weird as we get older. But when I went into DO, it had a reputation for being “Digital Bro-cean”, which was not great. The team that I took on had 20 people on it, and there was only one woman. There just wasn&#39;t a lot of diversity on that team. I went in there knowing that I want to do better at this, I want to create a diverse and vibrant culture where people do the best work of their lives. That was my mission when I went into DO, and we did it. By the time I left our engineering management team was fully gender-balanced. There were only two white guys on that management team of ten or so. At an individual contributor level, we were up to 40% underrepresented people, with a substantial portion (30%) being women. But it took three and a half years to get to that point! It was a really heavy lift over time in addition to all your normal startup stuff. But I went in intentionally trying to do that because I wanted to atone (if that’s the right word) – I wanted to do the right thing by people. Basho still weighs heavily on me for the sort of environment that I inadvertently created. I wanted to do better.</p><p>I left DigitalOcean, I guess, at the beginning of 2019. I took a six-month sabbatical because DigitalOcean was rough. It was not an easy environment. There was a lot of turmoil over the years, but they&#39;ve gotten to a much better place now, which as a stockholder, I&#39;m super happy about. But at that time, it was a startup that was growing up and so I wound up taking six months afterwards because the thing I realized is that it&#39;s really important as a leader to have some time between things. Otherwise what happens is you wind up taking all your fear and trauma from the previous environment with you into the next thing. Then you can wind up overlaying models from the previous environments on the people in the new environment – and they don’t always match up.</p><p>So, I deliberately took some time off to try and recover and rest a little bit. It was great, I took the kids to the pool almost every day. I played Xbox. It was a great time to recover from the burdens of leadership. I think people don&#39;t quite understand the emotional toll that leadership takes. If you&#39;re doing it well, if you&#39;re caring about people, it is not a minor thing, you&#39;re giving of yourself, your emotional energy. At the end of the day, a big part of the reason why I&#39;m not a believer in having managers and directors write code is because there’s just no emotional energy left to write code. That part of my brain just doesn’t work after I’ve finished a day of management.</p><p>That six months were very healing for me. And then I popped my head up and started looking around and I had looked at Packet&#39;s website before, because I wanted to go build another cloud, working on a cloud at DigitalOcean was a ton of fun, really hard, and interesting problems. I wanted to do it again and see if I could do it any better.</p><p>Packet was building a bare-metal cloud, but they had no roles available and I really wanted to be VP of Engineering. So I was talking to recruiters and stuff, and then the day after I popped my head up, a recruiter reached out to me and he&#39;s like, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m looking for a VP of Engineering at Packet.&#34; my response was pretty much, &#34;Yes, sign me up.&#34; So I went through the interview process and I remember going to New York for the final set of interviews with Zach — who you also interviewed and Jacob — and we were walking to the train together and at the end of the day and I turned to him and I was just like, &#34;Look, I really hope you&#39;ll hire me. I know this is a bad negotiating tactic. But after talking with the people here, I want to be a part of this, and I think that we could do amazing things together.&#34; He looked a little surprised because I think normally, you&#39;re not supposed to say that, you&#39;re supposed to be a little cool and such, but I&#39;m not really a cool person. That explains it.</p><p>So I went to Packet. Packet was kind of similar to DO. They had a working product and they wanted to expand it and the team size was similar to when I went into DO, the engineering team was about 20 people. I was there for, I guess, three or four months when Zach pulled the VPs aside and told us that Equinix was acquiring us. We went through the whole due diligence thing, and eventually landed inside Equinix, in March of 2020. The deal closed the day before everything really started to shut down from the pandemic. So, I was very happy with the timing of that.</p><p>Yeah. The deal closed, the pandemic hit, and then two weeks later, I found out that I had relapsed for the third time. Getting acquired is a whole thing – it is a very high-stress time because you&#39;re getting pulled into an organization that already exists. Equinix in particular was very complex.</p><p>It was very stressful, and then to have the relapse at that point just compounded everything. The thing is, all of the treatments I do for my kind of cancer affect my immune system – since the cancer is in the immune system. When the pandemic hit, the doctor said, &#34;We don&#39;t want to treat you right now, even though you&#39;re relapsing because we don&#39;t know when there&#39;s going to be a vaccine for COVID. We don&#39;t even know how to treat it, and we don&#39;t want to knock down your immune system and increase your risk,&#34; because ... Anyway, you can guess sort of all the reasons there. But it was super duper stressful.</p><p>Yeah. I mean, there&#39;s just a lot of changing of gears, learning the new culture. There&#39;s just so much that goes into it that&#39;s really tough and unpredictable.</p><p>Well, when I had the appointments and tests, I wound up taking a week off or something. I didn&#39;t deal with it well. There was too much going on; there were too many changes at the same time! This was also the time when schools shut down. Then we were – Sarah and I – we&#39;d get off of work at night and do another five hours of homework with the kids. It was a crazy time. So I can&#39;t say that I had a great process for all of this. I was very not zen about it. I was just trying to keep my head up above water.</p><p>I wish I could say that after dealing with this for 10 years, I figured it out, but I think it&#39;s like the monster in the closet that periodically comes out, and you&#39;re just like, &#34;Leave me alone!&#34; I didn’t want to deal with cancer right then, because I was trying to be there for people. Especially at this time, everybody in the world was going through these really hard transitions. There were a lot of people who were suddenly working remotely, but they were not used to it. A lot of companies, Equinix being one of them, just Zoomed everybody to death. And it wasn&#39;t just Equinix that did that, from what I heard, most companies had that problem. Nobody knew how to transition from a very synchronous culture in-person to a very async, remote culture. So what most organizations did was port the synchronicity into Zoom.</p><p>Everybody was going through a lot of stuff and it was tough to be there for people and support them and hold the organization together and also deal with all the normal acquisition stuff. It was just a lot. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a secret to it beyond paying attention to how you&#39;re feeling. I think this is probably one of the most important leadership lessons: the first person you have to manage is yourself.</p><p>When the relapse happened, and the doctors told me they were going to just do watch-and-wait, it was hard to manage myself. We wound up doing radiation later in 2020, but that didn&#39;t really have the effect that they wanted because I&#39;d done radiation a couple of years before, while at DO. Eventually in 2021, I was able to do an experimental treatment that was pretty significant. When I did do that, I actually took medical leave, which turned out to be one of the best things I could possibly do.</p><p>I think that reinforced for me the importance of planning for succession, planning for the org to run without me. Happily, my team at Equinix was set up in a way that allowed me to take a leave. That was the first time I&#39;d ever had a full medical leave for cancer treatment. Being able to do that, because I had a great management staff in place was fantastic – and they did amazing stuff! I mean, I would argue they did better with me gone. So, that was great because I was able to really rest and recover.</p><p>About four months? Just the mental aspect of gearing up for treatment, it was an experimental treatment, so we had to drive 20 miles to the hospital every day for two months because you had to get your blood tested every day. They eventually admitted me for a couple of days and so forth and so on. So, it was a whole thing.</p><p>Yeah. That was dumb. You should take medical leave when you have a serious illness. I have been very adamant with my managers and directors thereafter. I was having a conversation the other day with someone I&#39;m coaching and they were talking about, &#34;I know I need to take a sabbatical, but I&#39;m going to defer because I want to wait for this other person to get back from their thing.&#34; And I&#39;m like, &#34;No, you&#39;ve been doing this for a long time. It doesn&#39;t sound like your company&#39;s in a situation where they&#39;re going to keel over if you take some time off, but you’ve got to do it because if you don&#39;t, you can&#39;t be there for the people you&#39;re leading and you&#39;re managing.&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s a heavy responsibility that you bear when you&#39;re responsible for people and taking care of them. If you can&#39;t be there for them, you&#39;ve got to do what you need to do to take care of yourself so you can be there for them.</p><p>I think that&#39;s just kind of the person I am about some of this stuff. I do think that there&#39;s an aspect of a vulnerability that serves us well as leaders. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that leaders should have it all together all the time. But the truth of the matter is that leaders are people and sometimes we don’t have it altogether, just like any other person on the planet.</p><p>You can go fix them, which is a big part of your role as a leader. I think being vulnerable also creates room for other people to also be vulnerable. If, as a leader, as a manager, you can admit that it was a hard day or that you made the wrong decision, that creates room for other people in your organization and other organizations you work with to also do that. The funny thing about admitting you&#39;re wrong or admitting you&#39;re overwhelmed is that it creates opportunities for learning and excellence.</p><p>If you&#39;re not vulnerable, if you&#39;re not open about this stuff, there&#39;s no reason to learn. There&#39;s no motivation there because you&#39;ve never done anything wrong. It&#39;s something I do try to cultivate and I&#39;ve found over the years that it&#39;s better to just be upfront when it&#39;s hard. There&#39;s a balancing act there, you don&#39;t want to constantly be like, &#34;I&#39;m broken all the time.” Leaders do need a certain level of confidence and willingness to to get up in the morning and face the scary things. But I think there&#39;s also room for softness and vulnerability. The best leaders that I&#39;ve worked with are willing to be humbled.</p><p><span>I would just remind people that there’s no handbook for leadership. Although my wife is writing a management book (</span><a href="https://www.engmanagement.dev/" rel="">Engineering Management for the Rest of Us</a><span>!) and I think she&#39;s captured some really seminal and amazing stuff. She&#39;s running core web infrastructure at Google, so you know she&#39;s a badass engineering leader. But that aside, there just aren&#39;t books out there that are going to teach you necessarily how to interact with all the different kinds of people or how to do all those things leadership requires. I would encourage people who are leaders to be sober about the responsibility they carry. It&#39;s not just about telling people what to do. You are responsible for the well-being of those people, and you should treat it as the critical task that it is. I wish someone had told me that. You learn it the hard way though, I guess.</span></p><p><em>If this piece resonated with you, please let me know and give the heart button below a tap.</em></p></div></article></div></div>

We saw the country (US). Fast forward 7 years and we are now building our own house paycheck to paycheck. It&#39;s a beautiful property. I know there are people on here that have much, much more and could afford to buy an already existing house. But my dreams are to have a different kind of life, so in that sense I am definitely living that. Yes there are mornings I wish I can wake up and NOT want to install my own well pump, install mini splits in 105 degree weather, install siding, dig foundations, run 40 80-pound bags of cement in a mixer, 2 at a time. etc etc etc...<p>But my alternative life would have been spending the last 7 years playing new versions of Call of Duty and kinda pissing time away.

Because such a feat is not really possible for everyone to do, less people do it so less congestion and you can make it enjoyable.

Worse, with games it’s too easy to get sucked into a thread that keeps me up well past bedtime, in which case I’m more tired then next day, not less.</p><p>Other hobbies accumulate progress, and are sometimes more open to participation by friends and family.

Life is a series of bricks, placed day by day, to build the foundation of life.<p>I’d take it one step further and say life also has compounding returns. What you invest today yields returns tomorrow. Not all hobbies yield the same returns.</p><p>Gaming as a hobby offers a flat return. The time you put in is the time you get out. There is no progress outside the bounds of the game (except for some fuzzier returns about societal commentaries and personal growth on par with the returns on a fantasy novel - or the future returns of making a game yourself).</p><p>The returns of a hobby like glass blowing is the improved ability to create on the other side of engaging in the hobby. Every piece you make sets the stage for the next piece. It’s a compounding return where the investment you make today is part of the return you get out of tomorrow’s investment.</p><p>I still play games, watch TV, and read fiction. But I no longer engage with them the way I used to. Now I engage with hobbies that yield compounding returns because tomorrow’s happiness is just as important as today’s.

What does it mean to &#39;produce&#39;?  To transform something that doesn&#39;t have value into something that does have value?  Value to whom?  The output of the majority of hobbyists&#39; work has no value to anyone but themselves, and if it has no value to anyone but the creator, it&#39;s just consumption with extra steps.  And if it has financial value to other people, that&#39;s not hobby, that&#39;s a second job.<p>There&#39;s a reason why most artistic pursuits are either completely nonviable as a profession or are a lottery where the top 0.01% become superstars and the rest barely break even or lose money.  When the thing one &#39;produces&#39; is something people will do for fun, supply massively outstrips demand, and more entries into the hobby doesn&#39;t produce more valuable items, it produces more tat that nobody wants.

This leads to people playing the games long after they&#39;ve stopped having fun, and only quitting when they realise they&#39;ve not been having fun for months, possibly years.<p>But this isn&#39;t a problem specific to games; this is a problem with predatory marketing.

When you&#39;re gaming, you&#39;re having fun and enjoying your life <i>in the moment</i>. It&#39;s only afterward when you start the cycle of criticizing yourself for not doing something &#34;productive&#34; with that time that the negative feelings enter. In fact, the whole exercise of feeling bad about yourself for playing a fun game and relaxing is exactly PART of the problem Seneca talks about - unless your gaming habits cause you to destroy your links to other important sources of joy and health, you shouldn&#39;t feel bad about having a fun &#34;pastime&#34; activity, that is just as valid as keeping a garden or reading a good book of fiction.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Online games with total strangers can be challenging and fun, but also a blur. I&#39;ve spent way too much time playing Rocket League for example and my experience in hindsight would have been the same off I had only played for like 5-10 hours. And then there are pretend-work games like Factorio, Kerbal Space Program or even more obvious Zachtronic games like Shenzhen IO.

&gt; Novels, while being ficitonal, allow you to explore inner worlds of other people and complex interactions between them (and there&#39;s nothing more complex in the universe and at the same important to us than humans and interactions between them)
How do you even argue with that? Can you somehow support this claim?
Though from reasoning like this i can deduce that you must hate House of Leaves, and kinda understand why you dislike Nier Automata.

Now I get to pick up what&#39;s left over and make the best out of it.<p>I really wish I had started with it when I was in my 20s, ideally as an early teenager or even kid, when breaking some bones is not something which keeps you concerned for many weeks.</p><p>I wish I could drive into the alps and ride the trails, but I&#39;m currently &#34;recovering&#34; from a crash which ripped a tendon. In quotes because it can&#39;t really be fixed and I have to see if the system is still usable enough. But it is enough for having a lot of fun outside.</p><p>Today at 17:00 I was completely tired laying in my bed after watching hours of a TV series, half asleep and feeling badly rested, was struggling to motivate me to ride. But at 18:00 I pulled myself up and went, and I had a blast during those 1:30 hours, was even making screams of joy (I ride alone, so it&#39;s no show, but a feedback expression to myself). I was congratulating me for making the decision to go and ride, had super beautiful views of the nature at wonderful 27°C (80°F). Dry but planted fields, juicy green forests, sounds of birds and insects, breathable, clean air, warm wind being felt by the hairs on the legs and arms, what an experience.</p><p>I have a lavalier mic attached to my backpack&#39;s breast strap and an app where I can press record, to record notes of 1 minute length. I will quote you one of the recordings from today:</p><p>rec60s--1656265743723--19-49-03.q128.mp3: &#34;Well, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you that you overcame yourself to then get up, go out and ride the bike, because it was really, really nice! Thank you very much! It was good, it was worth it, you have to do this, always, always. Always force you to do this. Regardless of how weary, how tired, how uninspired, you rode extra. Extra, because it was so nice. Other ways, new ways, new trails&#34;</p><p>With &#34;extra&#34; I meant that I had initially decided to ride my minimum of 23 km in a relatively dull track which I know I will be able to complete under any circumstances (except when I have migraine), but then decided to leave the asphalt, ride up a hill through a forest into some fields, where I then took this photo.</p><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/HGQ55kQ" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/HGQ55kQ</a></p><p>Maybe I&#39;m a psycho for talking to me like that, but I know that I switch contexts very hard so that I&#39;m a different person when I do different things and tend to forget the experiences. So this was a &#34;thank you&#34; and reminder from the biking me to the baseline me. Usually I only record new ideas or things I get reminded of which I forgot.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t really sure if I was going to ride today, I didn&#39;t yesterday, because I rode so hard and long distances last week that by butt was really hurting, and no amount deer tallow cream (Xenofit Second Skin) seemed to be helping. But it turned out that I had zero issues with it today.</p><p>Most of the riding time is a relatively hard exercise with heavy breathing and lots of sweating. No video game will ever be a replacement for such a thing.</p><p>But I know that I very likely already have my best years behind me (and lost them to a screen).

Perhaps the OP doesn&#39;t think playing COD is a great way to pass the time -- but video games are certainly not a waste of your life if you really enjoy them. This applies to any hobby.</p><p>Ultimately we have a short time here and it&#39;s up to us personally to decide what is a waste of our time and then act accordingly. Judgement on these efforts is hardly effective. RVing with my wife sounds like an incredibly suffocating experience -- trapped with another person in such a small space -- akin to buying a boat and spending 3 years &#34;sailing&#34;, without seeing land for many days on end -- just figuring out what to do with the day when you wake up. But some people yearn for it, and that&#39;s great.

It&#39;s not cheap to park a RV anywhere.  Pretty much every road is off limits to overnight parking.  Those fines are very pricy too.  (Watch Something about Schmidt.)</p><p>2.  Living out of an RV is a pain.  Stuff breaks down, and I don&#39;t know of one public street, or parking lot, that allows the owner to repair their disabled vechicle.</p><p>3.  They get horrid gas mileage, and their are state/federal taxes on gas.  Registration, Insurance.  Plus because they are on the road, they are more likely to get one of those ever increasing traffic tickets.  A parking ticket in SF is 80.00.  Crazy!  (Neusome has a bill on his desk that would do away with late fees on parking tickets.  I hope he signs it.)</p><p>4.  RV-ing is fine, but they pay in indirect ways.</p><p>5.  I worked with a guy who tried to live cheap in a small camper truck.  Every other night he would get a knock, and flashlight shined into his eyes.  It was always, &#34;move along, or I will ticket you!&#34;.  He tried the shower thing at 24 hour Whatever gym.  Once the manager figured he was just using the showers, he was told he needed to workout.  (Yea--I can&#39;t believe how petty some people are.). We worked construction, and the last thing he needed was a workout before 7:00 am.</p><p>Another guy I knew tried the RV lifestyle.  He too was harrsssed by cops.  Cops would tell him straight up he was not breaking any laws, but if he didn&#39;t move along he would get another ticket.  Oh yea, the next sentance I&#39;m about to write still gets my blood pressure up.  One night my friend was sound asleep on a rural county road.  He tried to hide.  He knew the drill.  He did have a 25 lb dog.  This cop pounded on the side of his camper.  He opened the door, and the dog growled.  The officer took out his side arm and shot the dog.  I have so little respect for some of these cops.</p><p>The last time I looked at what it would cost to park/sleep in a private RV park it was $79 a night.</p><p>This is in the Bay Area though.</p><p>Their is a pilot program in the Bay Area for low income RV&#39;ers.  I believe it&#39;s near the bay?  It basically a lot that RV&#39;ers can park for free.  It&#39;s only available to county residents though.</p><p>My point is uless you have money, that whole RV lifestyle can be a nightmare.</p><p>Walmart used to let RVers park overnight.  I have a feeling that privilege is gone.  America the great?  Our biggest concern is finding a place to sleep.</p><p>Off topic, but the one thing Russia did well under Communism is build apartments.

Provide us with worlds we cannot even imagine, infinite explorations?</p><p>Or will AI be used as an excuse to avoid employing expensive and risky human imagination? Instead push everything to a bland middle-ground,  lowest common denominator based on the safest and most profitable options determined from the training set...</p><p>We&#39;re already there, considering most games people play are some kind of optimized hyper-addictive candy crush with guns.</p><p>Sure, I can imagine a new Elder Scrolls installment where each npc was actually unique, with meaningful interactivity possible with every contact. Where every side quest is challenging, interesting, and fills out the story universe with depth.</p><p>But will we actually get that? Technology tends to be used to increase breadth rather than depth. Quantity, rather than quality. What we&#39;ll get is more of the same, Skyrims with ever bigger and more realistic (but not deeper) worlds, optimized to find the cheapest and easiest way to keep you subscribing.

I decided decades ago that I didn&#39;t want to work five days a week taking two vacations a year for 20-30 years and then retire comfortably.<p>Every few years, I take a lot of time off. Months, sometimes over a year. If I plan well, I have money saved and I travel. Every time I do this, it sets me back financially; sometimes I&#39;m completely broke before I start working again. I&#39;d be well-served to balance it a little better, and only blow half my savings before going back to the grind. It&#39;s not easy for me to find that balance, and sometimes it&#39;s a real struggle.</p><p>I have a knack for poor timing (left a job right before the 2001 dotcom crash, left a job right before the 2008 recession, and left my latest job just now, when there appears to be a recession looming). I&#39;m about to set off on a months-long RV trip, and for once I expect to have a decent amount of savings left at the end, and plan on buying a house some time next year. While I like my itinerant lifestyle, it&#39;s time to secure a base of operations, too. Something modest, so that it won&#39;t prevent me from doing another trip like this in a few years.</p><p>It&#39;s not for everyone; I get that. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a better lifestyle than working hard and retiring in comfort. It&#39;s better for me, though.</p><p>You&#39;re only your current age once. If you wait until you&#39;re old, you won&#39;t have the same experiences. I&#39;m not willing to deny myself these moments along the way in return for a potential future payoff. So many people die before they get to enjoy the fruits of their labor. It&#39;s possible to work full-time and simultaneously live a fulfilling life; I see plenty of people do it. I don&#39;t know where they get the energy, though; all I can manage while working is TV, video games, and infrequent weekend activities. Most of the time I feel like all I do is work.

I have three children (4-9yo) and take them out of school now and then to do trips from a week up to three months.

I carried text books in my luggage.<p>It is certainly harder and unless home schooling you want a home base/school, but you definitely don&#39;t need to be anchored to just school holiday periods. In our area, you file for a school exemption which is reviewed by the principal and, unless your child is lagging, they seem to approve it easily enough. You can find out what they&#39;ll miss in class and take materials along for the kids to do as activities.</p><p>Our holidays are more adventurous than sitting around a pool (usually roadtrips/hiking/camping) and we constantly talk about what&#39;s around us, so holidays are very educational and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m letting the kids down long-term by pulling them out of school now and then.</p><p>Doing more than that though might be disruptive or difficult. You&#39;d need to be travelling prior to school age, home schooling (adds extra workload for the parents) or switching schools/curricula frequently. I know home schooling is not entirely uncommon, but I think there&#39;d be inevitable sacrifices if you were juggling that on top of work and travel.

It doesn&#39;t dent the content/happiness part a slightest bit.</p><p>Also numerous side effects - one starts eating healthier. Any kind of gaming addiction I had before was cured too, now its just waste of life that repulses me (not making critique - if that&#39;s your real kick I guess go for it, but I can&#39;t anymore).</p><p>There is one slight problem with this, although it otherwise worked me 100% for past 10 years - if you get kids and are not utter sellfish a-hole, you will lose most of this, at least for some (long) time. Positive side is, one day you will be one hell of inspiration for them.

It never happened to me, and I overshot my level by mistake few times. The more you gain experience, the less the risk.<p>One thing that usually helps with fear is actually exposing yourself to it rather than avoiding it - you are afraid to fall. Find safe overhang (or vertical if unavailable) ie in gym, and just fall in it. Then fall again. Practice technique - push yourself from the wall with legs during fall, not too much just to avoid contact.</p><p>Its just like SIV course in paragliding - you learn about bad situations that can happen and how to handle them by getting into them on purpose (and then either managing them or throwing reserve, usually all done above lake for extra safety). This allows you to progress further faster and gain confidence in you and your wing.</p><p>At one point, its your choice - push things always to the max for whatever reason, or just enjoy good climb that can be challenging (or not) but not scary. Progress happens on both, usually a bit less on latter.</p><p>For me, I cut off all chasing for higher difficulties, if my skill drops I enjoy the challenge of trivial routes again. And even non-challenging climb is a very fine experience for me and that&#39;s enough (especially now).</p><p>Previously, I enjoyed actually overcoming of that ever-present fear as the best part of climbing, building character and shaping personality. I do honestly believe in it, I mean you expose yourself for 2-4 hours to acute (even if baseless, but your brain doesn&#39;t recognize it) fear of death, <i>and</i> you continuously overcome it to achieve your goal. If that doesn&#39;t teach you about yourself, nothing will.

It never happened to me, and I overshot my level by mistake few times. The more you gain experience, the less the risk.<p>I&#39;ve just started to do sport climbing (like within the past 2 weeks), and my biggest fear is a screwup (equipment, amount of slack given out, belay device, etc) that results in me not getting caught. My mother likes to remind me that her friend&#39;s son was paralyzed from falling in a climbing gym (but unfortunately I do not have the details), which certainly doesn&#39;t help my fear. This fear isn&#39;t stopping me from doing anything, so to some extent I do think it&#39;s helpful / healthy since it&#39;s reminding me to be careful and limit my risks as much as possible.</p><p>That said, even just top rope climbing has significantly helped my fear of heights. Went hiking this past weekend, and I&#39;m definitely more comfortable near cliff edges, etc (still fearful of falling, but not in a debilitating way).</p><p>&gt; At one point, its your choice - push things always to the max for whatever reason, or just enjoy good climb that can be challenging (or not) but not scary.

I like to improve, and push myself, but this is something I&#39;d prefer to do for a long time, so I lean on the side of not pushing to hard and limiting risk whenever possible.

Not to take shortcuts which you think you‘ll somehow be able to compartmentalizations out of your life. And I think he meant it also to be applied in retrospect: Whatver you did, and whatever happened in your life... can you „own“ it, with all its apparent flaws, and pains and errors? Are you able to see yourself, and see your own life, beyond the categories of of good and bad? Can you, like a good author, take the good, the bad and the ugly from your past and create something of truth and beauty from it?

It&#39;s a recipe for disaster to try to live in short-term thinking day to day.</p><p>One of our greatest attributes is the capacity to think, plan and act for the long-term, as many of the things we want require such. Notice I didn&#39;t say everyone thinks long-term consistently; notice I didn&#39;t pretend all of our institutions think long-term all the time; both are standard issue sarcastic criticisms against long-term thinking, neither of which invalidate the value of long-term thinking.</p><p>The correct answer is that some things benefit from (and or require) short-term thinking (particularly immediate focus), some things benefit from (and or require) medium-term thinking, some things benefit from (and or require) long-term thinking. Where thinking implies the comprehensive (thinking, planning, acting, etc).

An alternative framing that I&#39;ve come to find more helpful is to take your life expectancy, and cut it by 2/3. For example, if you&#39;re 20 years old and your life expectancy is 80 (ie. 60 more years), pretend that you only have 20 more, so you&#39;ll only live until you&#39;re 40. It&#39;s nice cause it naturally adjusts as you get older. You&#39;ll have smaller windows to work with.<p>This approach strikes a nice balance. It gives you enough time to be able to really do something and change directions if you want. But not so much time that you can really waste any. It forces you to ask the hard questions about whether your day to day is truly connecting with your dreams, and whether you&#39;re on a path to get there.</p><p>Of course, Seneca didn&#39;t have life expectancy tables to work with. But I think he would have approved. :)
