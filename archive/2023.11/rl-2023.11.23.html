  <p id="yoGDB7">It used to be that <a href="https://www.vox.com/big-tech" data-source="encore">Big Tech</a> companies like <a href="https://www.vox.com/google" data-source="encore">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/meta" data-source="encore">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/apple" data-source="encore">Apple</a> led the way when it came to workplace advantages. On top of great pay, they offered freebies like gourmet meals, massages, and on-site laundry. Then, when the pandemic made the office a physical danger, those same companies were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/tech/google-work-from-home-coronavirus/index.html">among the first</a> to offer the ultimate perk: the ability to work where you wish.</p>
<p id="bBpUuN">But, as their stock prices have suffered, Big Tech has not only dialed back on many on-site perks, they’ve also called workers back to the office. Facing hard times, they’ve retrenched into what they knew before the pandemic, typically asking workers to come into the office three days a week. Google is even <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-gets-stricter-about-employees-time-in-office-9a20f2e">factoring office attendance</a> into performance reviews.</p>
<p id="ieg8Xj">Smaller tech companies have since picked up the mantle of <a href="https://www.vox.com/remote-work" data-source="encore">remote work</a>. They are much more likely than their larger peers to allow people to work fully remotely, with 81 percent of those with fewer than 5,000 employees either allowing remote work or only having remote options, according to <a href="https://www.flex.scoopforwork.com/reports/tech-industry">new data</a> from Scoop Technologies, a software firm that builds tech to help hybrid teams coordinate and also tracks the office policies at major companies. Meanwhile, just 26 percent of companies with more than 25,000 employees are fully flexible. </p>

<p id="CKzne0">Tech has the greatest variation in fully remote policy by company size than any other industry. This suggests that remote work is completely possible in the tech industry, but different-sized companies have settled on different policies based on how they think it benefits them or not. And their reasons for doing so might depend, in part, on how they want to portray themselves to the outside world.</p>
<p id="5zAnog">Why the so-called “flexibility divide” among tech companies?</p>
<p id="IqrPEN">Tech companies with fewer employees are using remote work as a way to pull in more talent in what had been a notoriously difficult hiring environment and to signify that they, unlike Big Tech, are where progress is happening. People in the tech industry, especially, are more likely to be lured by remote work, according to Gartner, which has found that better work-life balance and greater flexibility were the top benefits tech employees would choose over 10 percent higher compensation.</p>
<p id="mzUdCm">That’s a big deal for smaller tech companies, which haven’t always been able to compete with the Googles of the world in terms of salary. <a href="https://www.vox.com/airbnb" data-source="encore">Airbnb</a>, which employs more than 6,000 people, has used its work-from-anywhere policy to attract not only more applicants — its career page saw twice the traffic last year as it had the year before — but also more diverse ones, with 21 percent of new hires being under-represented minorities.</p>
<p id="43mqIM">“We want to hire the best talent we can all around the world,” Dave Stephenson, Airbnb’s CFO and head of employee experience, told Vox. “If we narrow that definition of getting the best talent around the world to being 50 miles around San Francisco, that’s going to put us at a disadvantage.”</p>
<p id="3mScOR">At the same time, Airbnb has cut its office footprint by half, slowed attrition, and marked its first <a href="https://skift.com/2023/02/14/airbnb-notches-first-full-year-profit/">full year of profitability</a>. The company pays to fly in its far-off employees — about 20 percent of its workforce — to be together from time to time. But this only happens if the company’s “ground control” team has deemed that there’s an important project that requires them to be in person.</p>
<p id="TdAJnx">“If they’re satisfied with their ability to balance their personal lives with their work lives, I think we get more effective performance out of people,” Stephenson said.</p>
<p id="TXsruJ">The situation is similar at Yelp, which also lets its 5,000 workers choose where they work and notched its sixth straight quarter of record revenue last quarter while also rolling out products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/yelp-rolls-out-ai-powered-search-updates-and-the-ability-to-add-videos-to-reviews/">AI-powered search</a>. The company says that remote work hadn’t hurt sales goals or engineering productivity but had caused a huge spike in its talent pipeline.</p>
<p id="sf9hpY">“I think we saw pretty early on during the pandemic that, wow, this is actually working,” said Carmen Whitney Orr, Yelp’s chief people officer, who joined the company remotely last year. “Happy employees are productive employees and that means happy customers.”</p>
<p id="PIHTzv">The ability to work remotely is most common among the smallest tech companies.</p>
<p id="K6GC5e">“If you can demonstrate that you’re able to create a team that is just as productive, if not more, by being remote, then there’s really no reason to not do it,” said Zuhayeer Musa, co-founder of tech compensation comparison platform Levels.fyi, which has nine workers. Levels.fyi was founded as a remote company in 2017, which Musa says makes it easier to continue working remotely. </p>
<p id="GsIvVa">In turn, remote work has meant the company has had better access to talent than it would if it demanded office attendance. </p>
<p id="nIfIvz">“If you require someone to move to a certain location, you are inherently limiting the talent pool that you’re going to be working with,” he said.</p>

<p id="EbHivH">That could be what Big Tech is doing. </p>
<p id="CbSSPC">Amid economic uncertainty, flagging stock prices, and years without major innovation, larger tech companies are using their calls back to the office to signify to shareholders that they are grown-up and responsible corporations. Gone are the days of ping-pong-playing engineers and squandered profits. Here are the days of penny-pinching and strict oversight, probably in an office environment. </p>
<p id="T0tGdO">In other words, what were once considered the most innovative and forward-thinking companies are behaving a lot more like their stodgy non-tech corporate counterparts. </p>
<p id="r3PEPq">When it comes to allowing fully remote work, policies at big tech companies are closest to their non-tech peers, like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1">Citigroup and Starbucks</a>. Like their non-tech counterparts, many tech companies have quickly shifted to a structured hybrid model, where workers have to come in a set number of days per week. The share of large tech companies that are doing hybrid (65 percent) is nearly the same as large companies overall (60 percent), as is the number of days per week they want people in (2.5 on average), according to Scoop.</p>
<p id="x8D70o">“Bigger companies, more complex companies, are more likely to be looking for more professional types of management,” said Kathy Harrigan, a professor of corporate management at Columbia University’s business school. “Investors expect that.”</p>
<p id="FMW7md">And professionalism to them means butts in chairs. Harrigan says in-person work is necessary to coordinate the complicated, varied businesses these tech conglomerates now operate. The move to AI has only made in-person coordination more of a necessity, she said.</p>
<p id="DQgK8s">“They’re working with a more complex kind of product. It means a lot more coordination from a lot of different points of view, where previously these workers were permitted to work in silos,” Harrigan said. </p>
<p id="0kumJj">One could argue that companies like Google, Meta, and Apple all ran very complex businesses during the pandemic, when they recorded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/11/22925859/big-tech-companies-2021-earnings-record-revenue-apple-amazon-alphabet-meta">record profits</a> while their workers toiled from home. </p>
<p id="lQgRoP">“In the face of volatility and uncertainty, it is human nature to want to revert back to something that is a known quantity,” said Caitlin Duffy, a research director at Gartner, about the push to return to the office. “And so there might be some psychological things happening that may be overriding the evidence in front of them.”</p>
<p id="crR69e">The evidence, she says, shows that offering flexibility in where people work makes them happier and, by extension, more productive and innovative. Accounts to the contrary were “unfounded.” What’s worse, Duffy said, is that arbitrarily calling people back to the office might actually hurt workers’ productivity and innovation by driving fatigue and burnout.</p>
<p id="7RBtco">Whether their back-to-office plans ultimately end up harming these companies remains to be seen. Big Tech companies, of course, might be able to sit back on their brand names and giant salaries to attract talent. But to some extent, with their flexible remote policies, small tech companies are expressing their ability to innovate and grow, just like the big guys used to do. </p>

news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can&#39;t rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on. \r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nFirst, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nSecond, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. We can’t do that if we have a paywall. \r\n &lt;br/&gt;\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nThat’s why we also turn to you, our readers, to help us keep Vox free. &lt;a href=\&#34;http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=biz-explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=article-footer\&#34;&gt;

    <div><p>
      Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can&#39;t rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on. 
</p><p>

First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.
</p><p>

Second, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. We can’t do that if we have a paywall. 
 </p><p>

That’s why we also turn to you, our readers, to help us keep Vox free. <a href="http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=biz-explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=article-footer"> If you also believe that everyone deserves access to trusted high-quality information, will you make a gift to Vox today?</a></p></div>

Let&#39;s not dismiss other&#39;s experience just because it doesn&#39;t match our own, the truth is most likely somewhere in the middle. Especially when so many people are clamoring saying that they had pain using K8s.<p>The initial deployment for EKS requires multiple plugins to get to something that is &#34;functional&#34; for most production workloads. K8s fails in spectacular ways (even using Argo, worse using Argo TBH) that require manual intervention. Local disk support for certain types of workloads is severely depressing. Helm is terrible (templating Yaml... &#39;nuff said). Security groups, IAM roles, and other cloud provider functions require deep knowledge of K8s and the cloud provider. Autoscaling using Karpenter is difficult to debug. Karpenter doesn&#39;t gracefully handle spot instance cost.</p><p>I could go on, but these are the things you will experience in the first couple days of attempting to use k8s. Overall, if you have deep knowledge of K8s, go for it, but It is not the end-all solution to Infra/container orchestration in my mind.</p><p>I fought with a workload for over a day with our K8s experts, it took me an hour to deploy it to an EC2 ASG for a temporary release while moving it back to K8s later. K8s IS difficult, and saying it&#39;s not has a lot of people questioning the space.</p><p>The way I see it is it starts off easy, and quickly ramps up to extremely complex. This should not be the case.</p><p>I worked at a company that had their own deployment infra stack and it was 1000x better than K8s. This is going to be the next step in the K8s space I believe and it may use K8s underneath the covers, but the level of abstraction for K8s is all wrong IMO and it is trying to do too much.

    ansible.builtin.group:
      name: somegroup
      gid: 2000
      state: present
  
  - name: Ensure that we have a user that belongs to the group
    ansible.builtin.user:
      name: someuser
      uid: 3000
      shell: /bin/bash
      groups: somegroup
      append: yes
      state: present
</code></pre>
This can help you setup some monitoring for the nodes themselves, install updates, mess around with any PKI stuff you need to do and so on, everything that you could achieve either manually or by some Bash scripts running through SSH. Better yet, the people who just want to run the containers won&#39;t have to think about any of this, so it ensures separation of concerns as well.<p>Deploying apps through Ansible directly can work, but most of the container orchestrators might admittedly be better suited for this, if you are okay with containerized workloads. There, they all shine: Docker Swarm, Hashicorp Nomad, Kubernetes (K3s is really great) and so on...

Here&#39;s one way to avoid the issues you described on bare metal:<p>- Only get servers with IPMI so you can remote reboot / power cycle them.</p><p>- Have said servers netboot so they always run the newest OS image.</p><p>- Make sure said OS image has a config that isn&#39;t broken so you don&#39;t get full inodes and so it cycles logs.</p><p>- Have the OS image include journalbeat to ship logs.</p><p>- Have your health checks trigger a recovery script that restarts or moves containers using one of a myriad of tools; monitoring isn&#39;t exactly a new discipline.</p><p>Yes, it means you have to have a build process for OS images. Yes, it means you need to pick a monitoring system. And yes, it means you need to decide a scheduling policy.</p><p>I wrote an orchestrator pre-K8S that was fewer LOC than the <i>yaml config</i> for my home test K8S cluster.

I think anyone that&#39;s been a Systems Engineer that&#39;s over 30 has probably deployed every one of these.</p><p>One thing I&#39;ve learned over my mixed SWE and SE career is that infrastructure is expensive and grows regardless of revenue. I didn&#39;t truly appreciate this until I launched Kubernetes on Digital Ocean and began running my personal cloud on it. It was costing me over $100/m for very little. That money was gone whether I pushed a ton of VPN traffic over my mesh or not. It didn&#39;t care about how much I stored in the disk I reserved, and frankly, that cost was going to grow as time went on. I pulled the plug, setup servers in my house, wired up Traefik and Docker Compose V2 with a little Tailscale sprinkled on. The servers stay up to date with some scripts, I deploy new apps on select servers with Docker Compose and Docker profiles.</p><p>It&#39;s possible for companies to do similar things, but not to the extremes I took it to. A really good infrastructure SWE generally goes for $300k. You can pay people with an expertise in these things who can streamline them and create maintainable products out of your infrastructure or you can pay for Legos and glue from a managed service provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure. At some point the latters costs will not scale, you&#39;ll pivot and cost reduce many times - maybe even begin rearchitecting. I think there&#39;s a lot of companies that are noe realizing the cheap money is gone, and the cloud has somewhat relied on cheap money.

I come from a background of running small startups on a shoe string budget. I need to make tough choices when it comes to this stuff. I can either develop features or start spending double digit percentages of my development budget on devops. So, I aim to minimize cost and time (same thing) for all of that. At the same time, I appreciate things like observable software, rapid CI/CD cycles, and generally not having a lot of snow flakes as part of my deployment architecture. I actually have worked with a lot of really competent people over the past two decades and I like to think I&#39;m not a complete noob on this front. In other words, I&#39;m not a naive idiot but actually capable of making some informed choices here.<p>That has lead me down a path of making very consistent choices over the years:</p><p>1) no kubernetes and no microservices. Microservices are Conways Law mapped to your deployment architecture. You don&#39;t need that if you do monoliths. And if you have a monolith, kubernetes is a waste of CPU, Memory, and development time. Complete overkill with zero added value.</p><p>2) the optimal size of a monolith deployment is 2 cheap VMs and a load balancer. You can run that for tens of dollars in most popular cloud environments. Good enough for zero down time deployments and having failover across availability zones. And you can scale it easily if needed (add more vms, bigger vms, etc.).</p><p>3) those two vms must not be snow flakes and be replaceable without fanfare, ceremony, or any manual intervention. So use docker and docker-compose on a generic linux host, preferably of the managed variety.  Most developers can do a simple Dockerfile and wing it with docker-compose. It&#39;s not that hard. And it makes CI/CD really straight forward. Put the thing in the container registry, run the thing. Use something like Github actions to automate. Cheap and easy.</p><p>4) Use hosted/managed middleware (databases, search clusters, queues, etc). Running that stuff in some DIY setup is rarely worth the development time and operational overhead (devops, monitoring, backups, upgrades, etc). All this overhead rapidly adds up to costing more than years of paying for a managed solution. If you think in hours and market conform rates for people even capable of doing this stuff, that is. Provision the thing, use the thing, and pay tens of dollars per month for it. Absolute no brainer. When you hit thousands per month, you might dedicate some human resources to figuring out something cheaper.</p><p>5) Automate things that you do often. Don&#39;t automate things that you only do once (like creating a production environment). Congratulations, you just removed the need for having people do anything with teraform, cloudformation, chef, puppet, ansible, etc. Hiring people that can do those things is really expensive. And even though I can do all of those, it&#39;s literally not worth my time. Document it, but don&#39;t automate it unless you really need to and spend your money on feature development.</p><p>But when I need to choose between hiring 1 extra developer or paying similarly expensive hosting bills, I&#39;ll prefer to have the extra developer on my team. Every time. Hosting bills can be an order of magnitude cheaper than a single developer on a monthly basis if you do it properly. For reference, we pay around 400/month for our production environment. That&#39;s in Google cloud and with an Elastic Cloud search cluster included.</p><p>Other companies make other choices of course for all sorts of valid reasons. But these work fine for me and I feel good about the trade offs.

I think system design interviews are partly to blame because they select for people who think that the only way to design a system is the cargo cult method that interview prep books and courses preach, which is:<p>- break everything into microservices</p><p>- have a separate horizontally scalable layer for load balancing, caching, stateless application server, database servers, monitoring/metrics, for each microservice.</p><p>- use at least two different types of databases because it&#39;s <i>haram</i> to store key-value data in a RDBMS</p><p>- sprinkle in message-passing queues and dead-letter queues between every layer because every time you break one system into two, there can be a scenario where one part is down but the other is up</p><p>- replicate that in 10 different datacenters because I&#39;ll be damned if a user in New York needs to talk to a server in Dallas</p><p>And all this for a service that will see at most 10k transactions per second. In other words, something that a single high-end laptop can handle.</p><p>99.9% of the time your architecture does NOT need to look like Facebook&#39;s or Google&#39;s. 99% of tech startups (including some unicorns) can run their entire product out of a couple of good baremetals. Stop selecting for people who have no grounding of what is normal complexity for some given scale.

I&#39;m currently working at the opposite of a startup with a shoestring budget. We&#39;re a medium-sized company with 100 - 150 techies in there. As a unique problem, we&#39;re dealing with a bunch of rather sensitive data - financial data, HR data, forecast and planning data. Our customers are big companies, and they are careful with this data. As such, we&#39;re forced to self-host a large amount of our infrastructure, because this turns from a stupid decision into a unique selling point in that space.<p>From there, we have about 7 - 12 of those techies working either in my team, saas operations, our hardware ops team, or a general support team for CI/images/deployment/buildserver things. 5 - 10% of the manpower goes there, pretty much.</p><p>The interesting thing is: Your perspective is our dream vision for teams running on our infrastructure.</p><p>Like - 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3: Ideally, you as the development team shouldn&#39;t have to care about the infrastructure that much. Grab the container image build templates and guidelines for your language, put them into the template nomad job for your stuff, add the template pipeline into your repository, end up with CD to the test environment. Add 2-3 more pipelines, production deployments works.</p><p>These default setups do have a half life. They will fail eventually with enough load and complexity coming in from a product. But that&#39;s a &#34;succeed too hard&#34; kinda issue. &#34;Oh no, my deployment isn&#39;t smooth enough for all the customer queries making me money. What a bother&#34; And honestly, for 90% of the products not blazing trails, we have seem most problems so we can help them fix their stuff with little effort to them.</p><p>4 - We very much want to standardize and normalize things onto simple shared services, in order to both simplify the stuff teams have to worry about and also to strengthen teams against pushy customers. A maintained, tuned, highly available postgres is just a ticket, documented integrations and a few days of wait away and if customers are being pushy about the nonfunctional requirements, give them our guarantees and then send them to us.

  2) entropy *always* increases (RAM usage, memory corruption, hardware issues, OS misconfiguration etc.) so eventually the application will break and stop serving traffic until it&#39;s repaired/restarted (which can take time if it&#39;s a hardware issue)

  3) deployments are tricky if there&#39;s nothing before the executable (stop, update, restart =&gt; downtime)

  4) if cache is in-process, on a restart it will have to be repopulated from scratch, leading to temporary slowdowns (+ and maybe a thundering herd problem) which will happen *every time* you deploy an update
</code></pre>
I think much of it is ignoreable if the site is just a personal blog or a static site. But if the site is a real time &#34;web application&#34; which people rely on for work, then you still need:<pre><code>  1) some kind of containerization, to deal with inevitable entropy (when a container is restarted, everything is back to the initial clean state)

  2) at least two instances of the application: one instance crashes =&gt; the second one picks up traffic; or during rolling updates: while one instance is being killed and replaced with a new version, traffic is routed to another instance

  3) persistent data (and sometimes caches) need to be replicated (and backed up) -- we&#39;ve had many hardware issues corrupting DBs

  4) automatic failover to a different machine in case the machine is dead beyond repair

MTBF on servers is on the order of years, so hardware failure is genuinely rare until you get too many servers into one distributed system. And even then, two identical boxes (instead of binpacking into a cluster, increasing failure probability) go a very long way.<p>It&#39;s a vicious circle. We build distributed multi-node systems, overlay software-configured networks, self-healing clusters, separate distributed control planes, split everything into microservices, but it all makes systems <i>more</i> fragile unless enough effort is spent on supporting all that infrastructure. Google might not have a choice to scale vertically, but the overwhelming majority of companies do. Hell, even StackOverflow still scales vertically after all these years! I know startups with no customers who use more servers than StackOverflow does.

Many bugs are pretty rare bugs which are triggered only under specific conditions (a user, or the system, must do X, Y, Z at the right moment). So it doesn&#39;t happen all the time. But when it happens, the whole server crashes or starts behaving in a funky way and other users are affected. Sure you may say if it&#39;s a rare bug, then users will be rarely affected. But we don&#39;t have a single bug like that, there&#39;s always N such bugs lurking around (we never know how many of them in a large application); multiply it by N bugs and you have server crashes for different reasons quite often, making your paying customers dissatisfied. It also assumes you can fix such a bug immediately while it&#39;s not always true, there&#39;s often Heisenbugs it takes weeks to root out and fix, while your customers are affected (sure the application will restart but ALL users (not just the one who triggered the bug) can loose work, get random errors when the app is not available -- not a good experience). So having several app instances for backup allows to soften such blows, because there will always be at least one app instance which is available.</p><p>&gt;Entropy increases with complex setup. The whole point of not having a complex setup is to reduce entropy and make the system as whole more predictable</p><p>I agree that entropy increases with complex setup, but there&#39;s also base entropy which accumulates simply because of time (which I think is more dangerous). Like make a sufficient number of changes to the setup of your application (which you often need if you release often) and eventually someone or something somewhere will make a mistake or expose a bug somewhere, and you will need to repair it and you won&#39;t be able do it easily because your setup is not containerized which would allow to return to the clean state quite easily with no effort. We&#39;ve had issues like that with our non-containerized deployments and it&#39;s a very complex and error-prone undertaking to do it flawlessly (no downtime or regressions) compared to containerized deployments.</p><p>&gt;Plus modern CPUs are incredibly fast and can process several GBs of data per second. Even in the worst cases, you should be able to rebuild all your caches in a second</p><p>Hm, usually caches are placed in front of disk-based DB&#39;s to speed up I/O, i.e. it&#39;s not a matter of slow CPU&#39;s, it&#39;s a matter of slow I/O. Rebuilding everything which is in the caches from DB sources is not super fast.

It can scale when clusters and blast radius is small but can be complicated when it involves contributions from n teams.
For this reason when we were managing our own k8s cluster on prem, we were using kubespray which worked but upgrades were a multiple hours affair.

Today was a good day.</p><p>Later, whilst inebriated from celebration, I make some changes to the app and deploy live because I&#39;m a cowboy. Oops, the app fails to start but that&#39;s okay, the deployment rolls back. No one notices.</p><p>The next day my app hits the front page of HN and falls over.

F5? MySQL replication?? How is this a good use of engineering time? How is this cost efficient? On what planet is running your own metal a good use of time or money or any other godforsaken resource.

I want to find quotes to cherry pick but the entire thing is lunacy. You can do so <i>so much</i> on a cloud provider before approaching the cost of even a single 48U in a managed space.</p><p>At some scale it makes sense, but not their scale. If I never have to deal with iDRAC again it&#39;ll be too soon.</p><p>You have a horse in this race: apps like Tadalist are best run on something like Fly or knative/Cloud Run or Heroku rest in peace. But a set of conventions around bare-metal containers/VMs? Give me a break.</p><p>I don&#39;t think you intended it, but I find it disingenuous to separate cloud hosting and kubernetes. The two are connected. The entire premise is that it should be a set of portable conventions. I can run things on my laptop or desktop or raspberry pi or $10/mo budget VPS or GCP or AWS or Azure or Linode or god willing a bunch of bare-metal in a colo. It&#39;s fundamentally a powerful abstraction. In isolation it makes little sense, which TFA handedly demonstrates. If you eschew the conventions, it&#39;s not like the problems go away. You just have to solve them yourself. This is all just NIH syndrome, clear as day.</p><p>Forgive the long winded rant, it&#39;s been a long day.

BUT it is true that all the multi region/AZ guarantees + logs + dashboards + network services @ AWS costs tend to skyrocket in a couple of years.
And here is where k8s really shines, in my opinion: allowing you to abstract your deployment away from a cloud even on cheap hosting.

It&#39;s actually one of the most very straight forward and thoughtfully designed platforms I&#39;ve ever worked with.<p>What I&#39;ve found in my experience is that applications in general are complex -- more complex than people assume -- but the imperative style of provisioning seems to hide it away, and not in a good way. The inherent complexity hides behind layers of iterative, mutating actions where any one step seems &#34;simple&#34;, but the whole increasingly gets lost in the entropic background, and in the end the system gets more and more difficult to _actually_ understand and reproduce.</p><p>Tools like ansible and terraform and kubernetes have been attempts to get towards more definition, better consistency, _away_ from the imperative. Even though an individual step under the hood may be imperative, the goal is always toward eventual consistency, which, really only kubernetes truly achieves.  By contrast, MRSK feels to be subtly turning that arrow around in the wrong direction.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it was fun to build, but one could have spent 1% of that time getting to understand the &#34;complexity&#34; of kubernetes - by the way, which quickly disappears once it&#39;s understood.

You cannot limit them to X bytes.  So, if you give a single service a volume, it might just take the whole disk.  Well, technically, it might just take the whole filesystem, which, if you have multiple disks used by a single filesytem, will mean it&#39;ll take all of them.<p>Obviously, you cannot move local volumes around.</p><p>And if you are setting up a database in Kubernetes... oh, you are in such a pit of troubles, that dealing with local volumes isn&#39;t really even worth mentioning.  Surprisingly, your problems don&#39;t even start with storage, they start with memory.  Databases really like memory, but use it very opportunistically, and scale well with load.  So, when you configure your database, you tend to give them all the memory you have, but when they use it, it will really depend on the load and the kind of queries, how well they optimize it.  Since Kubernetes scheduler doesn&#39;t really do well with reservations, you may run into situations where your database OOMs or just slows everything down, or doesn&#39;t perform well at all...</p><p>Next comes fsync.  Unlike many unsophisticated applications, databases don&#39;t like losing data.  That&#39;s why they want to use fsync in some capacity.  But this creates problems sharing resources, again, well beyond anything Kubernetes can help with.</p><p>Next comes provisioning of high-quality storage for databases... and storage likes to come in the form of a device, not filesystem, but Kubernetes doesn&#39;t know how to deal with devices, so, it needs a help from CSIs of all sorts to do that, and depending on technology you choose, you&#39;ll have a very immersive journey into the world of hacks and muti-thousand page protocol descriptions telling you how to connect your storage and Kubernetes.</p><p>It might appear though, at the first glance, that things work well w/o much intervention, and there&#39;s a Helm chart for this or the other provider, and it&#39;s all at the tips of your fingers... but, as it often is in the world of storage, things get extremely complicated extremely quickly in case of errors.  In such situations, Kubernetes will only obscure the problem.  Oh, and errors in storage don&#39;t usually happen in the next hour or day or even year after you&#39;ve set it up.  It hits you few years later, once you&#39;ve accumulated a ton of useful data and you&#39;ve entirely forgotten how things have been set up, and folks in Kubernetes had moved on and broke stuff.</p><p>---</p><p>So, not only do you need small scale, you also need a very short temporal scale: don&#39;t expect your Kubernetes cluster to work well after about a year of being deployed. Probably not at all after five years.</p><p>But then... if it only works at small scale and for short time? -- is it really worth the trouble? I mean, Kubernetes isn&#39;t a small thing, it takes away a big constant share of your resources, which it promises to amortize with scale.  You are essentially preaching the same idea as Electron-based desktop applications or Docker containers that create a lot of duplication of entire Linux user-space + a bunch of common libraries if you aren&#39;t extremely careful with that. Doesn&#39;t it become an argument for producing hot garbage as fast as possible so that someone else who can do a better job won&#39;t get a chance of selling their goods because they didn&#39;t have time to deliver?

        <p>Leadership and management are often conflated, but they are distinct and complementary skills. As a principal engineer, chances are you have experience with both, but your focus is now less on building the organization (planning, resourcing, managing expectations) and, instead, on improving technical aiming and execution across the organization: helping teams navigate through complex technical, product or organizational tradeoffs, mediating and resolving escalations, and driving technology and process improvements.</p><p>The role of most Director and VP managers requires that they balance their time across a wide range of teams and initiatives, which gives them breadth but limits their bandwidth and ability to go deep: they may not have the time to do a thorough review of the proposed architecture; dig deep into technical or cross-team product tradeoffs; objectively mediate a gnarly cross-team escalation. If the Director+ managers are by necessity wide-and-shallow (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills?ref=ilya.grigorik.com">T&#39;s</a>), Principal Engineers are focused-and-deep (I&#39;s). A close partnership across these complementary roles is a key building block for organization&#39;s success.</p><div><p><em>This is a living guidebook based on first-hand experience and many enlightening conversations with Principal, Distinguished, and Fellow-level engineers at Shopify, Google, and beyond. Not everything here may translate to your organization in particular, but I suspect the majority of it is broadly universal and applicable.</em></p></div><h2 id="what-does-a-principal-engineer-do">What does a Principal Engineer do?</h2><p>The role is a combination of self-directed search and hands-on problem solving of topics that are bubbling up from within the organization or are delegated to you by the executive team. For example, your time may be spent on self-directed reviews of design documents and code, engaging with other managers and leaders to help navigate tradeoffs, or leading a deep-dive evaluation of a proposal or product at the request of a Director or VP—you are their trusted technical co-processor.</p><p>Self-directed search relies on deep expertise, hard-won wisdom, and good judgment. You need to invest in open-ended exploration (reading design docs, code reviews, etc.) and apply active pattern matching—e.g., identifying challenges surfacing across projects or teams. Observing is not enough, however. To be successful, you also need to exercise good judgment—what is worth flagging or escalating? now, or later? with whom?—and have good organizational awareness to effectively engage, influence, and effect change. Often, you are the connective tissue: connecting individuals and teams, manufacturing serendipity to open up collaborations, and quietly supporting and cheering from the back. </p><p>Hands-on problem solving is born out of close collaboration with your organization&#39;s leadership team. They rely and may call on you to help with a specific project; vice versa, you need to partner with them to help unlock resources and drive prioritization for technical and cross-team initiatives that may otherwise not surface or remain overlooked.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-identify-and-prioritize-opportunities-to-focus-on">How do you identify and prioritize opportunities to focus on?</h3><p>Knowing where and how to spend your time is one of the hardest evergreen questions for every Principal engineer. The opportunity space is vast. The terrain is changing continuously. Your superpower is the ability to engage deeply, which requires staying flexible and continuously re-calibrating where and how your attention is spent. Be thoughtful about your role and ongoing engagement; know when to extract yourself and be thoughtful on what you commit to. As a helpful role rubric…</p><ul><li><strong>Owner:</strong> directly responsible for aiming, execution, and outcome.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder:</strong> responsible for aiming within function or domain.</li><li><strong>Supporter:</strong> ad hoc and on-call engagement, as necessary.</li><li><strong>Friend:</strong> no structural commitment, volunteer.</li></ul><p>In practice, you can be an effective owner on one or, at most, two initiatives and consult as a stakeholder and supporter across a few more. As a result, the hard part is not sourcing opportunities but filtering: saying &#34;no&#34; to demands on your time and continuously reassessing your role in existing commitments; the hard part is being deliberate in what important problems you have to say &#34;no&#34; to. Don&#39;t  get spread thin. </p><p>Develop and invest in strong horizontal partnerships with other product and engineering leads—managers and ICs—across the organization. You need to live at the border between product and technical priorities and strategy and be equally versed in both to guide technical aiming and execution across the organization effectively.</p><h2 id="what-does-success-look-like-for-a-principal-engineer">What does success look like for a Principal Engineer?</h2><p>The tactics of your engagement style and definition of success depend on the organization and stakeholders you support. In some cases, the role may have a strong external component, as a visible technical representative and partner with the external community or customers, and in others, it may be inwardly focused as a technical leader within a specific product or a problem domain—e.g., security, infrastructure, ML, API design, etc.</p><p>Principal Engineers&#39; common leverage point is in the friction areas and unrecognized opportunities across teams and products. Teams optimize for their local optima needs; your job is to help guide the organization towards better global outcomes. All decisions at this level require tradeoffs across teams and projects, execution speed, and business priorities. Your scope spans teams and your leverage is as a process facilitator and trusted guide through this foggy landscape.</p><h3 id="archetype-facilitator-partner-and-mentor">Archetype: facilitator, partner, and mentor</h3><p>Often you are the most senior person in the room. Most of the time, this does not mean that you are the most knowledgeable person in the room for the specific problem domain, although your experience and broad expertise may give you a perspective and insights that others don&#39;t have.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s not your job to solve the problem.</strong> Your job is to partner with TLs and experts closest to the problem domain and work together to identify the path to the best outcome. Chances are, you are in the room because there are trade-offs or decisions to be made that span beyond the immediate team, and your job is to serve as an objective and impartial guide on the journey. The team should own the outcome and execution. Your responsibility is to improve the quality, aiming, and outcome of the decision process.</p><p><strong>Focus on perspectives</strong>. The combination of senior role and broad engagement gives you a neutral and objective perspective on technical and business priorities: practice active listening to understand the team&#39;s objectives; provide the team alternate points of view, or competing requirements, that they may not be aware of. Partner with and support the leads. You&#39;re not there to over-rule them—that&#39;s a recipe for failure because they own execution. Done right, the team should feel ownership of the outcome and acquire new skills to, hopefully, mediate similar outcomes by themselves in the future.</p><p><strong>Build technical leaders</strong>. Your job is to identify the gaps and create safe leadership spaces for others to grow into, a process that requires a combination of effective sponsoring and mentorship. The former is about enabling and sometimes actively encouraging folks to lean into an opportunity, and the latter is about supporting their execution. Your success is their success; their success is a long-term amplifier of your and organization’s success.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-capture-and-prove-your-impact">How do you capture and prove your impact?</h3><p>The impact and contribution of a Principal Engineer typically span across technical, product, and organizational domains. Unlike a manager role, which leans on direct organizational and team impact against organization priorities, your success relies on successfully claiming shared credit across teams and initiatives.</p><p>Establish clarity about your role upfront—see role rubric above—with yourself and each team you engage with. Doing so helps clarify your commitment and desired outcome. For example, if you&#39;re engaging as a consultant, ensure that others understand that and leverage your time and expertise in the appropriate format.</p><p>Recognize that the definition of success may look and feel different. Past career milestones usually came in the form of launches and landings, in which you played a direct and critical role. Moving forward, success and leverage will often come through empowering and teaching others: engage, mediate, coach, ..., and quietly recede without anyone noticing; pave the paths with senior stakeholders to reduce or eliminate resource contention and cross-team dependencies; prune complex design trees by clarifying desired state and principles of the overall system.</p><hr/><h2 id="tactical-everyday-tips-and-best-practices">Tactical everyday tips and best practices...</h2><ol><li><strong>Protect and leave large blocks of uninterrupted time on your calendar.</strong> The nature of the role requires time flexibility, enabling you to jump on board an escalation or pursue a self-directed lead on short notice.</li><li><strong>Lead by example and model the behavior you want to see in teams you engage with.</strong> You are often the most senior person in the room. Pay close attention to the language you use and how you engage. Even when you&#39;re able to see around the corner, take the long route and lead the team through your thinking; be careful on how you frame questions — e.g., lean on &#34;I am curious...&#34; and &#34;Help me understand...&#34; instead of a simple &#34;Why?&#34;, which is more easily perceived as a challenge or confrontational. Model humility and figure out how to help others succeed.</li><li><strong>Be deliberate about your exposure and role in day-to-day organizational information flow.</strong> Partner with other product and engineering leaders to ensure that you&#39;re part of key planning, review, and org conversations. At the same time, be clear with yourself and others on where you do vs. do not need to be involved or consulted on—see 1.</li><li><strong>Build close horizontal relationships with other engineering and product leaders.</strong> The best results for both come from close collaboration, where they&#39;re able to focus on macro organizational execution and needs, and you can leverage your expertise to unblock technical discussions and improve cross-team execution across projects.</li><li><strong>Cultivate weak ties by practicing active curiosity</strong>. Reserve time to explore outside of your primary domain, volunteer your help, and pay it forward. Before long, you&#39;ll be manufacturing serendipity by connecting people and initiatives. Conversely, a robust network of weak ties can make all the difference in your ability to activate an idea or a project.</li><li><strong>Proactively engage teams and TLs.</strong> Counterintuitively, the number of inbound requests for support or feedback from individual teams may not be very high. Most are reluctant to volunteer or share their challenges with senior stakeholders. Use your position and time flexibility to random-walk  (domain, function, and level) the organization: keep an ear to the ground and identify hidden gaps and opportunities.</li><li><strong>Share your findings and thoughts to draw out feedback.</strong> You have a broad vantage point that others don&#39;t have access to. Volunteer your findings and thoughts to reach a wider audience and draw out feedback—e.g., via a semi-regular &#34;on my mind&#34; email that shares recent insights or findings with a broad group. </li><li><strong>Solicit feedback and monitor lagging indicators to adjust your execution.</strong> Being clear on your role across projects helps establish expectations and opens opportunities for better feedback. Longer-term, track lagging indicators like team re-engagement and product success: are the teams or individuals you&#39;ve worked with coming back; did your engagement result in positive launches and landings? The further you go, the more abstract and delayed the feedback becomes, be proactive about it.</li><li><strong>Maintain a breadcrumb trail and document your engagements.</strong> Draft 1-pager for each commitment that clarifies your role, title, time commitment, and shared goals upfront. Being explicit establishes clear shared expectations and provides an artifact to evaluate your success against in the future.</li></ol><hr/>
