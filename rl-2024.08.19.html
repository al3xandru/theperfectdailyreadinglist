I also loved doing custom stuff like having this top/bottom design where only my latest post was above the fold in the white area, with the rest of the page below (something Blogger couldn&#39;t do at the time). </p><p>Fast forward a few years and I was getting tired of maintaining my own code and I was loving <a href="https://movabletype.org/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">Movable Type</a> for every other blog I wrote on, so I created a hybrid site where Movable Type handled all my blogging entires, but it spit out files I could include in custom templates, letting me make my site do anything I wanted.</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1956" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.35-PM.png 2184w"/></figure><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1994" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.40.47-PM.png 2170w"/></figure><p>This 2004-era version of the site was probably my absolute favorite. I spent months working with various APIs to build the right sidebar dynamically. </p><p>This was the early era of Web 2.0 where anyone could finally create things on the internet by just clicking buttons and filling out forms on web apps. But as I used these services, I got kind of bummed when thinking how I was posting but not on my personal site. To combat this, I used all the data sharing features of Web 2.0  to pull in my recent music listens, upcoming events I was attending, longer essays I wrote, my daily photo, a blogroll, my Flickr photos, and even links to comments I made on <em>other</em> sites. </p><p><strong>I called this iteration &#34;The Temple of Ego&#34; and it felt like the ultimate expression of what a personal blog could do for the owner.</strong> If you wanted to know who I was, you could scroll down the sidebar and get a pretty complete picture of <em>every single thing</em> I was doing online at the time.</p><p><em>(plus: how cool was it to use old timey wallpapers on a modern blog?)</em></p><p>A year or so later, I got tired of fiddling with my own code again so I moved this site to <a href="https://www.typepad.com/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">TypePad</a>, which was a hosted version of Movable Type. This was huge for me, because it was the first time I ever used an outside service for hosting all my content. I still made my own custom templates at Typepad, but I didn&#39;t have to run my own server, and I instantly felt relieved.</p><figure><img src="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2133" srcset="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 1000w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/size/w1600/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 1600w, https://a.wholelottanothing.org/content/images/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-15-at-9.50.22-PM-1.png 2018w"/><figcaption><span>This site in 2007</span></figcaption></figure><p>Around 2010, I grew tired of Typepad&#39;s stagnant features and decided to finally go all-in on Wordpress.

<p>Emacs is a fantastic tiling window manager, and not enough people know that. There, it’s out now; I said it; now everybody knows. And thanks to a number of consolidations and improvements, it’s no longer the indomitable black box it once was.</p><p>At some point in the distant past, Emacs got into the business of handling frames. I’m sure you, like me, eschew frames in favor of windows. Frames are just that much harder to deal with — unless you’re using an actual tiling window manager, of course. But few do, and the baleful support for frames in regular window managers nix any temptation to make it work.</p><p>Later on, tabs also joined the family business. <code>M-x tab-bar-mode</code> adds tab-style window configurations to Emacs, and <code>M-x tab-line-mode</code> a way of browsing visible buffers.</p><p>Back to windows. They’re one of Emacs’s greatest assets, and they’re highly configurable. Historically it was a rather difficult affair to control window and buffer placement as you’d have to rein in a cavalcade of variables and functions and hope they did what you wanted. But not any more.</p><p>Modern Emacs is now able to mirror the paneling so beloved of IDE users, and without the tears! And you can easily control how or where buffers and windows must go, giving you even more control over your Emacs experience. That means you may not need a third-party window management library – if you ever tried to use one, that is – for most things.</p><p>So here’s a snapshot of what is possible today:</p><dl><dt>Grouping Windows</dt><dd><p>You can now group windows so certain commands that affect one now affect all of them. They’re given the cryptic name <em>atomic</em>.</p><p>When you call <code>C-x 0</code> and delete an atomic (ugh) window, all other windows that belong to that cohort also disappear. It does come with a couple of limitations, but it’s still a great feature.</p></dd><dt>Dedicating Windows</dt><dd><p>You can dedicate a window to a buffer. Dedicated windows are locked to the buffer it was dedicated to, and so any attempt to switch its buffer will merely display that buffer in another window. And if you switch to a buffer that belongs to a dedicated window, Emacs selects the dedicated window instead.</p><p>This feature solves another common complaint: that it’s easy to screw up a perfectly manicured window layout – like <code>gdb</code>’s debug view, <code>M-x calc</code>, your fancy Org agenda setup, and so on – because you accidentally switched buffers in one of them.</p></dd><dt>Sidebars</dt><dd><p>You can now attach a window to one of the four sides of a frame: left, right, top or bottom. Sidebars are like their kin in other IDEs: they are a full-length (or full-width) windows that resist switching and splitting.</p><p>With a sidebar you can finally dedicate sides of a frame to specialized buffers, like the Calendar, Org Agenda, Compilation Output, GDB, you name it. And thanks to a handy command, you can toggle the sidebars to hide or show them all at once.</p></dd><dt>Override window and buffer placement</dt><dd><p>Almost all window customization now involve one – albeit elephantine – variable that controls all of it.</p><p>Much like Emacs’s reformed <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/understanding-minibuffer-completion">minibuffer completion system</a> you’re able to precisely control how Emacs creates and shapes windows using a tiered system of overrides. And package authors can still suggest a preferred layout that you can override if you want to.</p><p>Using a regular expression you can command all python buffers to appear only in open windows that already have python mode buffers; you can order <code>M-x eshell</code> to always pop up a new window, no matter what; or insist that <code>M-x compile</code> buffers appear as a side bar on the right-hand side of your screen, and that it must never change your selected window’s buffer.</p><p>You can also dictate if you can switch to windows with <code>C-x o</code>, or even prevent Emacs from deleting a window, and thus preserve your layout, even if you use <code>C-x 1</code>.</p></dd></dl><p>These four concepts give you near-complete control of all aspects of Emacs’s window management, and that’s not even everything. Yet they’re enough to put you firmly in the driver’s seat.</p><p>And the best thing about it all? Experimenting with it is easy and interactive. If you use my snippets of <a href="#templates-examples">templates and examples</a> you can use them as a starting point for your own window excursions.</p><h2 id="important-terminology-and-concepts">Important Terminology and Concepts</h2><h3 id="switching-buffers">Switching Buffers</h3><p>There is a subtle but important distinction between displaying a buffer and switching to it. Switching is done with <code>C-x b</code> (or its sibling commands, like <code>C-x 4 b</code>) and it is the default user-facing key binding for switching a window’s buffer.</p><p>By default Emacs distinguishes between automatic and manual window switching. If you effect a window switch yourself with <code>C-x b</code>, it’s manual — and exempt from any display action rules you create yourself.</p><p><strong>You probably don’t want that</strong>. I recommend you set this:</p><pre><code><span>;; Requires Emacs 27+</span>
(<span>setq</span> switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions <span>t</span>)</code></pre><p>Now Emacs treats manual buffer switching the same as programmatic switching.</p><p>However, it also guards against (some) misbehaving commands you may encounter: those that call out to <code>switch-to-buffer</code> programmatically. That is “against the rules”, as <code>switch-to-buffer</code> is a <em>user-facing</em> command.</p><h3 id="picking-the-right-window">Picking the Right Window</h3><p>Thanks to a concerted cleanup, <code>display-buffer</code> is now the ultimate arbiter of where your buffer and/or window goes. And that’s a good thing indeed, as the previous system required a mish-mash of <code>let</code>-bound variables and mystery functions to do what you wanted.</p><p><code>M-x display-buffer</code> is both a command and an important internal function. It’s called in one of several ways. Here are two common scenarios:</p><ul><li>A function somewhere wants to compel Emacs to display a buffer in a frame, like <code>M-x calendar</code>.</li><li>You have manually switched buffers with <code>C-x b</code>, <code>C-x 4 b</code>, <code>M-x ibuffer</code> or some other means.</li></ul><p>Eventually they – if they’re programmed right – call, either directly or indirectly, <code>display-buffer</code> to do this. By centralizing the display of buffers you can more easily control how it happens.</p><p>Programmatically, <code>display-buffer</code> takes an optional <code>ACTION</code> argument with a <em>suggested</em> display action. At this point in time, the <code>ACTION</code> is a <em>guideline</em>. Emacs may, or may not, follow it; that’s important, because <code>display-buffer</code> decides where things go, and it does so by consulting this list:</p><ol><li>First it checks <code>display-buffer-overriding-action</code>, but that is for Lisp use only, so we won’t talk about it again.</li><li>Then it checks <code>display-buffer-alist</code>, which we very much <em>will</em> talk about, as it’s the most important variable in Emacs’s window management system.</li><li>Then it checks the <code>ACTION</code> argument.</li><li><p>Then it checks <code>display-buffer-base-action</code>, which is a catch-all default.</p><p>It’s a user-facing variable you can configure, and unlike <code>display-buffer-alist</code> it can only hold one <code>ACTION</code>.</p>Although we won’t talk about it much, it’s mostly there so you can build a catch-all rule for windows that don’t fall under rules 1, 2 or 3.</li><li><p>At last it checks <code>display-buffer-fallback-action</code>, but that is also for Lisp only.</p><p>The variable is only consulted last, and it’s the variable of last resort if there are no other actions that match.</p></li></ol><p>Although the term <code>ACTION</code> is thrown around a lot, it’s a bit of a misnomer, I think. It’s really a <em>constraint</em>. It is a mixture of “do <em>that</em>” along with “but only if <em>these facts hold true</em>”.</p><p>You see, when you ask Emacs to display a buffer it checks the aforementioned list. Each variable in that list may hold – particularly in the case of <code>display-buffer-alist</code> – rules that Emacs must check before it decides on the next course of action.</p><p>The first set of constraints – actions – that satisfy Emacs, wins. It’s perfectly fine to have more than one set of constraints that match a given buffer; just know that the first one Emacs encounters is the one it picks.</p><p>So as you can see, the <code>ACTION</code> argument in #3 is really more of a guideline, even though the package author had a particular layout in mind when they wrote it. That means elisp hackers can’t know for sure if Emacs will <em>actually</em> display a buffer the way they intended — good!</p><p>Look no further than <code>M-x speedbar</code> for a disastrously bad example of curtailing choice. Speedbar only works in a standalone frame, and it’s impossible, without a third-party hack, to get it to display in a window.</p><h4 id="predicated-actions">Predicated Actions</h4><p>The <code>display-buffer</code> function checks a list of variables (and its own <code>ACTION</code> argument) to determine what it needs to do. They’re all, in one way or another, made up of <code>ACTIONS</code>.</p><p>Here’s the name of a function, and one part of, an action: <code>display-buffer-same-window</code>. As its name alludes to, it’ll display a buffer in the same window (same refers to the <em>selected</em> window.) Its definition looks like this:</p><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> display-buffer-same-window </span>(buffer alist)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>or</span> (<span>cdr</span> (assq &#39;inhibit-same-window alist))
              (window-minibuffer-p)

If you split your frame into a kaleidoscope of windows, each doing their own thing, and you then add a bunch of custom rules, like:</p><ul><li><code>*info*</code> and <code>*Help*</code> windows go in a sidebar on the left;</li><li>All Python buffers recycle existing Python windows;</li><li><code>*Compilation*</code> mode buffers always pop up in a new window, split along the top, with a height of 10 lines.</li><li><code>*EShell*</code> buffers, once shown, are marked dedicated.</li></ul><p>You’re giving Emacs a large number of rules it must abide whenever you display a buffer. Not only must Emacs respect the rules you’ve defined in <code>display-buffer-alist</code>, but it must also contend with the <em>existing</em> windows and their buffers in your frame.</p><p>Now where should the next buffer you want to display go?</p><p>That is the dilemma Emacs faces when it must place both a buffer and maybe create a window. For every rule you add, you are constraining Emacs’s ability to pick (what it thinks) is the best place for a window or a buffer.</p><p>Dedicated windows, sidebars, forcing Emacs to re-use a window, or enforcing a minimum height or width for a window — they all add up to to a laundry list of <em>constraints</em>.</p><p>Emacs is not always able to do what you tell it to. Given a sufficiently complex web of rules, it’s possible those rules conflict with one another (and your current window layout) and so Emacs is unable to follow those rules.</p><p>That is why Emacs has a “safety valve”, of sorts. It’ll do its darnedest to respect the rules you set, and if it can’t, it’ll turn maverick and just display it somewhere. That’s why, despite Emacs’s best intentions, it may switch a buffer in a window you told it not to touch, or even – as the <em>last</em> resort – create a brand-new frame.</p><p>It’s rare, but it can happen.</p><h3 id="trees-windows-and-internal-windows">Trees, Windows and Internal Windows</h3><p>Emacs tracks your current window layout in a tree structure called the window tree. The window tree represents the dimensions and location of every window in your current frame. A tree structure is ideally suited to this task, as subdivisions are either horizontal or vertical, which Emacs represents as nodes in the tree. The tree also knows where your minibuffer is, but that is not very interesting to us, although it <em>has</em> a window also.</p><p>You can browse your current window tree <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/evaluating-elisp-emacs">by evaluating</a> <code>(window-tree)</code>.</p><p>When you split a window, Emacs creates a new node in the tree that holds the <em>live windows</em> (the ones with buffers in them.) But as you successively split windows, you’ll end up with nodes in the tree that aren’t <em>actual</em> windows in your frame. Those nodes are called internal windows.</p><p>Internal windows aren’t terribly interesting to us, so I won’t belabor their role in Emacs’s window tree much. The only thing you need to know is that whenever you split a window, Emacs needs to keep track of each distinct, <em>live</em>, window you see on the screen. It does so with ‘invisible’ windows called internal windows.</p><p>Consider this:</p><pre><code>+----------+-----+-----+
|          |     |     |
|    R1    | R2  | R3  |
|          |     |     |
+----------+-----+-----+</code></pre><p>If <code>R1</code> is the selected window and you want to split below, then all you need to do is call <code>C-x 2</code>. But if you want to split <em>across</em> <code>R1</code> through <code>R3</code> you can’t — not with <code>C-x 2</code> anyway.</p><p>But it <em>is</em> possible: but you must split from the shared parent of <code>R1</code>, <code>R2</code> and <code>R3</code> — an internal window.</p><p>Without an internal window, or some other structure that can represent the relationship between windows, you wouldn’t be able to split across those three windows.</p><p>Although it’s not super-duper important to know about, internal windows play an important role when you want to carry out actions that involve the parent, children or siblings of windows.</p><h2 id="splitting-windows">Splitting Windows</h2><p><em>Note: Emacs 29 adds native support for this. See <code>M-x split-root-window-&lt;right/below&gt;</code>.</em></p><p>The default split commands – <code>C-x 2</code> and <code>C-x 3</code> – split below or to the right of the selected window. Sometimes, though, you may want to split from the <em>root</em> of the tree. So if you want a full-length window below or to the right of all your other windows, you can, with a little bit of elisp:</p><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> mp-split-below </span>(arg)
  <span>&#34;Split window below from the parent or from root with ARG.&#34;</span>
  (interactive <span>&#34;P&#34;</span>)
  (split-window (<span>if</span> arg (frame-root-window)
                  (window-parent (selected-window)))
                <span>nil</span> &#39;below <span>nil</span>))</code></pre><p>You’re free to replace <code>below</code> with <code>right</code> if you want it to split to the right instead, or swap the order of the <code>if</code> statement if you’d rather invert the operation.</p><p>If you want to bind it to a key, check out my article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/mastering-key-bindings-emacs">binding keys in Emacs</a>.</p><p>This command works well when you want to split against the parent of the selected window, or from the root with <code>C-u</code>.</p><p>Indeed, <code>split-window</code> is the function that all the other ones call when they want to split a window. The distinguishing factor is the <code>WINDOW</code> argument, as it controls the window you want to split from.</p><p>Splitting from <code>RT1</code> with <code>M-x mp-split-below</code> yields:</p><pre><code>+----------+-----+-----+
|          | RT1 | RT2 |
|          +-----+-----+

It’s not an ironclad guarantee; there are instances where Emacs is up against the wall and has to put something <em>somewhere</em>.</p><p>Having said that, window dedication works well, and you should definitely use it.</p><p>A dedicated window confers the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Switching buffers manually with <code>C-x b</code> fails with an error.</p><p>You can customize <code>switch-to-buffer-in-dedicated-window</code> and control how it behaves.</p><p>I set it to <code>pop</code>, because I want it to open the buffer somewhere else instead. But there’s also <code>ignore</code>, and it’ll ignore your switch; <code>nil</code>, which raises an error and stops the switch; and <code>t</code>, that undedicates the window and switches.</p><p>Note that if you use custom completion frameworks that circumvent <code>C-x b</code> (<code>switch-to-buffer</code>) like <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode">Ido Mode</a> it may not behave exactly this way.</p></li><li>Splitting a dedicated window with <code>C-x 2</code> and <code>C-x 3</code> fails with an error.</li><li>Emacs will not switch buffers in dedicated windows.</li></ul><p>However, dedicated windows are not immovable objects. You can still delete the windows with <code>C-x 0</code> or <code>C-x 1</code>; kill the buffers they belong to; or resize them.</p><p>The function <code>set-window-dedicated-p</code> handles the dedicating. Unfortunately it’s not exposed to users by default, so let’s fix that by making a little elisp helper that toggles dedication in the selected window:</p><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> mp-toggle-window-dedication </span>()
  <span>&#34;Toggles window dedication in the selected window.&#34;</span>
  (interactive)
  (set-window-dedicated-p (selected-window)
     (<span>not</span> (window-dedicated-p (selected-window)))))</code></pre><p>Note that the documentation is quite diffuse about the flag you can set. Here I toggle between <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>, but it accepts a range of non-<code>nil</code> values. Values like <code>side</code> is not as <em>strong</em> a dedication as setting it to <code>t</code> is.</p><p>But yeah. Just toggle between <code>t</code> and <code>nil</code> and it’ll generally behave the way you want.</p><p>Another approach is setting <code>dedicated</code> flag directly in <code>display-buffers-alist</code>, but more on that later.</p><p>The command is still useful, though: you can set and unset it as part of your window layout workflow, by <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/keyboard-macros-are-misunderstood">using a keyboard macro</a>.</p><h2 id="side-windows">Side Windows</h2><p>Side windows are full-length windows attached to either the <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code> or <code>right</code>-hand side of a frame. You can have more than one side window attached to the same side of the frame, and you can have sidebars on more than one side at a time.</p><p>A side window and a dedicated window go hand-in-hand, and they share many similarities. Side windows are also dedicated, but they set <code>dedicated</code> to <code>side</code>, which is not as strong a promise as setting it to <code>t</code>.</p><p>Every side in a frame has a number of slots, controlled by the <code>window-sides-slots</code> variable. If you want to use side windows, then I strongly recommend that you customize it and set limits on how many you’ll allow on each side. Once you exceed the number of slots, Emacs will instead cycle the buffers in the existing side bar windows.</p><p>Side windows are special because you can order them relative to one another using their <code>slot</code>, an integer position.</p><p>They also benefit from a really neat command that toggles side windows visible or invisible: <code>M-x window-toggle-side-window</code>. Really useful command to know about if you’re flanked on all sides and want to briefly toggle them off.</p><p>One thing to be aware of is that, if you’re experimenting with windows, that the frame’s <em>window state</em> can get out of whack. The fix is to <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/evaluating-lisp-forms-regular-expressions">evaluate this form</a>:</p><pre><code>(set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) &#39;window-state <span>nil</span>)</code></pre><h2 id="controlling-buffer-and-window-display">Controlling Buffer and Window Display</h2><p>If you want to control where a buffer or window must appear, you must customize <code>display-buffer-alist</code>.</p><p>It’s a little… complex.

Insert an entry and click around a bit to get a feel for what it’s about. Don’t worry too much about making sense of the component parts of it yet. I’ll explain that in a moment.</p><h3 id="recommended-settings">Recommended Settings</h3><p>First things first though.

(Remember, sidebars are also a form of dedicated window.)</p><p>I prefer <code>pop</code> to the default, as I’d rather have it pop up the buffer somewhere else than simply error out. That then goes hand-in-hand with the next variable.</p></dd><dt><code>switch-to-buffer-obey-display-actions</code></dt><dd><p>If <code>nil</code>, the default, user-switched buffers are exempt from display buffer actions set in <code>display-buffer-alist</code> &amp; friends. Requires Emacs 27.</p><p>You probably want those rules to affect your interactive buffer switching, as it makes for a consistent buffer switching experience. I set it to <code>t</code> myself.</p><p>I find that some packages and functions disregard all rhyme and reason and use <code>switch-to-buffer</code> instead of <code>display-buffer</code> when they want to show a buffer to the user.</p><p><strong>This is wrong</strong>. And the net result is that your display rules won’t apply if this variable is not set to <code>t</code>.</p></dd></dl><h3 id="testing-and-experimenting">Testing and Experimenting</h3><p>If you’re not an elisp expert I recommend you use the <em>Customize</em> interface.</p><p>You can use it to browse and tweak <code>display-buffer-alist</code>, even though my examples below use elisp.

That’s <em>almost</em> always enough.

ACTION_N)</code> list of actions.</p><p>But what’s an <code>ACTION</code>? Well, the description for <code>display-buffer</code> does proffer a list of suggested <code>ACTION</code> functions, <strong>but this is not the complete list</strong>.</p><p>To get the complete list you… well, you have to hope they’re sensibly named.</p><p>This is one way to find the builtin ones:</p><pre><code>C-u C-h a ^display-buffer-[^<span>-</span>]</code></pre><p>Note that you may find a few stray functions that have nothing to do with windows. But as you scan the list, you’ll see a pattern:</p><pre><code>display-buffer-below-selected
display-buffer-at-bottom
...</code></pre><p>They’re <code>ACTION</code> entries. Or as I prefer to think of them: predicated actions.</p><p>Recall that they not only determine where something goes, but also check if they’re able to carry out the action in the first place!</p><p>Whether you specify a single <code>ACTION</code> or a list of <code>ACTION</code>s, the outcome is the same:</p><p>Emacs cycles through one of more <code>ACTIONS</code> and it stops <strong>when it receives the window the buffer was displayed in</strong>.</p><p>That means you can order your preferred display methods in the order you want Emacs to try them. It also means that a sneaky display action can change stuff and <em>not</em> return a window — necessitating more work by Emacs. That is, as far as I know, only used in one place (so far.)</p><p>For instance, you can declare that <code>*Help*</code> windows must:</p><ol type="1"><li>First <code>display-buffer-reuse-window</code>, which tells Emacs to find an existing <code>*Help*</code> window and re-use that one.</li><li>Next, try <code>display-buffer-pop-up-window</code> and pop up a new window with the buffer.</li><li>And if that fails, the entire display entry is skipped and Emacs continues with the next one in <code>display-buffer-alist</code>.</li></ol><p>That example works like this:</p><pre><code>(add-to-list &#39;display-buffer-alist

It will ‘stick’ to nearby atomic windows, if such windows exist.</p><p>You can control where it is displayed relative to an existing window by setting <code>window</code>.</p><p>You must also specify a <code>side</code> where the new window is created, relative to <code>window</code>.</p><p>Useful for “shared” windows that must only exist as long as the other, related, windows exist.</p><p>One example is <code>M-x calc</code> and its calculation window and history window.</p></dd><dt><code>display-buffer-in-child-frame</code></dt><dd><p>Really intriguing option that pops up an internal child frame, as opposed to a top-level frame.

‘side’ denotes the side of the frame where the new window shall be located.  Valid values are ‘bottom’, ‘right’, ‘top’ and ‘left’.  The default is ‘bottom’.

‘slot’ if non-nil, specifies the window slot where to display BUFFER.  A value of zero or nil means use the middle slot on the specified side.  A negative value means use a slot preceding (that is, above or on the left of) the middle slot. A positive value means use a slot following (that is, below or on the right of) the middle slot.

  &#39;(<span>&#34;</span>\\<span>*Compilation</span>\\<span>*&#34;</span>
    display-buffer-reuse-window))</code></pre><p>We match against one buffer name, <code>*Compilation*</code>; with one <code>ACTION</code>, <code>display-buffer-reuse-window</code>; and no <code>ALIST</code> settings, so it’s not listed.</p><p>A more complicated example might look like this:</p><pre><code>(add-to-list &#39;display-buffer-alist
 &#39;(<span>&#34;</span>\\<span>*info</span>\\<span>*&#34;</span>
   (display-buffer-in-side-window)
   (side . right)
   (slot . <span>0</span>)
   (window-width . <span>80</span>)
   (window-parameters
    (no-delete-other-windows . <span>t</span>))))</code></pre><p>There’s a bit more going on here. I want <code>*info*</code> windows in a side bar window; it must be on the right-hand <code>side</code> and in <code>slot</code> 0; the <code>window-width</code> must be 80; and Emacs must set the window <code>no-delete-other-windows</code> window parameter to <code>t</code>.</p><pre><code>(add-to-list &#39;display-buffer-alist
 &#39;(<span>&#34;</span>\\<span>*Help</span>\\<span>*&#34;</span>
   (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-pop-up-window)
   (inhibit-same-window . <span>t</span>)))</code></pre><p>Here I insist that <code>*Help*</code> buffers reuse any existing <code>*Help*</code> window if such a window exists. And if that is not possible, it must pop up a new window. Furthermore, Emacs cannot use the same (selected) window, and it must use another.</p><h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2><p>Let’s talk limitations. There’s a large corpus of third-party packages – and a number of internal ones in Emacs – that don’t know or care about cooperating with you or your window configuration. More often than not it’s because they believe their settings are the best; they may well be right, but it’s still wrong. And older packages are at least partially excused, as they predate the modernization efforts. But there’s a large body of up-to-date packages that don’t create or manage windows correctly even when it’s most likely easier to do so.</p><p>If you encounter such a package – they are more common than you think – you have little in the way of recourse beyond working around the code, or raising an issue with the maintainer(s).</p><p>In particular, package authors must use <code>display-buffer</code> (or <code>pop-to-buffer</code>) and avoid the temptation to write long tracts of elisp that manicure a window immediately after displaying a buffer. Calling out to <code>display-buffer-xxxx</code> actions is also not allowed.</p><h2 id="moving-around-undoing-window-changes">Moving Around &amp; Undoing Window Changes</h2><p>If you’re not already aware, <code>M-x winner-mode</code> is a builtin minor mode that lets you undo (and redo) window configuration changes. They’re bound to <code>C-c &lt;left&gt;</code> and <code>C-c &lt;right&gt;</code>, respectively, by default.</p><p>There’s also a near-equivalent for tab bar window configurations called <code>M-x tab-bar-history-mode</code>. You can now run <code>M-x tab-bar-history-forward</code> and <code>M-x tab-bar-history-backward</code> to cycle through changes made in the active tab’s window layout.</p><p>I also want to quickly mention <code>windmove</code>. It’s a package that makes it possible to move (switch to a buffer) in all four cardinal directions using – by default – <code>S-&lt;left/right/up/down&gt;</code>. It notably got an upgrade in Emacs 28 to let you delete or create windows in a direction also.</p><p>You may prefer <code>windmove</code> to <code>C-x o</code>. I prefer <code>M-o</code> though as the default is awful. <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/my-emacs-keybindings">More about my personalized key bindings here</a>.</p><h2 id="templates-examples">Templates &amp; Examples</h2><p>Here’s a selection of templates that demonstrate all the concepts you’ve read so far. They’re designed to selectively override how Emacs displays buffers and windows.</p><p>I recommend, as always, that you experiment thoroughly. That is easiest if you don’t <code>add-to-list</code> (it’s all too easy to end up with near-duplicated entries) but instead <code>setq</code> or the <em>Customize</em> interface.</p><p>One common theme that I see a lot of newer users ask for is a way of <em>repeating</em> their favorite layouts, particularly between restarts or if the layout is changed. So I recommend <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/keyboard-macros-are-misunderstood">you record a keyboard macro</a>. Keyboard macros are more than capable of not only opening files, splitting windows or switching buffers, they can do nearly everything you can do. So give them a try. No elisp required.</p><p>Another suggestion is to use <code>tab-bar-mode</code>. A tab is merely a window configuration — nothing more, nothing less.</p><h3 id="handy-helpers">Handy Helpers</h3><p>You don’t have to use a regular expression to match buffer names. There’s a little mini-language you can use instead; it’s usually enough for most things.</p><p>Instead of the <code>car</code> of your <code>display-buffer-alist</code> entry containing a string, you can use a form that is interpreted by Emacs’s display mechanism.</p><p>The docstring for <code>buffer-match-p</code> explains it all, but I’ll throw in a few examples.</p><h4 id="matching-with-the-buffer-matching-language">Matching with the buffer matching language</h4><pre><code>(add-to-list &#39;display-buffer-alist
           &#39;((<span>or</span> (major-mode . Info-mode)

Info-mode) (major-mode . help-mode))</code> that will match if the major mode is either of those two.</p><p>The docstring starts bloviating about <code>cadr</code> this and <code>cdr</code> that to describe what you can put where; but I think it’s easier to just think of it as:</p><ul><li>Either a cons cell with an explicit rule in the shape of <code>(A . B)</code>. Where <code>A</code> is something like <code>major-mode</code>, or <code>derived-mode</code> and <code>B</code> is the value it must match;</li><li>A (nested) bool form of <code>(BOOL REST)</code> where <code>BOOL</code> is <code>or</code>, <code>and</code>, etc. and <code>REST</code> is any number of cons cells or more BOOL values.</li></ul><p>There are other things you can put in there, like a string, which is what most people think of when they use <code>display-buffer-alist</code>. So you can indeed use the boolean system to test multiple regexes; or a combination of calling a function, checking the <code>major-mode</code>, and so on.</p><h4 id="only-match-buffers-that-have-a-project">Only match buffers that have a project</h4><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> mp-buffer-has-project-p </span>(buffer action)

The stdlib is great but the ecosystem isn&#39;t. Which web framework? Does it come with a logger? If not which logger? Do the third party libraries I want to use work with my logger/have a mechanism to provide one via an interface or am I shit out of luck? This goes for so many more things though, cache libraries, data structures (because Go stdlib collections are a joke). Contrast to Java here you have a relatively minimal set of very long-lived deps for all of these &#34;basic&#34; things. Ecosystems like Spring, the slf4 facade, Apache etc provide the foundation that most Java programs sit on and that has no alternative in Go land.</p><p>Go module transition was also hot garbage. It&#39;s better after sure but going through it was worse than Java 8-9 or to Java 11+ both of which were &#34;difficult&#34; transitions for Java but vastly less disruptive for me personally at least.
Then take all of this stuff and multiply it by the number of teams you have if you don&#39;t have a central team doing library choices and laying down architecture guidelines - which we eventually got but not before all the Go codebases had turned into by and large unmaintainable messes.</p><p>IMO Go is high velocity only in the simplest sense, it&#39;s very easy to pump out shit tons of code. With a big team of mediocre developers this is even more true. The problems all come later. Big change in requirements? Good luck with that.
Had a team try to go crazy functional with Go and now they have immutable data everywhere and allocations are completely destroying the throughput of the Go GC? Good luck fixing that. etc.</p><p>The velocity eventually moves from it&#39;s strength to it&#39;s achilles heel once the codebases are big and bad they are really hard to fix.</p><p>I get that most of these problems are &#34;big company&#34; problems and maybe in smaller teams with a stronger hiring bar you won&#39;t run into these or maybe not at the same severity but they severely impacted my view of how well the language scales to large teams and codebases.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I&#39;m with you, I think that Dart is very sensible and very underappreciated language. But he does have a point in saying that currently Dart is tied to Flutter. Google is presenting Dart as a language that you write Flutter with, not as a separate entity. I&#39;d much prefer if Google would present Flutter as a GUI framework for Dart, but alas. Perception is everything. As much as I&#39;d love to start my next project in Dart I probably won&#39;t because I can&#39;t be sure that Dart won&#39;t end up in Google&#39;s graveyard in next couple of years whereas I&#39;m pretty sure that Go won&#39;t.</p>

                  <p>Familiarity comes to mind.
Dart has developed into a nice direction with sound null-safety, extension functions, sealed classes and compilation to native&amp;wasm. (The libaries weren&#39;t very mature when I used Dart, not sure if that changed.)
I&#39;d pick Kotlin because I&#39;m familiar with it, but if mdhb is familar with Dart, maybe from his work with flutter, maybe from a time where you&#39;d mostly use Dart to compile it to js, then go for it.
Dart is a nice enough language to earn my thumbs up. (not that that would be important to anyone.)</p>

And, consequently, you need to keep up on updating Electron and distributing new builds to your end users, even if you haven&#39;t made any code changes.</p><p>I&#39;m not suggesting every Electron app is a giant bag of vulnerabilities, just that you have a lot more to keep on than you would writing with GTK or UIKit. And, since everything is bundled with the application, you can&#39;t rely on OS updates to fix things for you. You need to cut a new release and distribute it.</p><p>If you follow the Electron recommendations on security you&#39;ll be on the right path. You&#39;ll just find common tasks have become harder than they were back when Electron was attracting people with its ease-of-use. I found trying to do type-safe IPC to be an exercise in frustration. If you read the old docs, tutorials, or books, you&#39;ll find IPC used to be considerably more free-wheeling. Locking it down is the right trade-off, I think.

C# also has no useful interruption model. Java&#39;s interruption model is error prone, but at least you can work with it.</p><p>Async/await also splits the standard library and the ecosystem in 2 (blocking vs non-blocking, or blue vs red), and it can&#39;t automatically update the behavior of old code.</p><p>The introduction of virtual threads in Java also works well with &#34;structured concurrency&#34;, as seen with Kotlin&#39;s Coroutines. Kotlin&#39;s approach to concurrency is also superior to that of C#, actually. But what&#39;s interesting about Java is that its evolution is often one that involves runtime changes, lifting all boats. Java engineers preferred pushing more changes in the runtime, and somewhat ironically, the JVM ended up being the true multi-language runtime.</p><p>Java is a good case study of how languages should evolve. It has extreme backwards compatibility, and features being pushed are assessed for how they impact the whole ecosystem, including libraries or languages not in Oracle&#39;s control.

Moreover, a lot of the standard library cooperates with Java&#39;s interruption, which is why you see plenty of methods throwing `InterruptedException`; and it&#39;s also reflected in types such as `CancellableFuture` or the `Flow.Subscription` (reactive streams). Of course, user-level code that isn&#39;t well-behaved, can end up catching InterruptedException, or resetting the interruption signal, without actually interrupting. This makes Java&#39;s interruption model somewhat error-prone, but it&#39;s workable, and at least it&#39;s baked in.</p><p>Note that interruptions could also be preemptive, as you don&#39;t necessarily need cooperation. If you think of the call-stack, or flatMap/SelectMany in reactive APIs, the compiled code could check the interruption flag automatically and interrupt the call chain.</p><p>And resource leaks aren&#39;t necessarily a problem, if the interruption protocol is well-thought-out. In Java, try/finally still works in the presence of interruption, since at worst you get an `InterruptedException`. It&#39;s not ideal because you can interrupt the interruption process, and in truth the ideal would be for interruption to be its own communication channel, complementing that of exceptions. But it&#39;s totally doable, and here I am familiar with several libraries from Scala&#39;s ecosystem, namely Cats-Effect, Monix, and ZIO that show it (with limitations imposed by the runtime).</p><p>Either way, what C# provides is basically next to nothing. In fairness, some C# libraries tried fixing it, such as Rx.NET, but it&#39;s not enough. And the aggregate result in the .NET ecosystem is that interruption is not something people design for. Like what to interrupt a network socket? This ends up being a setting, presented as a timeout in case of inactivity, as a configuration of the connection, instead of a higher-level generic function that can be applied on the consumer side. And the probability for resource leaks goes up actually, because in the presence of concurrent races, you really need interruption.</p></div></td></tr>

I can create an exception that specializes from `IOException` and that I feel is really powerful.
Go added this half-baked and much later.

On the server-side, Java &#34;won&#34; the enterprise battle.  In the last 20 years, big corporates re-wrote their server-side C/C++ stack in pure Java (and thick desktop clients in C#).  It is so much easier to maintain than C/C++.

This overlooks this history of OOP.  Each decade, lots of new ideas have emerged so that skilled programmers continue to use the same languages (Java, C#, C++, C), but change <i>how</i> they use them.  C++ in 1996?  Let&#39;s fight about diamond inheritance!  C++ in 2006?  C++ in 2016?  C++ in 2026?  Repeat for all four languages that I mentioned.  The story will look similar.  Anyone good writing new code in these four languages isn&#39;t using many levels of inheritance.  It is gone.  Sure, it <i>exists</i> in the language for historical reasons, but it is hardly used in new code.  &#34;Prefer composition over inheritance.&#34;</p></div></td></tr>

And In Java there are concurrent sets, queues, barriers, phasers, fork-join pools, and etc. I&#39;d assume that even with Go&#39;s go routines, we can find great use of such containers, right? At least fork-join is not that trivial to implement.

                  <p>Because the predominant patterns are to do concurrency with message passing, so having multiple goroutines trying to mutate the same container is the exceptional case (though as you say, mutexes are the answer when needed). Another reason is containers are embedded features not stdlib, which has huge implications to how willing someone is to go against the grain, for better and worse.</p>

            try (....) { return task.apply(service) }

        var result1 = service.submit(() -&gt; slowOp());
        var result2 = service.submit(() -&gt; blockingOp());
        result1.get() + result2.get();
    });
</code></pre><p>
using static imports.</p><p>Now if you&#39;re making a cultural point then sure, Java APIs tend to be named quite explicitly. It has advantages when searching or auto-completing, and it&#39;s easy to wrap with aliases if you want to abstract a boilerplate pattern away.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Maven is okay-ish, Gradle is an abomination. Incremental compilation doesn&#39;t always work, and the fact that the build tools often spends a magnitude or more time just starting up than actually doing useful work is inexcusable.</p>

                  <p>I once posted an Ask HN: what are your build times. A golang developer stated their 25 million line project compiles in less than half a second. If that is really the case, I must say, this is very impressive and potentially a reason to switch from other languages.</p>
