Rather, it&#39;s better to setup a habit and routine, and stick to it for a long time, whether you accomplish anything during that time or not. E.g., work on blah for 30mins, at 9:30pm before sleeping, or at 6am when awake. Don&#39;t change this time, and don&#39;t do more time than originally planned (regardless of progress or lack thereof).<p>Habits are more powerful than self-control and discipline.

I like to simplify these complex topics to myself by gamifying them a little.<p>Imagine every time you make a conscious decision to do something you expend willpower points. You have a only a set number of willpower points a day.</p><p>Some things you like, some things you don&#39;t, and that depends how much they will cost. Choosing not to do something can also costs points, because it&#39;s a habit.</p><p>Habits are a way to reduce or discount this choice associated cost.</p><p>Now, I recently thought a lot about discipline, motivation, dreaming (for the future) and hope. And I think the problem with discipline is that, everyone has a different definition on it, and it also changes between context. Military discipline is not the same as daily discipline. Soldiers are plenty undisciplined in their daily lives.</p><p>When people talk about discipline they think &#34;doing things that one doesn&#39;t want doing&#34; but it&#39;s really not that simple. It all ties to hopefulness and dreaming for the future.</p><p>And s someone who&#39;s experienced this first hand due to a traumatic childhood: People who don&#39;t value themselves won&#39;t be disciplined for their own sakes, but they can be incredibly disciplined for the sake of others. So, there&#39;s a component of seeing value in what you do, or believe that there is value even if you don&#39;t see it.</p><p>So, like everything in life, discipline is multi faceted.</p><p>As an example, people talk about dopamine and motivation, but I&#39;ve realised that it&#39;s probably closely tied to discipline too. You need to be motivated to be disciplined.</p><p>I&#39;ve recently started becoming more &#34;disciplined&#34; by being incredibly intentional about trying to regulate my dopamine baseline throughout the day. I started doing it to feel less miserable throughout the day, but ended up being more disciplined as a side effect. And I&#39;ve also realised that this has increased my daily &#34;willpower&#34; budget from earlier.

However, then I turn to cold water. There&#39;s some research[^1] that shows that this creates an effect of slow dopamine release.</p><p>Next thing to do is be mindful about what gives you dopamine spikes, and how to not have them too often, since if you do it too much your body becomes &#34;used&#34; too too much dopamine. Basically, biology likes homeostasis, so it will find a way to achieve it.</p><p>This includes not drinking coffee too early too, but around midday/noon, and trying to couple coffee with activities you _want_ to enjoy, but not necessarily do, because coffee increases dopamine levels[^2], so it&#39;s &#34;hacking&#34; your brain to consider this reward-seeking behaviour by pairing the artificical dopamine increase with something you would like to enjoy (like say exercise, or learning a new skill, or work). There&#39;s other obvious benefits of caffeine like improved focus and concentration.</p><p>Now, all this might sound like &#34;too much dopamine,&#34; since it&#39;s very &#34;do this that gives you dopamine, do that that give you dopamine&#34;, but it&#39;s not that you&#39;re getting spikes in dopamine like you get from sex (or masturbation, or cocaine, etc), it&#39;s small releases that you strategically pair with activities that are good for you. Over time as they become habits you won&#39;t have to consume willpower for them, and you won&#39;t have to constantly be so intentional about what you do.</p><p>There&#39;s also the other side of the coin, like &#34;reducing&#34; dopamine. Doing stuff that you don&#39;t enjoy can suck, but sometimes that stuff is good for you. This is where the psychological component comes in. Thank yourself (think of yourself as your future self thanking your past/current self) for engaging in these activities after you do them. Gratitude releases dopamine, too[^3]. So the brain then associates this as reward seeking behaviour, and it becomes less hard in the future. It&#39;s not surprise that drug addicts will go to incredible lengths (I was a drug addict myself, so talking first-hand here) to get their substance of choice even if it&#39;s a giant chore and not enjoyable. Why? Reward-seeking behaviour; the reward is the dopamine, the behaviour is getting and consuming the drug. One could say they&#39;re incredibly disciplined to get that high (it&#39;s a weird way of putting it, but alas).</p><p>I&#39;ve also—somewhat unsuccessfully due to the childhood trauma mentioned earlier—tried to pick up mediation. It&#39;s helped me initially with focus and mindfulness, but caused some emotional problems. They are always there, but for a lack of better word, my chaotic mind was probably somewhat of a &#34;defence&#34; mechanism to mitigate CPTSD[^4]. This is a home-brewed theory me and my therapist came to. Going through the stages of grief for my &#34;lost childhood&#34; and my therapist&#39;s open-mindedness to psilocybin-aided therapy helped resolve this. I&#39;ve done Psilocybin later on my own as well, and I&#39;ve managed to make a lot of progress even on my own (but I have to thank my therapist and myself for developing the mental tools to explore those in a productive way). I wouldn&#39;t blanket recommend psychedelics since I&#39;ve had bad trips too, but they&#39;ve helped me immensely.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;ve went a bit on a tangent here. Back to dopamine control. I can luckily now safely meditate without &#34;relapsing&#34;, and that&#39;s helped a lot with focus, energy and overall willpower. It helps because I can choose what to focus on, and my mind is less ADHD-y. So this means you have to spend less &#34;willpower points&#34; on returning your mind to what matters to your &#34;conscious self&#34; (or ego). I don&#39;t know if I have ADHD or not, maybe; but it&#39;s likely related to the stuff I talked about earlier.</p><p>Meditation isn&#39;t very enjoyable for me, but as I started pairing it with gratitude and started seeing incredible benefits in my daily focus after only just about a week or so of daily 10-minute meditations, it&#39;s started to become enjoyable... Interesting even.[^5]</p><p>Listening to music releases dopamine too, but be careful you don&#39;t do too much of &#34;dopamine layering&#34; since the activity might be less enjoyable in the future without all these &#34;helpers&#34;, or it can offset your baseline too much. So, if you&#39;re at the gym for example, listen to music some days, but do a few days where you are doing it without the music. Try (it isn&#39;t always easy) to enjoy the atmosphere of the environment too.</p><p>Always remember to be grateful to yourself after these activities, too. Progress is sometimes too slow to see, and for progress-minded people, it can be a bit discouraging. But the progress is there, even though you might not realise it immediately. Trust yourself you&#39;re doing the right thing if you know it to be right.</p><p>Also, another big component in this whole thing is energy. So make sure your body is treated well in a holistic matter, not just your brain. The body and the brain are a unit, and we often forget that in our day-to-day-lives, I think. So, make sure you get enough sleep, eat healthy. It helps to take probiotics, especially with modern diets; I take mine daily, but you don&#39;t have to be as rigid with it as I am (but I also have digestive issues and my GP suggested probiotics and multivitamins; it helps a lot for me). Drink water, but depending on where you live don&#39;t drink tap water; buy a Brita water jug (or whatever the equivalent is in your region). It&#39;s easier to make tough decisions when you&#39;re not exhausted, and that means you expend much less willpower points when you do make them.</p><p>It&#39;s late and I might&#39;ve forgotten some stuff. I won&#39;t write much more so I don&#39;t risk you or someone else tl-dr-ing this (as I genuinely believe it&#39;s all good advice) but feel free to ask any follow-up questions if you&#39;re interested.</p><p>[^1]: Nicely summarised by Dr Huberman here <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure-for-health-and-performance/" rel="nofollow">https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure...</a></p><p>[^2]: This is well researched I think; just google &#34;coffee dopamine&#34; and take your pick</p><p>[^3]: This is more nuanced. You really need to do this with your full intent behind it. Murmuring a throwaway &#34;thanks buddy&#34; won&#39;t have the same effect. I combined this with journaling. I like to think __why_ was this good for me. Why do I think it helped me, how could it improve my life. Another big component with me is how I can improve the lives of people around me, since I&#39;m a bit of a people pleaser. So, I like to muse on that too. If my life is good, I&#39;m in a position to help others improve their lives, etc.</p><p>[^4]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_...</a></p><p>[^5]: I recommend reading The Mind Illuminated book.

I never look at my feelings, I sit down and do the work no matter what. The concept of having to motivate myself to do something sounds extremely foreign. It&#39;s not just that I&#39;m a workalcoholic, I always end work on time and I always wish I had more time for other things.<p>I have the discipline but I think the key is discipline + actually loving it, loving the thing that you are doing on average. Loving the process of discipline + loving the vision that you are working towards. I think that the passion and inspiration alone are not sufficient because there are always things you don&#39;t want to work on and you may really not feel like it sometimes, on the other hand, discipline for the sake of discipline without appreciation - having to push yourself... no. There must be both push and pull. If you don&#39;t feel any pull or if it&#39;s much weaker than the push then it most likely means that the sacrifice is not worth it or maybe you are doing way too much and not scheduling any time to appreciate the present moment.

To me, it&#39;s certainly not just about programming but the project / product in particular as well as how much ownership / leadership over the thing I would have. If it feels like it&#39;s a part of the bigger picture and I get to develop skills I want to develop, that could be quite fun, even if I was doing it for someone else. My experience to date with other people&#39;s projects was not that exciting though but I liked it because I had the time to work on my own thing alongside. I remember working 2 months on a client&#39;s project exclusively while not having any time for mine, I was approaching 50h/week just for that project. I liked it on average but I remember the last week was tough, I really felt like I had enough and just thinking through some ideas about a potential future product / project felt like gasping for air while being underwater for too long.<p>I think that&#39;s the general theme of this. So long as a significant chunk of the work (i.e. 1/3) is genuinely enjoyable just for what it is, the other, more boring work is also more pleasant because: 1) - it feels like a part of the bigger picture that you like (i.e. whether you are doing something really boring or maybe earning money to buy yourself more time) and 2 - just conditioning, getting good emotions from one part of the work is partially transferred to the boring stuff and it needs to happen on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The fact that there are boring parts to it (which one can still learn to appreciate) provides the contrast and makes the highs much higher. However, there&#39;s also something I did not mention initially. I&#39;m spending considerable time on appreciating the now, I would set aside 40 min every day to do Zen meditation and it really does help with the discipline / will power but perhaps most importantly - appreciating work that&#39;s boring - if I can get myself to enjoy sitting still or walking circles around the room, I can treat boring work not unlike extra Zen practice that sharpens me further. It does not have to be Zen practice but just ensuring that you are spending some time enjoying the now basically every day is critical when you you are often trying to make predictions about the future which is stress and anxiety inducing.

Sure, I know it&#39;s theoretically possible but I can&#39;t image what it takes to get here.<p>This thread has really made me realize what a disability ADHD is. I struggle to watch a movie from start to finish, even one I have been really looking forward to.  I dream of being able to concentrate and work on what I want to do for an entire day.  My ratio at the moment is about 1-2 hours of work in every 8 hour day.

It&#39;s basically a lifestyle of work and not much else, I set aside some time for a hobby which also involves socializing and that&#39;s why it&#39;s 60h/week (63h/week being theoretical max if nothing comes up) and not 70h/week.<p>Hitting the time on a regular day (not every day is like that) requires ongoing effort to sustain it. I spend 20 min / day doing time tracking and performance analysis (I think it makes more time than it costs). So for example if I want to hit 10h on a day which is purely dedicated to work, I wake up at 6, I end work at 8 and go to sleep at 9:30. That gives me 14h between 6 and 8, so it means that the combined time for the morning and midday routines must be under 4h. I don&#39;t stress about doing too little work on any given day, but I will always look at it the next day and consider what I could do better with the execution of the previous day . Then it mostly becomes a habit, I would just do it like a robot. Not every day is like that, but most are.</p><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your disability. I don&#39;t know much about ADHD but perhaps you would find the following tips useful. You could look into Zen meditation - a good book with the how is 3 Pillars of Zen, feel free to discard the supernatural stuff and just focus on regular practice. One of the main benefits of Zen practice is increasing your attention span. It&#39;s extremely challenging to sustain focus on nothing and I still struggle with this despite doing it regularly for 5 years. It could be as simple as counting exhales and resetting the count every 10 breaths, expect to lose track fast but you get better at it with regular practice and this directly translates to your attention span when doing other things. Maybe you could also benefit from journaling - try to successively increase work blocks by a small amount every week or so and keep track of it. Other tips: avoid scrolling social media, get good sleep - you may need up to 8.5h of bed time / 8h of sleep, it&#39;s easy to be chronically sleep depleted without being aware about it and everything is much harder without good sleep, do quick breaks while working, i.e. 1 minute pause every 15 min just looking at the timer (not email!).

    2 motivation 
    3 intention 
    4 discipline 
    5 habit 
    6 passion
</code></pre>
discipline is great but it&#39;s the part that takes willpower and it&#39;s not sustainable so if you don&#39;t like to do something you need the willpower to do it. it&#39;s not gonna last ever day for years. that people have to suffer to sustain things is misguided advice. the math doesn&#39;t check out.<p>sibling comment is correct here, discipline is necessary but only 1/6 of the framework. for long term sustainability we need habits plus higher order reasons to want to do it. passion ideally, or boosts of positive energy from inspiration and motivation.

I may be productive for a week, but sooner or later, something is going to happen that will allow me to procrastinate.

Don&#39;t confuse it with trying multiple implementations of one method - if you tried two to-do list apps and it didn&#39;t work for you, skip the to-do lists and move to something else. My method is body doubling, but YMMV. Once you find a method that works for you, revisit previous productivity methods - they may supplement your productivity

Medication can help, but even with strategies, tactics, and therapy, there is still brain chemistry at play. Medication can help, but has its trade-offs and isn&#39;t a silver bullet.<p>Self-discipline is also more costly. You can brute-force your way through tasks with ADHD, but it is more taxing on your overall energy. Those with ADHD typically experience impulses often and it&#39;s harder for them to ignore. Forcing yourself to ignore them requires extra energy. It&#39;s not sustainable to do all the time. It&#39;s hard for those without ADHD to truly understand what that&#39;s like.</p><p>In addition to impulsivity, executive dysfunction affecting starting tasks or work is also a big challenge.

After two years of IFS therapy my ADD is pretty much non-existent and my executive functioning is better than most people I know.<p>My hunch is that for a lot of people, ADD is a result of growing up in a home that felt unstable so they never gained a basic internal sense of stability that you need for things like task switching or staying focused.

You use the tools you have. If you have ADHD and a situation is unbearable, hyperfocus is a tool you have— or at least a pattern you can fall into— that can prevent you from being overwhelmed by the feelings that weigh on you when that situation is on your mind. It would be shocking to me if ADHDers didn&#39;t often end up relying on features of ADHD to adapt to traumatic situations.</p><p>These things are interrelated in people who have both, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s generally easy (or necessary) to pick apart &#39;which is which&#39; when it comes to a specific behavior or experience.

Let&#39;s say I have to mail a package at the post office. I&#39;ve got to write the address, pack it all up and then take it to the post office.  At 9am in the morning I genuinely feel like I&#39;m on the cusp of doing it.  I glance at my watch &#34;Oh, it&#39;s midday, better each lunch&#34;. No to worry, I&#39;ll get the package done right after lunch.  4pm rolls around and I realize that I might miss the closing time of the post of office so I rush to tape it up, write the address and hurry down there. I send it just in time.  At any time of the day you could have asked me &#34;Are you going to send that package now?&#34; and I would honestly say &#34;Yes, right away!&#34; but somehow it doesn&#39;t happen. On one level I know myself well enough to have seen this play out hundreds of times, but I still think this time will be different. It still feels like I&#39;m just about to send that package.<p>This happened on a much larger scale when I was in university. I had 18 months for my dissertation. Each week that went by I planned to write a small chunk of it, just to get going.  In the end I wrote the entire thing a week before the deadline with my professor literally sitting next to me making me do it.</p><p>&gt; I suspect you will be less likely to feel that inability to get around to do the tasks that you know to be important to do it if you fail in a way that life itself, the universe, hurts you for the failure, as opposed to your boss saying &#34;you&#39;re fired for showing up late&#34;.</p><p>This is true up to a point.  What ADHD people need is consequences ASAP.  Your boss checking in on you every hour and providing constant pressure is much more effective than a meeting at the end of the month where your boss blows his top and fires you because you&#39;ve done very little.

It is the case that one may not have a mindset of exclusively complaint, as one may have developed a capacity for more gratitude through the effort of being conscious. As long as there is any energy being exerted for complaint, that is energy that can be conserved and utilized for higher purpose.</p><p>For a complaint to reach all the way through the body and out the mouth, it must have already been processed through the brain. Complaining in all forms is a type of negative expression, and drains energy. The OP was commenting about how they complain going to the gym, at the gym, coming home from the gym, and while showering after the gym. I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re looking for as a definition of &#39;mindset of complaint&#39;, but this I&#39;d suggest this is suitable.</p><p>You can think of complaining, an expression of negativity, as basically a polar opposite of gratitude. To begin cultivating something of a higher order, it will help to attempt to &#39;reconcile&#39; the feeling of the two by feeling them both simultaneously. When you feel like complaining, or catch yourself doing so, make attempts to begin feeling gratitude. You&#39;ll soon find the gratitude will replace the complaining. After doing this enough, you will develop enough sensitivity and acumen to begin actually feeling both sensations at the same time, holding onto the &#39;complaining&#39; feeling, while reaching toward the gratitude as well. Over time, you will be able to find yourself &#39;integrating&#39; the two faster and faster, nearer the moment the feelings come into consciousness. Eventually (years), your &#39;complaining&#39; will be supplanted and you will have a different mode of experience.

The environment I escaped is the type of environment that books about learned helplessness (a concept at the center of modern therapy) are written about. I mention this only to add context to my personal experience, and to highlight that the mindset I had to escape was ingrained from the earliest age. In short, there was little to no &#34;supporting the development of agency&#34;, and in most cases, the exact opposite was true.<p>The process of therapy, whether that&#39;s CBT, ACT, etc. are all about making incremental changes that eventually all combine to rewire how you think and/or act. The entire therapy journey consists of these kinds of small changes along with active processing of past events to free up mental capacity. I&#39;m highlighting therapy here because the related disciplines have been studied extensively.</p><p>The same concepts apply in other contexts (and are common in fields like software). Outside of traditional methods of therapy, practices like mindfulness meditation have been studied quite a bit, and there is a growing body of research on its benefits [0]. In particular, it seems to lower friction for hard things by helping you see more clearly the reality of why you&#39;re struggling with doing things, and why <i>not</i> doing them is often worse in the long run.</p><p>&gt; <i>I would challenge that from the getgo.</i></p><p>To clarify, what are you challenging, specifically? The idea that small changes are easier to execute than large ones?</p><p>This has been the subject of deep exploration across many walks of life, and on the personal improvement front is at the center of books like Atomic Habits, which itself is based on a foundation of research. The reason small changes work is that we absorb them into our daily routines until they no longer require active thinking to accomplish.</p><p>Part of what happens is that you also start confronting the bad reasoning you&#39;ve been using to justify not acting. Embarrassingly, I had to re-establish basic habits like brushing my teeth. Clarity through mindfulness led to the realization that avoiding the tiny annoyance of doing this each day would be far less painful than the eventual dental issues I would otherwise suffer. I always <i>knew</i> that, but pausing to actually think clearly is what turned that knowing into a deep realization.</p><p>- [0] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_meditation" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_meditation</a> (linking to Wikipedia as a shortcut to the extensive references in the article if you&#39;re curious).

Each week I cover research, opinion, or practice in the field of developer productivity and experience. </em></p><p><span>This is a special issue to announce my </span><a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3595878" rel="">just-published paper</a><span> which defines a new approach to measuring developer productivity.</span></p><p>The premise for this paper is that today, many organizations attempt to measure productivity through metrics like lead time or pull requests completed. These methods, however, fail to capture the full story around productivity or drive actual improvements.</p><p><span>At </span><a href="https://getdx.com/" rel="">DX</a><span>, our team includes the world’s foremost experts on developer productivity including Margaret-Anne Storey (author of SPACE) and Nicole Forsgren (creator of DORA). Over the past several years, we’ve conducted </span><a href="http://paper.getdx.com/" rel="">rigorous research</a><span> on developer experience and learned a lot from our experience applying our research at DX.</span></p><p>Recently, we arrived at something we finally felt we could share – a new framework for measuring productivity which centers on the developer experience. By capturing qualitative insights from developers, and augmenting these insights with data from our systems, we can unlock clear signals on productivity and how to improve.</p><p><span>Continue reading on for a summary of the paper. For a deeper dive, check out the </span><a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3595878" rel="">full paper</a><span> as well as our interview on </span><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/developer-productivity-a-new-framework" rel="">The Pragmatic Engineer</a><span>.  </span></p><p><span>Leaders have long sought to improve the productivity of their developers, however knowing how to </span><a href="https://newsletter.abinoda.com/p/difficult-to-measure" rel="">measure</a><span> or </span><a href="https://newsletter.abinoda.com/p/define-productivity" rel="">define</a><span> productivity has remained elusive. Past approaches, such as measuring the output of developers or the time it takes them to complete tasks, have failed to account for the complex and diverse activities that developers perform. </span></p><p>Therefore, the question has remained: what should leaders measure and focus on to improve the productivity of their developers? The solution we recommend: improve productivity by measuring and focusing on developer experience.</p><p><span>Developer experience encompasses how developers “feel about, think about, and value their work”. In other words, </span><strong>developer experience is about the lived experience of developers and the points of friction they encounter in their everyday work.</strong></p><p>For example, interruptions, unrealistic deadlines, and friction in development tools negatively affect the developer experience. Conversely, having clear tasks, well-organized code, and pain-free releases improve the developer experience. Developer experience not only affects developer productivity, but also satisfaction, engagement, employee retention, and business performance. </p><p>Our DevEx framework distills the factors affecting developer experience into three dimensions: feedback loops, cognitive load, and flow state. Leaders can surface opportunities to improve productivity by measuring and focusing on metrics within the three dimensions. </p><p><span>1. </span><strong>Feedback loops </strong><span>refer to the speed and quality of responses to actions performed. Fast feedback loops allow developers to complete their work quickly with minimal friction. Slow feedback loops, by contrast, interrupt the development process, leading to frustration and delays as developers wait or decide to switch tasks. Organizations should shorten feedback loops by identifying areas in which development tools can be accelerated (e.g. build and test processes, development environment setup), or human hand-off processes improved. </span></p><p><span>2. </span><strong>Cognitive load </strong><span>encompasses the amount of mental processing required for a developer to perform a task. When cognitive load remains high as a result of problems such as poorly documented code or systems, developers need to devote extra time and effort to complete tasks and avoid mistakes. To improve developer experience, teams and organizations should aim to reduce cognitive load by finding ways to eliminate unnecessary hurdles in the development process. </span></p><p><span>3. </span><strong>Flow state </strong><span>is a mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment. Frequent experiences of flow state at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development. Similarly, studies have shown that developers who enjoy their work perform better and produce higher quality products. Teams and organizations should focus on creating the optimal conditions for flow state.</span></p><p>The three dimensions described above provide a foundation for designing useful measurements. We recommend selecting topics to measure across the three dimensions (e.g., automated tests, codebase complexity, and time for deep work), measuring both perceptions and workflows, and including KPIs or “North Star Metrics” to track overall outcomes. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png" width="1456" height="1084" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1084,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:4770251,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3d3f642-0ec4-4466-8008-321e6f50cbcc_7826x5824.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Developer experience must be measured by capturing developers’ perceptions as well as their workflows within their tools and processes. We recommend collecting data from both people and systems in order to gain full visibility into their software delivery processes. However, we explicitly recommend starting with surveys as a practical way to capture holistic measures quickly.</p><p>Here are some recommendations for organizations conducting surveys: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Design surveys carefully.</strong><span> Poorly designed survey questions lead to inaccurate and unreliable results. At minimum, survey questions should be based on well-defined constructs, and rigorously tested in interviews for consistent interpretation. When possible, consult experts with significant experience in survey development.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Break down results by team and persona. </strong><span>A common mistake made by organizational leaders is to focus on company-wide results instead of data broken-down by team and persona (e.g. role, tenure, seniority). However, developer experience is highly contextual and can differ radically across teams or roles. Focusing only on aggregate results can lead to overlooking problems that affect small but important populations within the company, such as mobile developers.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Compare results against benchmarks. </strong><span>Comparative analysis can help contextualize data and help drive action. For example, developer sentiment toward tech debt is commonly negative, making it difficult to identify problems or gauge their scale. But teams with lower sentiment scores than their peers and organizations with lower scores than their industry competitors flag notable opportunities for improvement.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mix in transactional surveys. </strong><span>In addition to periodic surveys, organizations can use transactional surveys to collect feedback based on specific touchpoints. For example, Platform teams can use transactional surveys to prompt developers for feedback when a specific error occurs during the installation of a CLI tool. Transactional surveys provide a continuous stream of feedback and can generate higher quality responses due to the timeliness of their posed questions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Watch out for survey fatigue. </strong><span>Many organizations struggle to sustain high participation rates in surveys over time. A lack of follow-up action commonly causes developers to feel that repeatedly responding to surveys is not a worthwhile exercise. It is therefore critical that leaders and teams follow up on surveys. While a quarterly or semi-annual survey cadence is optimal for most organizations, for some, benefits may accrue from administering surveys more frequently.</span></p></li></ul><p>That’s it for this week!
