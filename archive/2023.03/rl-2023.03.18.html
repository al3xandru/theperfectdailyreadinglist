But coordinating the schedules of a bunch of adults can be a puzzle more intimidating than the Saturday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords">New York Times Crossword</a>, so it’s nice to have options for a quiet night in with your partner, roommate, or friend. Two-player games have come a long way since checkers, backgammon, and Battleship, and today the best of them are just as complex and enthralling as any group game. We talked with experts, spent more than 25 hours researching, and played 20 different games to find the one-on-one games that most people will enjoy.</p></section><div><div><section id="table-of-contents" data-scp="removed"><header><h2>The research</h2></header><ul><li><a href="#duel-games" data-gtm-element="review_toc_link">Duel games</a></li><li><a href="#relaxing-games" data-gtm-element="review_toc_link">Relaxing games</a></li><li><a href="#complex-challenges" data-gtm-element="review_toc_link">Complex challenges</a></li><li><a href="#other-good-two-player-board-games" data-gtm-element="review_toc_link">Other good two-player board games</a></li><li><a href="#the-competition" data-gtm-element="review_toc_link">The competition</a></li><li><a href="#how-we-picked-and-tested" data-gtm-element="review_toc_link">How we picked and tested</a></li></ul></section><div id="duel-games" aria-labelledby="duel-games" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><div><p>Ideal for a pair of players who really want to test each others’ abilities, these games are much more reliant on skill than luck.

publishing, the price was $28.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><strong>How it’s played:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/42065/167248/4/147304/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon"

data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/42065/167248/4/147304/?merchant=Amazon">Hive</a> is a game of placing and moving bugs (represented by tiles) in order to surround your opponent’s queen bee. On each turn, players either place a new piece from their collection onto the table or move one they placed in a previous turn. Each piece has a unique way to move around on the table—beetles can climb on top of other pieces, ants can move anywhere they want on the outside of the played tiles (known as the hive), grasshoppers can bound over all pieces in one row—and when they move, they must not leave any other pieces stranded from the group, which the game calls “breaking the hive.” Once a player’s queen is surrounded (whether by their opponents’ pieces, their own pieces, or a combination) that player loses.</p></div><div><p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Hive has all the tactical depth of chess but without the cultural expectations that come with it. It’s a deeply strategic game that is simple to learn and play—on any one turn you can take just one of two possible actions—but it’s still deep enough to keep revealing new ways to play, even after you’ve played dozens of games. Many times in testing I’d lose (or, rarely, win) in an entirely new and unexpected way, which made me want a rematch so I could try out what I’d just learned. It also takes no time to set up; there’s no board to assemble or deck of cards to shuffle—just tiles in a bag, so you can jump right into playing.</p></div><div><p>The tiles are wonderfully tactile and clicky, and in the base version of the game they are comfortably sized and easy to pick up and hold. There’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/42064/167247/4/147305/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/42064/167247/4/147305/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/42064/167247/4/147305/?merchant=Amazon">Pocket version</a>, which comes with slightly smaller pieces, though it’s still a struggle to fit the game into most human-size pants pockets. (The Pocket version also includes two of the expansion tiles, giving you new bugs with unique move abilities to play with right off the bat.)</p></div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers: </strong>More so than the other games in this guide, Hive is a test of each player’s skill, which can be challenging for a new player facing an experienced one.

You can also try out the two factions from the Starter Set for free in the <a href="https://summonerwars.plaidhatgames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online version</a> of the game.) The decks all feature powers that are unique to that faction and encourage different play styles. For instance, the Vanguard faction prioritizes healing and boosting its units’ power, while the Fallen Kingdom can power up some of its units by sacrificing others. Players get a small supply of magic that they can use to summon units onto the board; turns consist of these summonings, unit movement, and attacks. The ultimate goal, of course, is to eliminate the other player’s summoner.</p></div><div><p><strong>Why it’s great: </strong>This game feels as tactically deep and interesting as the more elaborate war games we tested, like <a href="#other-good-two-player-board-games">Undaunted</a> or <a href="#the-competition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Memoir ’44</a>, but it requires much less time to set up and learn. The game mechanics are extremely well balanced: The magic you use to summon units onto the field can be regained only by eliminating enemy units (which can be tricky) or by discarding cards from your hand (an extremely limited resource). Each faction deck functions with an internal logic that doesn’t lock you into a specific play style. But it does reward learning the faction’s strengths and weaknesses, since understanding what makes your faction special can make strategic choices a lot simpler. And the remarkably cramped size of the grid makes unit placement and movement feel like an intricate dance, as you try to slide units to where they’ll do the most damage without getting in your own way.</p></div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers: </strong>Despite feeling cramped in terms of card movement, the grid occupies quite a large space on a table. Folks with smaller spaces, or those who like to have room for snacks and drinks on their play surface, may be annoyed at its sprawl. In addition, the Master Set box doesn’t come with any sort of organizer for the decks of cards; this means you’ll need to supply a rubber band for each deck, unless you want to spend time sorting them each time you play.</p></div><div><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 40 to 60 minutes<br/><strong>Rules:</strong> <a

data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51222/181747/4/147311/?merchant=Amazon">Star Realms</a> is a deck-building game: Players “buy” cards from a shared market to power up their decks, deal damage, and eventually eliminate their opponent. It grafts that basic system onto a wonderfully robust and interconnected world that rewards replays and accumulated game experience. You start out with a very small deck of generic economic and martial ships, but you can quickly build a fleet of bases and ships from four different factions. When you play cards from the same faction together, they gain extra power. And because all of the available ships are bought from a common market, you can keep track of what cards the other player picks up and try to foil their strategy.</p></div><div><p><strong>Why it’s great: </strong>Though the first few turns can feel underwhelming because your starting hand gives you only a few options for play, the game ramps up quickly. About 10 minutes in, you’ll suddenly find yourself buying space stations the size of planets and delivering haymakers, as you and your opponent slug it out with your increasingly powerful decks. This loop, which really ramps up once you get cards with complementary powers into your deck, gives the game a constantly escalating pace. It’s incredibly competitive, too: Every game I played in my testing ended up being a close match.

Each player gets a hand of 13 cards from the 33-card deck—the rest are set aside into a draw pile—and the goal of the game is to win tricks by playing a higher-value card than the other player. Higher value can be relative, though: Every odd-numbered card modifies the game slightly, giving you powers like switching out the trump suit or forcing the other player to play a certain card.</p></div><div><p>There’s another catch, too. You don’t want to win too many tricks, since the scoring system works on a curve. To get the most points, you’ll want to win either 0 to 3 tricks or 7 to 9 tricks. Winning 4 to 6 tricks gets you fewer points, and if you win 10 tricks or more, you get no points at all for that hand. At the end of each round, the scores are added, and the first player to get to 21 points wins.</p></div><div><p><strong>Why it’s great: </strong>The Fox in the Forest sits at the perfect intersection of luck and strategy for a quick, low-stakes game. The common trick-taking mechanic is instantly recognizable to a wide range of people, and it’s simple enough to learn for those who are unfamiliar. The game’s unique features, like the added power cards, keep the decisions interesting enough to differentiate it from those playing-card classics. It’s also easy to travel with, so it does well at a bar or on a trip.</p></div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers:</strong> The box includes a number of little cardboard pieces that are used to keep track of the overall game score, but we found them more trouble than they were worth. It was much easier to just keep score with a pen and paper.</p></div><div><h3>A quick and easy economic puzzle: Jaipur</h3></div><div><figure id="attachment_257346"><div><img loading="lazy" alt="Groups of coins and cards from Jaipur, one of our picks for best two-player board games." src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=320" data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=1024" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=1024 1024w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=1024&amp;dpr=1.5 1536w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=1024&amp;dpr=2 2048w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=980 980w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=980&amp;dpr=1.5 1470w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=980&amp;dpr=2 1960w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=768 768w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=768&amp;dpr=1.5 1152w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=768&amp;dpr=2 1536w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=480 480w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=480&amp;dpr=1.5 720w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=480&amp;dpr=2 960w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=320 320w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;dpr=1.5 480w,https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2022/06/two-player-board-game-2048px-8573.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;dpr=2 640w" width="2048" height="1365"/></div><figcaption>  <span>Photo: James Austin</span></figcaption></figure></div><div data-scp="callout"><h4 data-scp="callout_label">Our pick</h4><div id="callout-chapter-1-5" data-scp="callout_item" data-testid="callout" data-pid="51224"><span></span><div><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51224/181749/4/147303?merchant=Amazon" rel="sponsored noreferrer" target="_blank" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51224/181749/4/147303?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_image" data-scp="removed" tabindex="-1"><div><img alt="" itemprop="image" data-src="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/51224/Jaipur_20220610-161708_full.jpeg" width="570" height="380" loading="lazy" src="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/51224/Jaipur_20220610-161708_full.jpeg"/></div></a></div></div></div><div><p><strong>How to play:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51224/181749/4/147313/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51224/181749/4/147313/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51224/181749/4/147313/?merchant=Amazon">Jaipur</a> is a set collection game that has players compete to be the best trader each round. To start, players draw cards from a common row that contains both material cards (things like diamonds, gold, silver, cloth, spice, and leather) and camels (essentially a less-valuable commodity you can use for strategic purposes). This row is replenished from the deck after each draw. Every turn, you can either draw one card from the common row, trade any number of cards from the row in exchange for an equal number of cards you already hold, or sell materials for points. You can also choose to pick up all the camel cards in the market. But doing so gives your opponent a whole new row of cards to draw from, so it’s a calculated risk. Each material card has a different value, and you get extra points for selling three or more of the same material at a time.</p></div><div><p>Once three types of goods are sold out—or the market runs out of cards—the round is over. The scores are added up, and whoever has the most points from the round gets a Seal of Excellence. The player who gets two seals first wins the game.</p></div><div><p><strong>Why it’s great: </strong>Economic games have a reputation for being overly complicated or dull, but Jaipur sidesteps all of that by keeping the decisions simple and the tone light. Luck is a factor in this game, both in the supplies that hit the market during your turn and in what the goods will actually be worth (though selling early makes getting higher values more likely, which keeps decisions from feeling too make-or-break). But the game’s balance never swings so far over to the side of luck that you feel like your decisions don’t matter. It’s a constant challenge to try to pull valuable goods from the market without giving your opponent an opportunity to do the same—keeping you engaged throughout the round.</p></div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers: </strong>This game is elegant and well designed, but its skill ceiling is decidedly low. In other words, the game remains fun and light no matter how often you play, but once you’ve played through it once or twice, there’s not much more to learn or explore.</p></div><div><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 25 minutes<br/><strong>Rules:</strong> <a href="https://www.spacecowboys.fr/_files/ugd/59baa2_668d47414cf6481d97060052b7238b2d.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a></p></div></div><div id="complex-challenges" aria-labelledby="complex-challenges" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><div><p>These games are more competitive than our relaxing picks, but they’re not quite as antagonistic as our duel-game picks.

Of all our picks, this is the one that feels the most like a modern multiplayer board game, but pared down to work perfectly with two players. The game is played over the course of three rounds (or “ages,” as the game puts it). In each age, building cards are arranged into a pattern in the middle of the play surface, some faceup and others facedown. Players draft building cards and either build them in their city, discard them to earn coins, or use them to construct a wonder. Each building or wonder you have in your city not only earns you points or gold, but also provides resources that make it easier to build more and more complex buildings, earning you even more points and gold.</p></div><div><p>Having the most points at the end of the third age is just one way to win. You can also beat your opponent with military might by buying buildings that move an army piece toward the other player’s city. Or you can win a science victory by collecting six of the seven available science buildings.</p></div><div><p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> This game feels a lot bigger than the other games on our list. There are many things to keep track of, on both your own and your opponent’s side of the board, and multiple ways to win. Crucially, that abundance of options never feels overwhelming because of the game’s deliberate pacing. The wonders you select give you a target and game plan for the first two ages. But once you’ve accomplished those goals (usually near the end of the second age, in my testing), the third and final age acts as a sort of mad dash to the finish as each player uses the economic engines they’ve built to snatch up as many victory points as possible.</p></div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers:</strong> Though the game has an elegant design and isn’t too difficult to learn, it’s probably the most intimidating of our picks—at least for tabletop gaming novices—due to its various win conditions and the amount of things to keep track of. If you’re new to this kind of game, try to power through the steep learning curve, and you’ll be rewarded with a complex, replayable experience.</p></div><div><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 30

You do only one thing: place workers. But trying to figure out the best way to do that is surprisingly complicated—and fun.</p><div data-scp="removed"><h4>Buying Options</h4><p data-scp="removed">*At the time of publishing, the price was $17.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><strong>How to play:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51226/181751/4/147316/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51226/181751/4/147316/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51226/181751/4/147316/?merchant=Amazon">Targi</a> is hard to describe but surprisingly easy to learn. The field of play is a grid of 25 cards. The outer 16 are called border cards, and they’re always placed in the same order and cannot be picked up by players. The inner nine cards, which consist of tribe cards and goods cards, can be collected by placing workers (called Targis) on the border cards during each turn. Both border cards and tribe/goods cards provide actions that players can take after placing their markers. The game ends when a player collects 12 tribe cards. But since each tribe card is worth a different amount of points, the first player to 12 isn’t always the winner. These card bonuses allow for several different layers of strategy, and players also have to contend with a “Robber” that raids their supply of goods and gold at regular intervals.</p></div><div><p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> With just a few restrictions on how you can place your pawns, a game of Targi seems simple at first glance. But beneath the surface, you will find a wealth of complex decisions. Trying to acquire the tribe cards you want can be maddeningly tricky, even if the other player isn’t actively trying to block you from getting them. And since you can place Targis only on unoccupied rows and columns, the placement options narrow quickly as a round progresses. That would be a bummer in a more complicated game, but thanks to Targi’s rapid-fire pacing, you’re often already thinking about where you’re going to go on the next turn before you place your final piece of the current round.</p></div><div><p><strong>Flaws but not dealbreakers:</strong> A few times during testing, the game seemed to drag a little at the end—often because it became obvious who was going to win, and the last few turns just consisted of the victor filling out their display of cards to end the game.</p></div><div><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 40 minutes<br/><strong>Rules: </strong><a href="https://thamesandkosmos.com/manuals/full/691479_Targi%20Manual.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a></p></div></div><section id="other-good-two-player-board-games"><div><h2 aria-controls="other-good-two-player-board-games-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">Other good two-player board games</h2></div><div id="other-good-two-player-board-games-panel" aria-labelledby="other-good-two-player-board-games" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><div><p><strong>If you want a quick intro to role-playing paired with wacky dystopian fiction:</strong> Try <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51232/181757/4/147317/?merchant=Robots%20Management" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Robots Management" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51232/181757/4/147317/?merchant=Robots%20Management" data-vars-store="Robots Management" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Robots Management" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51232/181757/4/147317/?merchant=Robots%20Management">Inhuman Conditions</a>.

The structure is simple but robust, and the limited ways you can generate water (the essential resource that allows you to play cards or carry out their actions) keeps the action tense as players try to efficiently pick apart their opponent’s defenses without overextending. It’s not quite as easy to pick up as <a href="#star-realms">Star Realms</a> and not as strategically interesting as something like <a href="#summoner-wars">Summoner Wars</a>, so those are probably better options for most people. But if you like those games and are looking for a new take on that style, Radlands is a good option.</p></div><div><p><strong>If you’d prefer your war game to take place in Normandy instead of Narnia:</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51234/181759/4/147320/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51234/181759/4/147320/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51234/181759/4/147320/?merchant=Amazon">Undaunted</a> may be for you. A mix between a deck-building game and a straightforward war game, Undaunted is a fun and relatively quick experience. The different scenarios are easy to set up and well balanced—a notable advantage over the similarly themed Memoir ’44. And the command system that relies on building out your deck with different troop cards makes you feel like you have much more control over strategy. It’s similar enough to <a href="#summoner-wars">Summoner Wars</a> (which we liked slightly better in our play tests), so if you like the World War II theme better than a swords-and-sorcery one, you&#39;ll have a great time with this game.</p></div><div><p><strong>If you’ve played all of our picks and are still looking for a new challenge: </strong>It might be time to try <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51235/181760/4/147321/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51235/181760/4/147321/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51235/181760/4/147321/?merchant=Amazon">Twilight Struggle</a>. This wildly popular area-control game casts players as the two superpower protagonists of the Cold War, and it’s a fantastic example of how carefully using mechanics to explore a game’s theme can build wonderful narrative tension. Using cards that feature historical events from different periods of the war, players attempt to exert influence on other countries, win the space race, foment coups, and otherwise try to take control of the world. It’s a deep strategic game that, after a few playthroughs, has kept me thinking about new ways to win. But that depth comes at the expense of a steep learning curve and slow gameplay. The first few times you play will be a slog, as you check and recheck what each action really does, consider how the cards you’re holding might affect the different game trackers, and try desperately to figure out the best path forward. The amount of time a player needs to dedicate to learn the game before they can really find the fun is just too much for most casual players. But if you’re willing to put in the time, this one is a masterpiece of design and tactics.</p></div></div></section><div id="the-competition" aria-labelledby="the-competition" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51236/181895/4/147322/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51236/181895/4/147322/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51236/181895/4/147322/?merchant=Amazon">Air, Land, &amp; Sea</a> is a quick, card-based battle game in which players try to gain control over the three titular theaters of combat.

The players use cards to move three colors of cubes between the squares of the ever-shifting board. The cryptid player’s goal is to create a recognizable pattern using the cubes, which would expand their presence, while the scientist wants the opposite. The game’s concept and play style are unique, but unfortunately the experience never really clicked for me or anyone I played with. It’s difficult to manipulate the cubes without alerting your opponent to your plan, which they can easily squash, leading to a stalemate—which makes the very short play time feel like a slog.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51241/181766/4/147328/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51241/181766/4/147328/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51241/181766/4/147328/?merchant=Amazon">Fog of Love</a> is a role-playing experience designed to be the board game equivalent of a romantic comedy.

But Inhuman Conditions is slightly less intimidating in terms of time commitment, and its role-playing can be less emotionally fraught, so we think it’s a better game to try first.</p></div><div><p>Just like <a href="#7-wonders-duel">7 Wonders Duel</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51242/181767/4/147329/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51242/181767/4/147329/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51242/181767/4/147329/?merchant=Amazon">Imhotep: The Duel</a> is a scaled-down version of a popular multiplayer game—in this case the worker-placement game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51243/181768/4/147341/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51243/181768/4/147341/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51243/181768/4/147341/?merchant=Amazon">Imhotep</a>.

It’s a lovely dexterity game that combines magnets and reflexes, with your aim being to get a little plastic ball from your side of the board into your opponent’s goal. You do this by moving a pawn-like striker that is magnetically attached to a handle beneath the board. There are also little plastic magnets in the center of the board that can attach to your pawn and gum up the works. It’s an exciting game to play and watch, and when I brought it to a game night with three of my friends, we had a good time setting up a quick little tournament. But it’s also quite large and fairly expensive for the amount of play time most people will likely get out of it.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51245/181843/4/147331/?merchant=Walmart" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Walmart" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51245/181843/4/147331/?merchant=Walmart" data-vars-store="Walmart" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Walmart" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51245/181843/4/147331/?merchant=Walmart">Lost Cities</a> is a card game where you push your luck by funding risky expeditions into various harsh environments.

It pairs the childlike fun of playing with little green army men (plus tanks and artillery) with some of the feeling of a more involved hex-based battle game, like the <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=11" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Standard Combat Series</a>. Set in the European theater of World War II, this game is a great intro to more tactics-heavy games like <a href="#other-good-two-player-board-games">Undaunted</a>. But it takes a long time to set up (there are a <em>lot</em> of those little green army men), and it isn’t well balanced.

It’s quick and easy to play: Players move along a track laid out through a series of landscape cards, traversing them by playing matching cards from their hands. Loki cards can either advance your raven or hinder your opponent’s, but your supply is limited, so choosing how and when to play them is the game’s main difference maker. Overall, it’s a fun experience, but the gameplay is shallow, and once you’ve played a few times it loses its luster. The other card games on our list simply have more replay value.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51248/181773/4/147334/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51248/181773/4/147334/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51248/181773/4/147334/?merchant=Amazon">Onitama</a> is a quick and easy-to-learn chess-like game, with just four pawns and a king. The main difference is that instead of each piece having its own unique move, they’re controlled by cards. As you use them, these cards are passed to your opponent, so you’re in a constant push-pull as you trade moves looking to get the upper hand. It’s a quick game—my playthroughs lasted about 15 minutes—but we enjoyed the depth of <a href="#hive">Hive</a> more. On the plus side, Onitama uses a neoprene mat instead of a cardboard game board. We’d love to see more games use this, since it helps the game fit into a smaller box (when rolled up) and feels great to play on.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51249/181774/4/147335/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51249/181774/4/147335/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51249/181774/4/147335/?merchant=Amazon">Quoridor</a> (pronounced like “corridor”) is a quick abstract puzzle in which players place walls and move a pawn between them. Each player has a supply of 10 walls, with the goal of getting their pawn to the far side of the board first. On each turn, you can either move your pawn or place a wall to block your opponent. This mechanic means the game goes from friendly to mean very quickly, and the simple concept makes it easy to teach and fun to play—at first, anyway. Unfortunately, we found that that simplicity meant the shine wore off quickly after a few plays.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51250/181775/4/147336/?merchant=Amazon" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51250/181775/4/147336/?merchant=Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-gtm-element="product_link_impression" data-link-type="link" data-merchant="Amazon" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/51250/181775/4/147336/?merchant=Amazon">Rivals for Catan</a> is a two-player card game set in the world of the wildly popular Catan.

	<p>&#34;I am not even sure we can call it a watch.&#34;</p>

<p>Ben Clymer wrote those words about the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hodinkee-apple-watch-review" target="_blank">a little over eight years ago</a> when the very first generation of the category-leading smartwatch was revealed. A lot has changed for Apple Watch since then, but the initial ambiguity is just as relevant as ever. People are, somehow, still fighting about this. </p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="2">
	<p>The Apple Watch is a device that can save your life, keep you healthy, and help you communicate with others. Traditional timekeeping seems quaint by comparison, though of course it can do that too. </p>

	<p>The Apple Watch Series 8 goes on sale today, and I&#39;ve spent the past week testing it out. Series 8 is, in many ways, an iterative release for the flagship smartwatch, and its debut was largely overshadowed by the announcement of the heavy-duty Apple Watch Ultra (review coming soon). The Ultra is a big deal for Apple, but the Series 8 will be the most versatile option for most people.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="5">
	<p>In many ways, Apple Watch Series 8 is identical to last year&#39;s Series 7. It comes in either 45mm or 41mm, with either a stainless steel or aluminum case, and all options feature the always-on display that was first added with Apple Watch Series 5. </p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="6">
	<p>So let&#39;s focus on what&#39;s new. There are three updates to the Apple Watch Series 8 that strike at three of the smartwatch&#39;s core abilities: safety, health and wellness, and battery life.</p>

	<p>The headlining safety feature is an algorithm that detects car crashes and will contact emergency services for you if you are unconscious or trapped and unable to dismiss the initial warning notification. I was in a pretty nasty wreck at the start of 2021, and it&#39;s not something I&#39;d like to experience again, so I&#39;m happy to report that I was not able to test this feature out. But I think we can all agree it&#39;s more useful than a moonphase complication, however charming those may be. </p>

	<p>The car crash detection mode is enabled by the addition of a new motion sensor that includes an accelerometer. The accelerometer can detect up to 256 Gs and has a sampling rate that is four times faster than the one found in previous Apple Watch generations. Apple tested the watch in professional crash test labs (just like you see in car commercials), placing the watch on the wrist of the crash test dummies (better them than me!). </p>

	<p>In addition to the updated accelerometer, other existing Apple Watch sensors have been optimized to help in crash detection. The barometer can detect cabin pressure changes such as when an airbag is deployed, the microphone is able to detect sudden increases in decibel level such as screeching tires and crunching metal, and the GPS is able to detect sudden deceleration or changes in direction.</p>

	The All-New Body Temperature Sensor Prioritizes Wellness And Privacy
</p>

        </div>
        <div data-index="14">
	<p>The addition of a temperature sensor has been one of the peskiest and longest-running rumors surrounding each successive addition of the Apple Watch. And with Series 8, we finally have it. </p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="15">
	<p>There are actually two temperature sensors placed within the watch: one on the caseback underneath the back crystal and another underneath the front-facing dial. As of right now, the  sensors are fairly narrow in scope. As currently constructed, the sensors won&#39;t flag when you have a fever; instead they&#39;re optimized for tracking women&#39;s health. They&#39;re able to provide an estimate of a completed menstrual cycle for a woman, when combined with Apple Watch&#39;s heart-rate tracking capability. The sensors also track nightly shifts in wrist temperature when a wearer is sleeping, and will send a notification surrounding any abnormal nighttime temperatures.</p>

	<p>My perspective is fairly limited here, but overall, I think this is a great addition to Apple Watch&#39;s health and wellness abilities, and I particularly appreciate Apple&#39;s continued emphasis on privacy. My understanding is that Apple Watch Series 8 is the only wearable device with cycle tracking to offer end-to-end encryption via Apple&#39;s Health app. That means only the end user has access to their personal compiled health data; Apple is unable to view or share anything.</p>

	Low Power Mode Has Been A Long Time Coming
</p>

        </div>
        <div data-index="20">
	<p>Apart from disposability, the most common source of criticism for any smartwatch or wearable device is the low power reserve. A smartwatch has to return to the power cord and wall socket night after night to receive a renewed lease on life, all while our mechanical and quartz watches continue to tick. That doesn&#39;t necessarily change on Apple Watch Series 8, but Apple is introducing a new Low Power Mode that helps things a bit more.</p>

	<p>Apple Watch Series 8 has a standard &#34;all-day&#34; battery life of 18 hours, where you can text, take calls, and run GPS to your heart&#39;s content. But when you engage the new Low Power Mode ability, Apple Watch Series 8 has an increased lifespan of 36 hours. The bad news is that when Low Power Mode is kicked on, you do end up losing the always-on display and background health monitoring, but you&#39;ll be able to keep track of the time or make any potential emergency phone calls for a much longer period.</p>

	<p>Low Power Mode is definitely a helpful development that we&#39;ve been waiting on for quite some time, but I don&#39;t think it will be a game-changer for the Apple Watch in the way something like solar-charging would be. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Low Power Mode is a welcome start in keeping the Apple Watch on people&#39;s wrists and off the charger, but I don&#39;t think Switzerland has to worry about people throwing away their mechanical watches just yet.</p>

	<p>It is worth mentioning that the charging time for an Apple Watch is remarkably quick; if you&#39;re using an Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter, it will take approximately 45 minutes to hit 80 percent and around 75 minutes to reach full charge on Apple Watch Series 8.</p>

        <div data-index="28">
	<p>WatchOS 9 includes other cool attributes, including the updated Compass app with &#34;Backtrack&#34; capability that allows you to drop waypoints while hiking.

	<p>I played around with the new Compass app while walking around Lower Manhattan near the HODINKEE office and really enjoyed the updated user experience and navigation. I&#39;m excited to take it out into the woods in the near future to give it a spin in an area that isn&#39;t defined by a street grid.</p>

	<p>Over the last eight years, Apple Watch has changed the narrative surrounding what a watch can be. I think it&#39;s hard to argue that it hasn&#39;t had a comprehensive impact on how humanity views what is on their wrist; because of Apple Watch, more people than ever before are using a so-called &#34;watch&#34; as a tool for work and for pleasure, for travel and for communication. </p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="33">
	<p>So, to return to Ben&#39;s initial hesitancy in 2014: Is the Apple Watch a watch? At this point, I think there&#39;s only one answer: It&#39;s a watch if that&#39;s what you want it to be, but it can also be so much more.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="34">
	<p>The Apple Watch Series 8 is officially available today. As is custom, it&#39;s available in two price points, with GPS-equipped models starting at $399 and the GPS+Cellular models available for $499 and above. The Apple Watch Series 8 is focused primarily on small improvements, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &#34;must&#34; upgrade if you&#39;re already an Apple Watch owner. But if you&#39;re in the market to upgrade or are a first-time buyer, it&#39;s still the best smartwatch for daily living that money can buy.</p>

		<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The question authors fear most ... Neil tackles it here.</p><div><p>
	Every profession has its pitfalls. Doctors, for example, are always being asked for free medical advice, lawyers are asked for legal information, morticians are told how interesting a profession that must be and then people change the subject fast. And writers are asked where we get our ideas from.
	</p><p>
	In the beginning, I used to tell people the not very funny answers, the flip ones: &#39;From the Idea-of-the-Month Club,&#39; I&#39;d say, or &#39;From a little ideas shop in Bognor Regis,&#39; &#39;From a dusty old book full of ideas in my basement,&#39; or even &#39;From Pete Atkins.&#39; (The last is slightly esoteric, and may need a little explanation. Pete Atkins is a screenwriter and novelist friend of mine, and we decided a while ago that when asked, I would say that I got them from him, and he&#39;d say he got them from me. It seemed to make sense at the time.)
	</p><p>
	Then I got tired of the not very funny answers, and these days I tell people the truth:
	</p><p>
	&#39;I make them up,&#39; I tell them. &#39;Out of my head.&#39;
	</p><p>
	People don&#39;t like this answer. I don&#39;t know why not. They look unhappy, as if I&#39;m trying to slip a fast one past them. As if there&#39;s a huge secret, and, for reasons of my own, I&#39;m not telling them how it&#39;s done.
	</p><p>
	And of course I&#39;m not. Firstly, I don&#39;t know myself where the ideas really come from, what makes them come, or whether one day they&#39;ll stop. Secondly, I doubt anyone who asks really wants a three hour lecture on the creative process. And thirdly, the ideas aren&#39;t that important. Really they aren&#39;t. Everyone&#39;s got an idea for a book, a movie, a story, a TV series.
	</p><p>
	Every published writer has had it - the people who come up to you and tell you that they&#39;ve Got An Idea. And boy, is it a Doozy. It&#39;s such a Doozy that they want to Cut You In On It. The proposal is always the same - they&#39;ll tell you the Idea (the hard bit), you write it down and turn it into a novel (the easy bit), the two of you can split the money fifty-fifty.
	</p><p>
	I&#39;m reasonably gracious with these people. I tell them, truly, that I have far too many ideas for things as it is, and far too little time. And I wish them the best of luck.
	</p><p>
	The Ideas aren&#39;t the hard bit. They&#39;re a small component of the whole. Creating believable people who do more or less what you tell them to is much harder. And hardest by far is the process of simply sitting down and putting one word after another to construct whatever it is you&#39;re trying to build: making it interesting, making it new.
	</p><p>
	But still, it&#39;s the question people want to know. In my case, they also want to know if I get them from my dreams. (Answer: no. Dream logic isn&#39;t story logic. Transcribe a dream, and you&#39;ll see. Or better yet, tell someone an important dream - &#39;Well, I was in this house that was also my old school, and there was this nurse and she was really an old witch and then she went away but there was a leaf and I couldn&#39;t look at it and I knew if I touched it then something dreadful would happen...&#39; - and watch their eyes glaze over.) And I don&#39;t give straight answers. Until recently.
	</p><p>
	My daughter Holly, who is seven years of age, persuaded me to come in to give a talk to her class. Her teacher was really enthusiastic (&#39;The children have all been making their own books recently, so perhaps you could come along and tell them about being a professional writer. And lots of little stories. They like the stories.&#39;) and in I came.
	</p><p>
	They sat on the floor, I had a chair, fifty seven-year-old-eyes gazed up at me. &#39;When I was your age, people told me not to make things up,&#39; I told them. &#39;These days, they give me money for it.&#39; For twenty minutes I talked, then they asked questions.
	</p><p>
	And eventually one of them asked it.
	</p><p>
	&#39;Where do you get your ideas?&#39;
	</p><p>
	And I realized I owed them an answer. They weren&#39;t old enough to know any better. And it&#39;s a perfectly reasonable question, if you aren&#39;t asked it weekly.
	</p><p>
	This is what I told them:
	</p><p>
	You get ideas from daydreaming. You get ideas from being bored. You get ideas all the time. The only difference between writers and other people is we notice when we&#39;re doing it.
	</p><p>
	You get ideas when you ask yourself simple questions. The most important of the questions is just, What if...?
	</p><p>
	(What if you woke up with wings? What if your sister turned into a mouse? What if you all found out that your teacher was planning to eat one of you at the end of term - but you didn&#39;t know who?)
	</p><p>
	Another important question is, If only...
	</p><p>
	(If only real life was like it is in Hollywood musicals. If only I could shrink myself small as a button. If only a ghost would do my homework.)
	</p><p>
	And then there are the others: I wonder... (&#39;I wonder what she does when she&#39;s alone...&#39;) and If This Goes On... (&#39;If this goes on telephones are going to start talking to each other, and cut out the middleman...&#39;) and Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if... (&#39;Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if the world used to be ruled by cats?&#39;)...
	</p><p>
	Those questions, and others like them, and the questions they, in their turn, pose (&#39;Well, if cats used to rule the world, why don&#39;t they any more? And how do they feel about that?&#39;) are one of the places ideas come from.
	</p><p>
	An idea doesn&#39;t have to be a plot notion, just a place to begin creating. Plots often generate themselves when one begins to ask oneself questions about whatever the starting point is.
	</p><p>
	Sometimes an idea is a person (&#39;There&#39;s a boy who wants to know about magic&#39;). Sometimes it&#39;s a place (&#39;There&#39;s a castle at the end of time, which is the only place there is...&#39;). Sometimes it&#39;s an image (&#39;A woman, sifting in a dark room filled with empty faces.&#39;)
	</p><p>
	Often ideas come from two things coming together that haven&#39;t come together before. (&#39;If a person bitten by a werewolf turns into a wolf what would happen if a goldfish was bitten by a werewolf? What would happen if a chair was bitten by a werewolf?&#39;)
	</p><p>
	All fiction is a process of imagining: whatever you write, in whatever genre or medium, your task is to make things up convincingly and interestingly and new.
	</p><p>
	And when you&#39;ve an idea - which is, after all, merely something to hold on to as you begin - what then?
	</p><p>
	Well, then you write. You put one word after another until it&#39;s finished - whatever it is.
	</p><p>
	Sometimes it won&#39;t work, or not in the way you first imagined. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t work at all. Sometimes you throw it out and start again.
	</p><p>
	I remember, some years ago, coming up with a perfect idea for a Sandman story. It was about a succubus who gave writers and artists and songwriters ideas in exchange for some of their lives. I called it Sex and Violets.
	</p><p>
	It seemed a straightforward story, and it was only when I came to write it I discovered it was like trying to hold fine sand: every time I thought I&#39;d got hold of it, it would trickle through my fingers and vanish.
	</p><p>
	I wrote at the time:
	</p><p>
	I&#39;ve started this story twice, now, and got about half-way through it each time, only to watch it die on the screen.
	</p><p>
	Sandman is, occasionally, a horror comic. But nothing I&#39;ve written for it has ever gotten under my skin like this story I&#39;m now going to have to wind up abandoning (with the deadline already a thing of the past). Probably because it cuts so close to home. It&#39;s the ideas - and the ability to put them down on paper, and turn them into stories - that make me a writer. That mean I don&#39;t have to get up early in the morning and sit on a train with people I don&#39;t know, going to a job I despise.
	</p><p>
	My idea of hell is a blank sheet of paper. Or a blank screen. And me, staring at it, unable to think of a single thing worth saying, a single character that people could believe in, a single story that hasn&#39;t been told before.
	</p><p>
	Staring at a blank sheet of paper.
	</p><p>
	Forever.

	I wrote my way out of it, though. I got desperate (that&#39;s another flip and true answer I give to the where-do-you-get-your-ideas question. &#39;Desperation.&#39; It&#39;s up there with &#39;Boredom&#39; and &#39;Deadlines&#39;. All these answers are true to a point.) and took my own terror, and the core idea, and crafted a story called Calliope, which explains, I think pretty definitively, where writers get their ideas from. It&#39;s in a book called DREAM COUNTRY. You can read it if you like. And, somewhere in the writing of that story, I stopped being scared of the ideas going away.
