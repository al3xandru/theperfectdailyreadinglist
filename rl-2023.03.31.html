      <p data-substack-content=""><em><strong>To our veteran subscribers—and to our many newcomers—welcome, again, to <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/welcome-to-the-free-press">The Free Press</a> (formerly Common Sense). We’re so excited you’re here.</strong></em></p><p data-substack-content=""><em><strong>If you haven’t yet been introduced to our columnist Walter Kirn—author of eight books, including “Up in the Air”—we think the essay below is a good place to start. </strong></em></p><p data-substack-content=""><em><strong>For more of Walter, read his essay <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-holy-anarchy-of-fun">The Holy Anarchy of Fun</a>, or <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/there-is-no-such-thing-as-ai-art">this one on A.I. art</a>. And thank you for making our work possible.</strong></em></p><p data-substack-content=""><em><strong>— BW</strong></em></p><p data-substack-content="">About five years ago, for seven dollars, I bought an old citrus juicer at a thrift shop.  It was one of those vintage small appliances which seem built to survive gas explosions and hammer attacks. When I turned on the motor with a metal toggle switch, a drive shaft spun a heavy ceramic knob that gouged out the hearts of lemon and orange halves, leaving not a scrap of pulp uncrushed. The thing worked beautifully, almost like new, so I looked up its serial number on the internet to see when the unit was manufactured, guessing it might be almost 40 years old. </p><p data-substack-content="">Wrong. It dated to the 1940s. It was 70, the stubborn monster, still giving satisfaction with every use.</p><p data-substack-content="">I can’t say the same about my coffee grinders. I use the plural because I’ve owned a lot of them, all bought in their original packaging and dead within a year. They’re good ones, supposedly, with burrs not blades, but they stop performing before long, ending their long journeys from overseas factories in unmarked graves in my local Montana landfill. </p><p data-substack-content="">I have a whole ghost kitchen in this landfill, and soon I will need to reserve a bigger plot. For the nifty under-the-counter fridge that has stopped getting cold after three years and no one in the area can fix. For the cool, bagless vacuum cleaner that clogs and chokes when I run it over a rug. For the set of glass measuring cups whose numbers and hash marks are swiftly fading and becoming illegible, much like those on the dials of the washer my wife bought just three years ago. For the remains of the Pyrex casserole that shattered when I removed it from the oven, strewing the floor with blade-like shards, some so tiny I probably won’t find them for another couple of months, and only when they lodge in my bare feet. </p><p data-substack-content="">Should I go on? I think I will. It’s important to get to the essayistic part, where I ask what it means when the objects in our lives demoralize us in a blizzard of malfunctions that seem to be hastening by the month. But it’s also important—to me, emotionally—to bury the reader in details of the unceasing material disappointments I’ve faced. Disappointments of the sort we will all be facing en masse in a few days. Merry Christmas!</p><p data-substack-content="">Like the cute yellow mittens my wife picked up at Target which unraveled the second time she wore them. Or the new suitcase which won’t stand upright when it’s full. The laptop computers that have turned to bricks within months of their warranties expiring. And the hybrid sedan with 50,000 miles on it that also turned into a brick while going eighty down the freeway, losing its power steering, its power brakes, its power everything. I survived, by some miracle, issued legal threats, and the car’s manufacturer repaired it, free. Then it bricked again a few weeks later.</p><p data-substack-content="">It’s the little things too, of course, because they’re constant. The staples that won’t pierce five stacked sheets of paper. The matches that sizzle and smoke but won’t catch fire. The grocery bags split by the corners of the milk cartons whose inadequate seals leak drops. The strangely short power cords on electronics. The two or three new pens I use each week that, because no ink comes out of them (at least not continuously, in lines) aren’t really pens at all, in fact, but tributes to pens. Potemkin pens, mere props. </p><p data-substack-content="">Baffled by how to measure this decline in the quality of common wares—a decline whose significance I promise to cover once I’ve further gratified my rage—I opened the matter to my Twitter audience and quickly garnered more than 2,000 replies, by far the longest thread I’ve ever triggered. The complaints were specific and formed patterns. One was a loathing for newer washers and dryers because they don’t wash or dry well, and then they break. The clothes that go inside them were disliked, too. (A former top executive of Levi’s chimed in to confirm that jeans aren’t what they used to be.) </p><p data-substack-content="">My favorite replies were the picky ones. One person noted that the “juice content” of juice is going down. Another observed that the “foaming liquid hand soap” which suddenly is dominating store shelves is really just normal liquid soap, diluted.</p><p data-substack-content="">Many blamed these problems on the government. They believed it had crippled certain products (major home appliances, especially) with environmental regulations, causing them to function poorly and turn rapidly to landfill fodder—an ecological net loss, perhaps. Some folks blamed our trade agreements with China and the evils of capitalism itself. Weak-link computer chips in items that don’t require them also came in for abuse. One highly philosophical reply spoke of a sinister general trend toward the degradation of everything human. “There’s a war on value that’s going that’s comprised of three parts: war on quality, war on money, war on life.” Lofty rhetoric, but I understood. When my suddenly de-electrified hybrid car became a hurtling giant stone inside which my wife and I were helplessly strapped—all for the crime of trying to save fuel and, ultimately, earth—it was hard not to feel tricked. </p><p data-substack-content="">Only a couple of my correspondents challenged my premise—and the flood of testimony—that stuff is getting crappier, and acutely so. They made an economic argument. They claimed things are worse because we want them cheaper, but if price is adjusted for inflation, they’re of the same quality as always. These rant-killing sophisticates annoyed me. Our new washing machine with the faded dials and the vanishing enamel on its corners (I forgot to mention that defect) is the costliest model we’ve ever purchased. As for the much of the cheap stuff—those Target mittens, say—they aren’t merely inexpensive, they’re valueless. In fact, they’re of negative value when one considers the waste of materials involved, and the wasted energy of driving to buy them, then driving to return them later—a second trip that, in this case and many others, wasn’t worth making. Instead, we took the loss. And the world took the loss. A small one, but they add up.</p><p data-substack-content="">In England in the 19th century there arose certain thinkers—John Ruskin, William Morris—who believed that the quality of material objects reflects and affects the quality of society, even of the spirit. “Have nothing in your home,” wrote Morris, the father of the Arts and Crafts movement, which aimed to elevate the lives of the working and middle classes, “that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.” This would be a tall order nowadays. </p><p data-substack-content="">Recently, my wife needed a carrot peeler. She needed one rather quickly. Off to Target. The one she bought (the only one on sale) looked handsome enough, and the brand was one she recognized, but it failed in the useful department, miserably. It wasn’t sharp enough to peel a carrot. Like my pens which aren’t pens because pens put ink on paper, her peeler which didn’t peel was a nullity, a simulacrum, a representation of something, not the thing. </p><p data-substack-content="">The world is going digital, we’re told, and someday there will even be digital real estate inhabited by people in digital clothes drinking digital orange juice extracted with digital juicers.  People will play at the lives they once took seriously, lives that had once had heft and weight, and the juice content of juice will fall to zero. I suspect my old physical squeezer will still be working then, but the rest of my kitchen gear won’t. Not much of it. I might not last, either. I fear I won’t. The psychic toll of goods that don’t endure is that one loses faith the future will even come, and then one loses interest in it coming, for little that we own or use or cherish seems likely to be there with us to meet it. </p><p data-substack-content="">One wonders whose obsolescence is being planned—our products’, our belongings’, or our own? %%%</p>

<p>This article will teach you about some not famous but useful Java libraries. This is the second article in the “useful &amp; unknown” series. The previous one described several attractive, but not well-known Java features. You can read more about it <a href="https://piotrminkowski.com/2022/01/05/useful-unknown-java-features/">here</a>.<span id="more-13954"></span></p>



<p>Today we will focus on Java libraries. Usually, we use several external libraries in our projects – even if we do not include them directly. For example, Spring Boot comes with a defined set of dependencies included by starters. Assuming we include e.g. <code>spring-boot-starter-test</code> we include libraries like <code>mockito</code>, <code>junit-jupiter</code> or <code>hamcrest</code> at the same time. Of course, these are well-known libraries for the community. </p>



<p>In fact, there are a lot of different Java libraries. Usually, I don’t need to use many of them (or even I need none of them) when working with the frameworks like Spring Boot or Quarkus. However, there are some very interesting libraries that may be useful everywhere. I’m writing about them because you might not hear about any of them. I’m going to introduce 5 of my favorite “useful &amp; unknown” Java libraries. Let’s begin!</p>







<h2>Source Code</h2>



<p>If you would like to try it by yourself, you may always take a look at my source code. To do that you need to clone my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/piomin/spring-boot-tips.git">repository</a>. Yo can also find the example  Then you should just follow my instructions.</p>







<h2>Instancio</h2>



<p>On the first fire will go <a href="https://www.instancio.org/">Instancio</a>. How do you generate test data in your unit tests? Instancio will help us with that. It aims to reduce the time and lines of code spent on manual data setup in unit tests. It instantiates and populates objects with random data, making our tests more dynamic. We can generate random data with Instancio but at the same, we can set custom data in a particular field.</p>



<p>Before we start with Instancio, let’s discuss our data model. Here’s the first class – <code>Person</code>:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Person {

   private Long id;
   private String name;
   private int age;
   private Gender gender;
   private Address address;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Our class contains three simple fields (<code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>), a single enum <code>Gender</code> , and the instance of the <code>Address</code> class. Gender is just a simple enum containing <code>MALE</code> and <code>FEMALE</code> values. Here’s the implementation of the <code>Address</code> class:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Address {

   private String country;
   private String city;
   private String street;
   private int houseNumber;
   private int flatNumber;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Now, let’s create a test to check whether the <code>Person</code> service will successfully add and obtain objects from the store. We want to generate random data for all the fields except the <code>id</code> field, which is set by the service. Here’s our test:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Test
void addAndGet() {
   Person person = Instancio.of(Person.class)
             .ignore(Select.field(Person::getId))
             .create();
   person = personService.addPerson(person);
   Assertions.assertNotNull(person.getId());
   person = personService.findById(person.getId());
   Assertions.assertNotNull(person);
   Assertions.assertNotNull(person.getAddress());
}</code></pre>







<p>The values generated for my test run are visible below. As you see, the <code>id</code> field equals <code>null</code>. Other fields contain random values generated per the field type (<code>String</code> or <code>int</code>).</p>



<pre><code lang="json">Person(id=null, name=ATDLCA, age=2619, gender=MALE, 
address=Address(country=FWOFRNT, city=AIRICCHGGG, street=ZZCIJDZ, houseNumber=5530, flatNumber=1671))</code></pre>







<p>Let’s see how we can generate several objects with Instancio. Assuming we need 5 objects in the list for our test, we can do that in the following way. We will also set a constant value for the <code>city</code> fields inside the <code>Address</code> object. Then we would like to test the method for searching objects by the city name.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Test
void addListAndGet() {
   final int numberOfObjects = 5;
   final String city = &#34;Warsaw&#34;;
   List&lt;Person&gt; persons = Instancio.ofList(Person.class)
           .size(numberOfObjects)
           .set(Select.field(Address::getCity), city)
           .create();
   personService.addPersons(persons);
   persons = personService.findByCity(city);
   Assertions.assertEquals(numberOfObjects, persons.size());
}</code></pre>







<p>Let’s take a look at the last example. The same as before, we are generating a list of objects – this time 100. We can easily specify the additional criteria for generated values. For example, I would like to set a value for the <code>age</code> field between 18 and 65.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Test
void addGeneratorAndGet() {
   List&lt;Person&gt; persons = Instancio.ofList(Person.class)
            .size(100)
            .ignore(Select.field(Person::getId))
            .generate(Select.field(Person::getAge), 
                      gen -&gt; gen.ints().range(18, 65))
            .create();
   personService.addPersons(persons);
   persons = personService.findAllGreaterThanAge(40);
   Assertions.assertTrue(persons.size() &gt; 0);
}</code></pre>







<p>That’s just a small set of customizations, that Instancio offers, for test data generation. You can read more about other options in their <a href="https://www.instancio.org/user-guide/#project-goals">docs</a>.</p>







<h2>Datafaker</h2>



<p>The next library we will discuss today is <a href="https://www.datafaker.net/">Datafaker</a>. The purpose of this library is quite similar to the previous one. We need to generate random data. However, this time we need data that looks like real data. From my perspective, it is useful for demo presentations or examples running somewhere. </p>



<p>Datafaker creates fake data for your JVM programs within minutes, using our wide range of more than 100 data providers. This can be very helpful when generating test data to fill a database, generating data for a stress test, or anonymizing data from production services. Let’s include it in our dependencies.</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;net.datafaker&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;datafaker&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.7.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>We will expand our sample model a little. Here’s a new class definition. The Contact class contains two fields <code>email</code> and <code>phoneNumber</code>. We will validate both these fields using the <code>jakarta.validation</code> module.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Contact {

   @Email
   private String email;
   @Pattern(regexp=&#34;\\d{2}-\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}&#34;)
   private String phoneNumber;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Here’s a new version of our <code>Person</code> class that contains the <code>Contant</code> object instance:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">public class Person {

   private Long id;
   private String name;
   private int age;
   private Gender gender;
   private Address address;
   @Valid
   private Contact contact;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>Now, let’s generate fake data for the <code>Person</code> object. We can create localized data just by setting the Locale object in the Faker constructor <strong>(1)</strong>. For me, it is Poland 🙂 There are a lot of providers for the standard values. To set <code>email</code> we need to use the <code>Internet</code> provider <strong>(2)</strong>. There is a dedicated provider for generating phone numbers <strong>(3)</strong>, addresses <strong>(4)</strong>, and person names <strong>(5)</strong>. You can see a full list of available providers <a href="https://www.datafaker.net/documentation/providers/">here</a>. After creating test data, we can run the test that adds a new <code>Person</code> verified on the server side.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class PersonsControllerTests {

   @Autowired
   private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

   @Test
   void add() {
      Faker faker = new Faker(Locale.of(&#34;pl&#34;)); // (1)
      Contact contact = new Contact();
      contact.setEmail(faker.internet().emailAddress()); // (2)
      contact.setPhoneNumber(faker.phoneNumber().cellPhone()); // (3)
      Address address = new Address();
      address.setCity(faker.address().city()); // (4)
      address.setCountry(faker.address().country());
      address.setStreet(faker.address().streetName());
      int number = Integer
         .parseInt(faker.address().streetAddressNumber());
      address.setHouseNumber(number);
      number = Integer.parseInt(faker.address().buildingNumber());
      address.setFlatNumber(number);
      Person person = new Person();
      person.setName(faker.name().fullName()); // (5)
      person.setContact(contact);
      person.setAddress(address);
      person.setGender(Gender.valueOf(
         faker.gender().binaryTypes().toUpperCase()));
      person.setAge(faker.number().numberBetween(18, 65));

      person = restTemplate
         .postForObject(&#34;/persons&#34;, person, Person.class);
      Assertions.assertNotNull(person);
      Assertions.assertNotNull(person.getId());
   }

}</code></pre>







<p>Here’s the data generated during my test. I think you can find one inconsistency here (the <code>country</code> field) 😉</p>



<pre><code lang="json">Person(id=null, name=Stefania Borkowski, age=51, gender=FEMALE, address=Address(country=Ekwador, city=Sępopol, street=al. Chudzik, houseNumber=882, flatNumber=318), contact=Contact{email=&#39;gilbert.augustyniak@gmail.com&#39;, phoneNumber=&#39;69-733-43-77&#39;})</code></pre>







<p>Sometimes you need to generate a more predictable random result. It’s possible to provide a seed value in the Faker constructor. When providing a seed, the instantiation of Fake objects will always happen in a predictable way, which can be handy for generating results multiple times. Here’s a new version of my <code>Faker</code> object declaration:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">Faker faker = new Faker(Locale.of(&#34;pl&#34;), new Random(0));</code></pre>







<h2>JPA Streamer</h2>



<p>Our next library is related to JPA queries. If you like to use Java streams and you are building apps that interact with databases through JPA or Hibernate, the <a href="https://jpastreamer.org/">JPA Streamer</a> library may be an interesting choice. It is a library for expressing JPA/Hibernate/Spring queries using standard Java streams. JPA Streamer instantly gives Java developers type-safe, expressive and intuitive means of obtaining data in database applications. Moreover, you can easily integrate it with Spring Boot and <a href="https://code.quarkus.io/?extension-search=origin:other%20jpastreamer">Quarkus</a>. Firstly, let’s include JPA Streamer in our dependencies:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.speedment.jpastreamer&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jpastreamer-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>If you want to integrate it with Spring Boot you need to add one additional dependency:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.speedment.jpastreamer.integration.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-jpastreamer-autoconfigure&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>In order to test JPA Streamer, we need to create an example entities model. </p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Entity
public class Employee {

   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Integer id;
   private String name;
   private String position;
   private int salary;
   @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private Department department;
   @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private Organization organization;

   // getters and setters ...

}</code></pre>







<p>There are also two other entities: <code>Organization</code> and <code>Department</code>. Here are their definitions:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Entity
public class Department {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Integer id;
   private String name;
   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &#34;department&#34;)
   private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employees;
   @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
   private Organization organization;

   // getters and setters ...
}

@Entity
public class Organization {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private Integer id;
   private String name;
   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &#34;organization&#34;)
   private Set&lt;Department&gt; departments;
   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &#34;organization&#34;)
   private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employees;

   // getters and setters ...
}</code></pre>







<p>Now, we can prepare some queries using the Java streams pattern. In the following fragment of code, we are searching an entity by id and then joining two relations. By default, it is LEFT JOIN, but we can customize it when calling the <code>joining()</code> method. In the following fragment of code, we join <code>Department</code> and <code>Organization</code>, which are in <code>@ManyToOne</code> a relationship with the Employee entity. Then we filter the result, convert the object to the DTO and pick the first result.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@GetMapping(&#34;/{id}&#34;)
public EmployeeWithDetailsDTO findById(@PathVariable(&#34;id&#34;) Integer id) {
   return streamer.stream(of(Employee.class)
           .joining(Employee$.department)
           .joining(Employee$.organization))
        .filter(Employee$.id.equal(id))
        .map(EmployeeWithDetailsDTO::new)
        .findFirst()
        .orElseThrow();
}</code></pre>







<p>Of course, we can call many other Java stream methods. In the following fragment of code, we count the number of employees assigned to the particular department.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@GetMapping(&#34;/{id}/count-employees&#34;)
public long getNumberOfEmployees(@PathVariable(&#34;id&#34;) Integer id) {
   return streamer.stream(Department.class)
         .filter(Department$.id.equal(id))
         .map(Department::getEmployees)
         .mapToLong(Set::size)

<p>If you are looking for a detailed explanation and more examples with JPA Streamer you can my <a href="https://piotrminkowski.com/2021/07/13/express-jpa-queries-as-java-streams/">article</a> dedicated to that topic.</p>







<h2>Blaze Persistence</h2>



<p><a href="https://persistence.blazebit.com/">Blaze Persistence</a> is another library from the JPA and Hibernate area. It allows you to write complex queries with a consistent builder API with rich Criteria API for JPA providers. That’s not all. You can also use the Entity-View module dedicated to DTO mapping. Of course, you can easily integrate with Spring Boot or Quarkus. If you want to use all Blaze Persistence modules in your app it is worth adding the <code>dependencyManagement</code> section in your Maven <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-bom&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.6.8&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;import&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;    
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</code></pre>







<p>Personally, I’m using Blaze Persistence for DTO mapping. Thanks to the integration with Spring Boot we can replace Spring Data Projections with Blaze Persistence Entity-Views. It will be especially useful for more advanced mappings since Blaze Persistence offers more features and better performance for that. You can read a detailed comparison in the following <a href="https://modern-sql.com/blog/2020-09/blaze-persistence">article</a>. If we want to integrate Blaze Persistence Entity-Views with Spring Data we should add the following dependencies:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-integration-spring-data-2.7&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-integration-hibernate-5.6&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.blazebit&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;blaze-persistence-entity-view-processor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>Then, we need to create an interface with getters for mapped fields. It should be annotated with the <code>@EntityView</code> that refers to the target entity class. In the following example, we are mapping two entity fields <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> to the single fields inside the <code>PersonDTO</code> object. In order to map the entity’s primary key we should use the <code>@IdMapping</code> annotation.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@EntityView(Person.class)
public interface PersonView {

   @IdMapping
   Integer getId();
   void setId(Integer id);

   @Mapping(&#34;CONCAT(firstName,&#39; &#39;,lastName)&#34;)
   String getName();
   void setName(String name);

}</code></pre>







<p>We can still take advantage of the Spring Data repository pattern. Our repository interface needs to extend the <code>EntityViewRepository</code> interface.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public interface PersonViewRepository 
    extends EntityViewRepository&lt;PersonView, Integer&gt; {

    PersonView findByAgeGreaterThan(int age);

}</code></pre>







<p>We also need to provide some additional configuration and enable Blaze Persistence in the main or the configuration class:</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBlazeRepositories
@EnableEntityViews
public class PersonApplication {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(PersonApplication.class, args);
   }

}</code></pre>







<h2>Hoverfly</h2>



<p>Finally, the last of the Java libraries on my list – <a href="https://hoverfly.io/">Hoverfly</a>. To be more precise, we will use the Java version of the Hoverfly library documented <a href="https://docs.hoverfly.io/projects/hoverfly-java/en/latest/">here</a>. It is a lightweight service virtualization tool that allows you to stub or simulate HTTP(S) services. <strong>Hoverfly Java</strong> is a native language binding that gives you an expressive API for managing Hoverfly in Java. It gives you a Hoverfly class which abstracts away the binary and API calls, a DSL for creating simulations, and a JUnit integration for using it within unit tests.</p>



<p>Ok, there are some other, similar libraries… but somehow I really like Hoverfly 🙂 It is a simple, lightweight library that may perform tests in different modes like simulation, spying, capture, or diffing. You can use  Java DSL to build request matchers to response mappings. Let’s include the latest version of Hoverfly in the Maven dependencies:</p>



<pre><code lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;io.specto&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;hoverfly-java-junit5&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;0.14.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>







<p>Let’s assume we have the following method in our Spring <code>@RestController</code>. Before returning a ping response for itself, it calls another service under the address <code>http://callme-service:8080/callme/ping</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@GetMapping(&#34;/ping&#34;)
public String ping() {
   String response = restTemplate
     .getForObject(&#34;http://callme-service:8080/callme/ping&#34;, 
                   String.class);
   LOGGER.info(&#34;Calling: response={}&#34;, response);
   return &#34;I&#39;m caller-service &#34; + version + &#34;. Calling... &#34; + response;
}</code></pre>







<p>Now, we will create the test for our controller. In order to use Hoverfly to intercept outgoing traffic we register HoverflyExtension <strong>(1)</strong>. Then we may the Hoverfly object to create a request mather and simulate an HTTP response <strong>(2)</strong>. The simulated response body is <code>I&#39;m callme-service v1</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootTest(properties = {&#34;VERSION = v2&#34;}, 
    webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@ExtendWith(HoverflyExtension.class) // (1)
public class CallerCallmeTest {
    
   @Autowired
   TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

   @Test
   void callmeIntegration(Hoverfly hoverfly) {
      hoverfly.simulate(
            dsl(service(&#34;http://callme-service:8080&#34;)
               .get(&#34;/callme/ping&#34;)
               .willReturn(success().body(&#34;I&#39;m callme-service v1.&#34;)))
      ); // (2)
      String response = restTemplate
         .getForObject(&#34;/caller/ping&#34;, String.class);
      assertEquals(&#34;I&#39;m caller-service v2. Calling... I&#39;m callme-service v1.&#34;, response);
   }
}</code></pre>







<p>We can easily customize Hovefly behavior with the <code>@HoverflyConfig</code> annotation. By default, Hoverfly works in proxy mode. Assuming we want it to act as a web server we need to set the property <code>webserver</code> to <code>true</code> <strong>(1)</strong>. After that, it will listen for requests on  <code>localhost</code> and the port indicated by the <code>proxyPort</code> property.  In the next step, we will also enable Spring Cloud <code>@LoadBalancedClient</code> to configure a static list of target URLs instead of dynamic discovery <strong>(2)</strong>. Finally, we can create a Hoverfly test. This time we are intercepting traffic from the web server listening on the <code>localhost:8080</code> <strong>(3)</strong>.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = 
   SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@HoverflyCore(config = 
   @HoverflyConfig(logLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG, 
                    webServer = true, 
                    proxyPort = 8080)) // (1)
@ExtendWith(HoverflyExtension.class)
@LoadBalancerClient(name = &#34;account-service&#34;, 
                    configuration = AccountServiceConf.class) // (2)
public class GatewayTests {

    @Autowired
    TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Test
    public void findAccounts(Hoverfly hoverfly) {
        hoverfly.simulate(dsl(
            service(&#34;http://localhost:8080&#34;)
                .andDelay(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).forAll()
                .get(any())
                .willReturn(success(&#34;[{\&#34;id\&#34;:\&#34;1\&#34;,\&#34;number\&#34;:\&#34;1234567890\&#34;,\&#34;balance\&#34;:5000}]&#34;, &#34;application/json&#34;)))); // (3)

        ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response = restTemplate
                .getForEntity(&#34;/account/1&#34;, String.class);
        Assertions.assertEquals(200, response.getStatusCodeValue());
        Assertions.assertNotNull(response.getBody());
    }
}</code></pre>







<p>Here’s the load balancer client configuration created just for the test purpose.</p>



<pre><code lang="java">class AccountServiceInstanceListSuppler implements 
    ServiceInstanceListSupplier {

    private final String serviceId;

    AccountServiceInstanceListSuppler(String serviceId) {
        this.serviceId = serviceId;
    }

    @Override
    public String getServiceId() {
        return serviceId;
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;List&lt;ServiceInstance&gt;&gt; get() {
        return Flux.just(Arrays
                .asList(new DefaultServiceInstance(serviceId + &#34;1&#34;, 
                        serviceId, 
                        &#34;localhost&#34;, 8080, false)));
    }
}</code></pre>







<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>As you probably figured out, I used all that Java libraries with Spring Boot apps. Although Spring Boot comes with a defined set of external libraries, sometimes we may need some add-ons. The Java libraries I presented are usually created to solve a single, particular problem like e.g. test data generation. It’s totally fine from my perspective. I hope you will find at least one position from my list useful in your projects.  </p>

                            <p id="p1">When is the last time your iPhone <em>truly</em> surprised you?</p>
<p id="p2">The answer to this question is a fascinating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rorschach test</a> that can say a lot about a person’s relationship with Apple’s mobile platform. Some might say it was over a decade ago, when they feasted their eyes upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retina display</a> for the first time in 2010. Some might say it happened when the iPhones got bigger – and sales <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-q1-2015-results-74-6-billion-revenue-74-5-million-iphones-21-4-million-ipads-sold/" rel="noopener noreferrer">skyrocketed</a> – with the iPhone 6 lineup in 2014. Others might argue that it happened with <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/iphone-x-a-new-frontier/#face-id" rel="noopener noreferrer">Face ID on the iPhone X</a>, or the first time they tried Portrait or <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/iphone-11-pro-in-rome/2/#night-mode-and-the-eternal-city" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night mode</a>, or perhaps when they first took an ultra-wide shot.</p>
<p id="p3">My point is: if you ask someone about the last time an iPhone truly surprised them, chances are they’ll reply with a <em>hardware</em> feature. That’s not a shocker: Apple prides itself upon the tight integration they’ve been able to achieve between the iPhone’s hardware and iOS; they’ve successfully managed to turn their design philosophy into <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a selling point</a> of their entire ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p4">People buy iPhones because they know they’re going to work well for a long time, and, usually, because the model they’re getting has a cool new gimmick they want to try. For this reason, it’s not absurd to postulate that, by and large, the iPhone’s software serves to enable hardware sales and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/apples-services-revenue-hits-a-record-19-8b-in-q2-reaches-825m-paid-subscriptions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">subscriptions</a>. I do not mean this pejoratively: I like Apple’s approach, otherwise I wouldn’t be writing <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/ios-reviews/" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual reviews</a> about their operating systems. But I also recognize that on the iPhone (the situation is the exact opposite on iPad) the software now largely takes the backseat compared to hardware and services.</p>
<p id="p5">Which is why whenever the iPhone’s <em>software</em> truly surprises me, I get excited.</p>
<p id="p7">Software-related surprises are more rarefied on iOS these days, but the kind of people who are reading this story can point to a few examples in our recent history. Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-acquires-workflow/" rel="noopener noreferrer">buying Workflow</a>, turning it into a system app, and outright claiming that Shortcuts is the future of automation was a surprise. The extent to which Apple integrated <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/3/#dark-mode" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark mode in iOS 13</a> was a surprise.<sup id="fnref-70381-OLED"><a href="#fn-70381-OLED" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup> The arrival of two iPad features – <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-14-the-macstories-review/7/#picture-in-picture-for-iphone" rel="noopener noreferrer">Picture in Picture</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/21/#iphone-drag-and-drop" rel="noopener noreferrer">inter-app drag and drop</a> – on iPhone felt like a surprise. But, of course, no modern feature comes close to the surprise that we all witnessed with iOS 14 two years ago: <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-14-the-macstories-review/3/#home-screen" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renewed focus on user personalization</a> with custom Home Screen widgets and the ability to create multiple Home Screens.<sup id="fnref-70381-dynamicIsland"><a href="#fn-70381-dynamicIsland" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8">That’s why, following last year’s welcome (if perhaps a tad uninspired) <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality-of-life update that was iOS 15</a>, I’m excited about a new version of iOS again.</p>
<p id="p9">iOS 16, launching today for a variety of iPhone models dating back to the iPhone 8, marks Apple’s triumphant return to user personalization, with a twist: while in 2020 customization might have felt like a happy <a href="https://www.imore.com/aesthetic-af-ios-14-home-screen-trend-highlights-limitations-customizability" rel="noopener noreferrer">consequence</a> of Apple’s engineering, this time the company has <em>intentionally</em> marketed iOS 16 as an update that will make an iPhone feel truly your own. As we explored in <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-16-the-macstories-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer">June</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-16-impressions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">July</a>, the first thing you see on your iPhone – the Lock Screen – is fundamentally changing in iOS 16. With the ability to create multiple Lock Screens, choose from a diverse collection of wallpaper sets, and customize each one with widgets, you’ll now have endless possibilities for the screen you always see when you pick up your iPhone.</p>
<p id="p10">Sure, there’s an argument to be made for Lock Screen widgets also being developed in service of new hardware, but I don’t think that takes away from the breadth of this feature and how Apple created a whole narrative around wallpapers, widgets, photos, and Focus modes this year. As you’ll see, the customizable Lock Screen will be the <a href="https://twitter.com/maplecocaine/status/1080665226410889217" rel="noopener noreferrer">main character</a> of this review: I’ve had a lot of fun exploring different permutations of my Lock Screen this summer, and I’ve been able to test dozens of widgets from third-party developers, which I’ll also showcase in this story.</p>
<p id="p11">In keeping with <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer">my theory</a> that modern iOS updates always need to have a little bit of something for everyone, there’s a ton of other (some bigger, some smaller) features I’ll be covering in this review.<sup id="fnref-70381-summerSeries"><a href="#fn-70381-summerSeries" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></sup> Messages, one of my most used apps on iPhone, has received a substantial update with the ability to edit and un-send messages, making it, in some ways, even superior to WhatsApp for me now. Mail – of all apps – has gotten a major upgrade with modern features such as scheduled send and, almost unbelievably, a revamped search that actually works. Reminders has officially turned into a serious task manager with even more filters for smart lists and the ability to create and share templates with others.</p>
<p id="p12">The new Lock Screen takes center stage this year and everything else pales in comparison to the massive update it received, but, overall, I find iOS 16 a more fun and useful update than iOS 15.</p>
<p id="p13">So, as with every September: let’s dive in.</p>
